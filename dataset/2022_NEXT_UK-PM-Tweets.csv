1843,2022-07-26 14:36:38+05:30,sarahisitme,My take on the leadership contest. Whoever gets the Crown got it in an  illegitimate way. To me neither has integrity for seizing on an orchestrated coup. Boris should be reinstated immediately. #ReinstateBoris #Coup #LizTruss
1844,2022-07-26 14:35:39+05:30,jf_hanley,If only #LizTruss had brought a big #handbag to the debate! Mind you #NeverRishiSunak showed his true #misogynistic colours.  He's finished but the #BBC will try everything to get him elected. #DefundTheBBC
1845,2022-07-26 14:35:15+05:30,andysmi50387849,Watching the PM debate last night  the one overriding fact is that both candidates are head and shoulders above anything #Starmer and his totally inadequate shadow cabinet has to offer. I thought #LizTruss just edged it and #RishiSunak interrupted far too often #NeverLabour
1846,2022-07-26 14:32:29+05:30,autozee,What is this woke mansplaining nonsense? If #LizTruss is talking nonsense #RishiSunak has a right to challenge her on it #ToryLeadershipContest
