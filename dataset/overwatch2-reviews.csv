ahdok,0,August 21,547,69,0,Not Recommended,"Alright, let's actually provide a constructive review. Why are people ""review bombing"" Overwatch 2?We paid for Overwatch, we supported it throughout its lifespan, it was popular and liked by its community, and turning a happy profit each year. When Blizzard announced Overwatch 2, the big new feature they announced, the entire premise that made it ""worth the sequel treatment"" was the PvE campaign mode. Hero talent trees, customizable abilities, an expansive co-op campaign that would add to the story and lore. We were told it was going to be so much work that they wouldn't be putting out updates for Overwatch any more, they were re-allocating the staff to work on this new project.With no updates, and no content, Overwatch started to get stale... people grew tired and bored, spending less time in the game, or moving on. Many of us stuck with the product, playing a little each week just to keep fresh... waiting for the new campaign mode. For a lot of us, playing became a chore, something we were doing out of habit, so we'd be ready for the new campaign...But the new campaign wasn't the premise that established OW2, it was the pretext. It was a lie. Blizzard abandoned the PvE campaign a full YEAR before OW2 launched - but continued to push it in marketing as the big new feature. It's even in the announcement trailer for OW2, and on the roadmaps. They knew they'd canned it 12 months earlier, but they knew that's what people wanted, so kept putting it front and centre to get people's money, to get people to buy into the project. They took our trust and monetized it.-----What does OW2 ACTUALLY offer then? What did they work on for those two years that was so important that they couldn't make content for OW1, the product people paid for and were supporting?1) They overhauled the graphical engine:Before, Overwatch would play on a relatively low spec computer, and it'd be smooth. Now, it stutters and stammers in the menus. They've added this weird shiny plastic finish to everything in the world, heroes and environment alike - so where before, heros would ""pop"" against the background and be easy to follow, now everything has the same texture to it, and it all merges together into visual noise - especially at longer ranges. They've compensated for how bad this looks by adding lots of additional flashy effects and explosions, that makes it much harder to see anything amidst the chaos. A PvP game at this pace relies heavily on quick disambiguation of what you're looking at, so you can react and compete, and the new engine makes this impossible without turning all the effects back off... meaning that the two years of development is for a feature best disabled.The new engine also has a weird slippery ""feel"" to it. Reviewers who'd played Overwatch for 50 hours came into Overwatch 2 and reported ""look! it's the same Overwatch you love, but it's F2P now! Just ignore the monetization and you can play this great game for free!"" Established long term players with thousands of hours were on reddit complaining that their hitboxes were all over the place and shots that would previously ""feel"" like a dead certain hit were just completely whiffing, and they didn't understand why. All the timings are messed up.2) They reworked most of the heroes:TLDR: they screwed up the game balance. Previously, one of the biggest appeals of Overwatch was that you could find a hero that suited your play style, and main them, getting good at whatever suited you best. Some people like sniping, or hitscan run and gun, some people aren't good at reactionary aim and instead liked to focus on positioning, tactics and strategy. You could make a big positive different to your team by playing lucio or mercy, and paying attention to your surroundings, and positioning yourself in the right place at the right time to make the difference. With Overwatch 2, the damage and healing behaviour has been reworked heavily. Now, the one tank on the team is insanely chunky, and it's near impossible to kill them quickly - with healer support, they can just stand in the line of fire and laugh. Everyone else dies almost immediately, regardless of who their aggressor is. Team-fighting now is very one-note, you have one tank who's immortal if they have support, and you have four hitscan DPS characters following them - there's not a lot of difference between supports and DPS characters. The teams try to pick off the other team's DPS/Support characters, and when they pick a few off, they can finish the tank and take the objective. Repeat. There's no room for variation in play style at all, you either play a DPS and try to kill the other team DPS, or you play a tank, and try to position correctly - maybe picking off an enemy hero that gets too close to you.I understand a lot of this came from feedback at the professional levels, where support players were complaining that they wanted to have more direct impact in teamfights, they wanted the game to feel more like other FPS games - but for a large portion of Overwatch's playerbase specifically, the appeal of the game was that you could do something else and still matter.3. They got INCREDIBLY greedy with the monetization...It's a longstanding argument that lootboxes are terrible in modern gaming... but Overwatch was one of the few examples of Lootboxes done right. Most of the long-term players of the game actually liked the system, that just rewarded you for playing the game and let you unlock whatever content you wanted relatively quickly. I started playing OW1 with the first anniversary, cleared the weekly boxes from arcade every week, and at the launch of OW2, I owned every single item in the game. Those who didn't have the time to invest in doing everything could still quickly unlock specific items they wanted (and let's be honest, when you have your favourite skin, how much do you care about unlocking other skins?) - and those who didn't want to spend hours unlocking stuff could spend a little cash to get it - if they wanted to.The new system puts almost everything behind a paywall. The minute number of cosmetics on the ""free"" track are often insultingly lazy, simple recolours or minor alterations, while they put serious effort into skins that you can only buy for $20. The content you can unlock by grinding often feels like it only exists to drag you into interfaces that advertise the paid content for you. Even content from the first game, that was originally free, is now paid only.Battlepass systems suck. ""Pay us for the opportunity to unlock stuff if you play a lot. If you don't you have to pay us more, or lose the stuff you already paid for."" - Limited time deals, rotating shop offers, FOMO FOMO FOMO... it reeks of manipulation and insincerity.4. Occasional DLC packs of PvE adventures.These are Blizzard's ""new"" approach to PvE. Occasional mission packs where you can get a little bit of story and a PvE mission. You can pay (in my UK currency) £13 for the DLC pack, or £35 (the cost of a good indie game"" for the ""ultimate bundle"".So here's the thing - this content is the same amount of content, and the same pace of release as the old mission scenarios - it's just now, instead of them being a free event to get people excited about playing and encourage their friends to join up - now they're paid DLC. Nobody likes paying a regular subscription for a product that they previously owned completely. It doesn't make anyone like Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Office, and it doesn't make anyone like Blizzard.-----So this is why people are ""review bombing"" your game. You took something we paid for, supported and enjoyed for years, lied to us about your plans, and turned it into trash. Now you're telling us to pay for features and content we previously enjoyed in the game we paid for. It's greedy, it's cynical, it's manipulative, and you've lost our trust.Also you should fire Bobby Kotick."

Ornge,295,August 10,966,239,1,Not Recommended,"Overwatch 2 has no respect for you, it's an attempt to pry open your wallet while masquerading as the game it used to be. I picked up the game in 2016 and was instantly hooked like so many others. Overwatch remained my favourite shooter for years - even during the draught of content on the run up to OW2.While it retains its charming design, wonderful cast of characters and some of the best multiplayer maps I've ever played on, OW2 brought a few enormous fundamental downgrades that leave it critically flawed. Let me explain; #1 - Heroes in battlepass The biggest change, this alone put all the nails in the coffin. Overwatch is a game based around hero picks and team synergy. Every single character brings unique advantages, pairing well with some and poorly with others. Overwatch used to have a few heroes introduced every year completely free for everyone to play. Overwatch 2 now expects you to either grind to unlock new characters, or pony up cash for the Battlepass to play them on release (or £9 each for old characters).This doesn't sound game breaking at a first glance, but now consider the fact you can queue into competitive games without the full roster of characters.This is a core gameplay feature, in a competitive game, behind a paywall.How can there be fair competition if one team has more options than the other? And purely because they paid for it? Sounds a bit like pay to win, but I'll let you decide for yourself. #2 - The battlepass itself, and the new approach to cosmetics I've never really been opposed to the idea of battlepass systems, but compared to other games OW2's passes are a joke. Each pass has 80 levels of stuff, usually 8 skins (with a very nice customisable one at the end) and a bunch of other stuff to pad it out - as is the norm. This filler stuff ranges from titles and nameplates to emotes. I believe they've recently added credits in there, which is a great step forward, but doesn't undo the aforementioned critical misstep of including core gameplay features behind a paywall.Cosmetics have always been a huge part of Overwatch, the skins are designed by insanely talented artists with equally talented modellers. These skins continue to be fantastic, but the prices are insulting. Legendary skins (ones that aren't just recolours) are on average around £20+ each.These used to be obtained via lootboxes, you'd get one every level up which tends to be insanely frequent. In my time playing I only bought boxes on a few occasions and still managed to get most skins for most characters. Most people's argument for them bringing in the store was that the generous lootbox system was losing them money - this is simply wrong. In 2019 (3 years after launch) Overwatch had already made $1billion via lootboxes. There's now essentially no free way to get skins, unless you want to grind challenges for months on end for a single legendary. #3 - The PvE I never had too much interest in the PvE - but it was the driving point behind the whole idea of Overwatch 2.That's what we were told anyway, it ended up just being a bait and switch to implement all these new monetisation systems. Hell, even after the ""cancellation"" of PvE we're still getting PvE missions? Except they're now being sold as individual packs, just another way to squeeze your wallet. In Summary If you like competitive shooters - Overwatch 2 has no competitive integrity.If you like collecting cosmetics - Overwatch 2 expects you to hand over your entire walletThe game is fun, I still feel the experience I love so much in there, it's just damaged by such intrusive greed I can't recommend it to anyone."

Bobodemon,0,August 19,933,69,0,Not Recommended,"Overwatch 2 Director's response to the negative Steam reviews [overwatch.blizzard.com]Let's break this down. We've heard from many of our core players that the game is in the best state it's ever been, and many have told us that it feels like we're really listening to their feedback and that this season is a culmination of that. It’s so awesome to hear. Leading with this in the opening paragraph in the same blog post that addresses widespread backlash? Are you joking? We also launched on Steam last week, and, although being review-bombed isn't a fun experience, it's been great to see lots of new players jump into Overwatch 2 for the first time. You're painting yourself as the victim while dealing with valid, deserved criticism. Many of the reviews on Steam mention the cancellation of the much larger component of PvE that was announced in 2019 as one of their primary reasons for dissatisfaction with the game. I get that. That announcement was about an ambitious project that we ultimately couldn't deliver. You are deceiving people into believing that you are addressing people's criticism when you aren't even addressing the main problems. If we can’t turn back the clock, then what can we do? You can turn back the clock by going back to the original monetization model of Overwatch 1 and giving the people who bought Overwatch 1 the ability to turn the clock back themselves by giving back the game that they paid for. We can keep adding to and improving Overwatch 2. That is how we move forward. This means more maps, heroes, game modes, missions, stories, events, cool cosmetics, and features - an ever-expanding, evolving, and improving game. You're basically saying ""we can continue to improve the game by continuing to do what we've been doing and give people the bare minimum of what is expected."" This is the future of Overwatch. One where we will continually create and innovate on what is making the game great now for the players who are playing now. The game isn't ""great now."" If it was we wouldn't see tons of backlash on Steam. And if you're only making it great for ""the players who are playing now"", I guess that means you only care about those that are loyal and not those that are leaving and criticizing the game.What a horrible, tone-deaf response."

To make matters worse, they shut down the first game, making it unplayable for people who purchased it, meaning the playerbase has to move over to this free to play business model to keep playing the game.But at least it will have a promised PvE Hero mode that would feature character progression, which was a main part of the game’s selling point? no, that was cancelled. but you can buy a lighter story mission for ""only"" $15 Don't support this predatory behaviour."

*(except the barebone ""story"" missions that are just 10 minutes long, with no replayability at all, and that you even have to PAY 15 bucks to play them)On top of that, as an excuse for ""working"" for all the cancelled stuff, they left in the dust the original game with 3 years of no content at all, because ""they were focusing on making the sequel"".So, what they added in the ""new"" game after these 3 years of no content?A Battle Pass instead of Loot BoxesThe worst scummy monetization system I've ever seen. Literally everything has to be paid now, including 7+ year old skins that cost 19 euros each.5v5 instead of 6v6 (which means a hero balance way more broken than before)Only 3 new heroes (a rate of 1 hero per year)6 new maps (but they also REMOVED 5 maps)THAT'S IT! What was the point of the ""2"" in the title then?Is literally the same game as 2016, but with even less stuff than before.Player levels? GoneMedals? GoneEnd game cards? Gone""Looking for Group"" feature? GoneOn-fire system? Gone initially, and re-added later as a ""new content"" (L.M.F.A.O.)2CP mode? They had no idea of how to balance it, so they just removed it from the core game entirely.Oh yeah, almost forgot. NEW HEROES ARE LOCKED BEHIND THE BATTLE PASS!!!Imagine a game were switching heroes is part of his core gameplay, but you can't pick a specific hero that may be useful in that moment, because you haven't unlocked it. How stupid that sounds? Well, Blizzard thought it was a good idea.You want to play the new hero instantly? Buy the pass and you'll unlock it right away.You don't want to buy the pass? Then be ready to grind like hell, because you have to reach level 45 (out of 80!) of the BP to unlock the hero!As this wasn't enough, who bought the original game in 2016 and spent thousands of hours like me, has no choice but stop playing entirely or being stuck playing this hell of a mess with extremely predatory monetization, because they SHUT DOWN the original game despite saying that OW1 and OW2 were going to be playable together**, so there's no way back.How's that even fair?** https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1190349407486529537 All those bad decisions, led to this moment were they CRAWL to Steam and ask Gaben to save their dying game and hoping something will change.Company of clowns."

Reixi2525,78,August 14,673,798,0,Not Recommended,"Instead of wasting your time and money on this ""game"", here's a recipe for a Black Forest cake (or the Portal cake).Chocolate Cake:- 1 3/4 cups (250g) all-purpose flour, sifted- 2/3 cup (65g) natural unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted- 2 teaspoons baking soda- 1 teaspoon baking powder- 1 teaspoon salt- 2 cups (400g) granulated sugar- 2 large eggs- 1/2 cup (120 ml) neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable oil- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract- 1 cup (240 ml) buttermilk- 1 cup (240 ml) hot waterCherries and Cherry Syrup:- 1 cup drained, canned cherries- 1/4 cup Kirsch, or another cherry liqueur- Cherry juice from canned cherries (drain cherries and reserve the juice)Whipped Cream Frosting:- 3 cups (720 ml) heavy cream, cold- 1/2 cup (58g) powdered sugar, siftedOptional Decorations:- 200g/7 oz. chocolate shavings- Fresh whole cherriesInstructions- To make the chocolate cake: Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C. Generously butter two 8-inch cake pans that are at least 2-inches high, and dust with cocoa powder, tapping the ramekins slightly to remove any excess.- In a large bowl, place flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar. Mix until combined. Set aside.- In a medium bowl, mix together eggs, oil, vanilla, buttermilk, and water (pour the water slowly so it won’t cook the eggs). Whisk until smooth. Add egg mixture into flour mixture and mix until smooth. Don’t overbeat – batter will be lumpy at first, but mix gently and eventually stir with a whisk just until smooth. The batter will be thin and liquid. That’s ok.- Scrape batter into prepared pans. Bake cakes for 30-35 minutes (depending on your oven – this might take longer), or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs. Allow to cool for 10 minutes in the pan before unmolding, then let cakes cool completely on a wire rack. I recommend wrapping the cakes in plastic wrap and refrigerate or freeze them for several hours before cutting them. Cut each cake layer in half horizontally.To make the syrup: Place drained cherries in a medium bowl, and add to the bowl 1/4 cup Kirsch and 1/2 cup cherry juice from can. Leave to soak at room temperature for 30 minutes or more, then drain cherries in a sieve over a bowl, keeping both the cherries and syrup. Add more cherry juice to the syrup to get 3/4 cup syrup (you won't need the rest of the juice, discard it or save for another use). This will be the soaking syrup for the cake layers.To make the whipped cream: Using a stand mixer or hand mixer with a whisk attachment, beat heavy cream and powdered sugar until stiff peaks form. Read more about making perfect whipped cream here.Assembly: Place one cake layer on a cake stand or plate and brush with 1/3 of the cherry syrup. Cover top with a thick layer of whipped cream frosting (about 1 cup) and top with 1/3 of the cherries. Repeat twice more with remaining layers and top with the last cake layer (there’s no need to soak the top layer with syrup). Frost the top and sides of the cake with whipped cream. If you want, reserve some of the whipped cream, about 1½ cups, for decorating the top. Use a pastry bag with a large flower tip, and pipe rounds around the top. Top with whole cherries. Cover the sides and top with chocolate shavings, if desired. Store cake in the fridge, covered, for up to 4 days.(Recipe found on PrettySimpleSweet)"

prov,88,August 10,065,24,11,Not Recommended,"Pros:+ It’s free now. + No battle.net launcher required (still need an account)+ Truly a one of a kind game; even 7 years later there is nothing quite like it. Cons:- Genuinely the most garbage community I have ever had the displeasure of interacting with. When trying to learn a new hero in Quick Play, or just trying to chill with friends, entire teams will counterpick you and trash talk you constantly when you struggle. - Clueless devs in charge of game balance. They will gigabuff characters seemingly at random, make several minor, irrelevant tweaks to others, all while characters that desperately need adjustment are ignored for multiple seasons. - Despite the devs stating that this is not their intention, counterpicking is heavily rewarded over player skill. Many games are decided in the character select menu rather than on the battlefield. Expect frequent mirror matchups as a result, especially as you climb in rank, and for games to be held hostage by teammates who refuse to switch. - Once free content (skins, heroes, pve missions) is now either locked behind a paywall, or made incredibly tedious to unlock without paying. In the case of heroes, it hurts the competitive integrity of the game when each team does not have equal access to resources. This is also an insult to the people who have stuck by for years, only to be told they now need to insert more cash to further enjoy the game.- The game is buggier than ever before. The renowned Blizzard polish is no longer present as they try to rush out as much content as possible, regardless of the outcome. It is incredibly rare to play a match without having at least one death or missed kill be attributed to a bug. Overwatch will always be special to me which is why it’s so heartbreaking to see it suffer through greed and mismanagement. You might enjoy the game but it’s no secret that the good days of Overwatch are long gone."

fishy,0,August 12,769,146,0,Not Recommended,"This game has been review bombed and I've seen backlash from others saying how its unfair. Let me tell you firsthand, no it is not! In my opinion this is more than deserved for what Blizzard has done. As someone who has played hundreds of hours of both Overwatch 1 and 2, I have a good idea of what is going on.This is the result of an extremely passionate group of people who have time and time again been let down by blizzard. People who have committed countless hours to playing, watching, and consuming Overwatch content over the years.Overwatch 1 is looked back fondly from fans across all genres of games. Although it had points of low interest, nobody can disagree that for a large part of its lifespan, it was beloved and popular. (and no it is not just ""nostalgia"". Blizzard has created some amazing games initially that dropped off hard after a certain point) (WoW, Diablo, Hearthstone) Overwatch 2 under delivered on basically every front. Let me list some examples!- The new game mode push the robot and flashpoint are generally detested by the community. 2CP wasn't the best, but is still missed and preferred.- The matchmaking is clunky as ever, prioritizing getting into games faster over game quality. What this means is, you get into a match faster ( it is still pretty slow LMAO ) but the game quality is worse. People have complained about this constantly. You can literally search it up and see articles written about it. 90% (no this is not an exaggeration) of games are one sided. One team stomps the other and it's a wrap. Win or lose, this is just not fun or engaging.- They didn't even bother to change the training room from Overwatch 1!!!- The scummy f2p model they use. Constantly shoving the battle pass down your throat. It costs.. 20 dollars to buy a legendary skin! Remember how everyone loved lootboxes and it made that aspect of the game exciting? Completely removed!- Most maps weren't even changed from OW1. - Hey remember the PvE content we promised? yeah no how about 15 dollars for some lackluster missions that were free in OW1.- They are releasing new heroes on a schedule, but if you don't buy the battlepass be prepared to sink a lot of time to upgrade your battlepass in order to... play a new character in a team based shooter revolving around hero counter picks and strategy. - Lackluster seasonal events, that for the most part are copy paste from OW1.- Toxicity. I have been told to k*ll myself multiple times, reported these people, and nothing happens to them. Very fun. It is by far the most toxic multiplayer game I play. (on par with league) Oh noooo the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game got reviewbombed, the one that constantly under-delivered and went back on their promises. I understand that many people who work on this game aren't in control of these things, but this is just unbelievable at this point. No this game is not the worst thing to exist, you can get some fun out of it. (I play with my friend from time to time) But over time you will begin to resent and loathe the game and the people who created it. It is not worth any time investment. This game will pressure you into their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ overpriced micro-transactions, under deliver on everything they promise, and squeeze every last drop of money they can out of you."

DragonEngineer,0,August 15,233,22,99,Not Recommended,"I have over 1000 hours in Overwatch 1 and 2 combined. Many things killed my interest for playing this game actively.1: Heroes locked behind Battle Pass or obnoxious grind: The fact that you either pay to have a competitive advantage for your team, or obnoxiously grind for the hero, which is Tier 45 of the BP. If you missed the BP, you have to WIN 35 games of a role you may not necessarily enjoy in order to unlock the hero, not ""play X games, wins grant double progress"", WIN only count towards unlock progress! And you can't progress for more than 1 hero at the same time. This means if you start playing Overwatch in Season 7, you need to win 210 games just to unlock the 6 new Overwatch 2 heroes!2: Solo Tanking has been a miserable experience ever since the move from 6v6 to 5v5, and created a whole lot of problems with balance and powerful abilities (see how Sleep Dart had to have lower duration on tanks). Discord and Antinade remained a problem in solo-tank environment and removed lots of tank synergises. Open queue is actually more fun for me as a tank player at this point.3: Toxicity is still not being addressed. Even in QP people are flaming you for no reason. I have reported many players for toxicity but nothing is addressed. It's so bad to the point I had to turn off all text chat and voice chat so I can actually have a fun time in the game.4: Workshop has been a very welcoming addition to the game, but right now it's not being actively updated. Sure we got the new projectiles extensions which we are grateful for. But there's still many issues, like HUD alignment being incorrect (Left and Right HUD should be Left/Right aligned like in OW1, not centered aligned), Many workshop actions/values not working well with the new OW2 heroes, such as setting cooldown and detecting ability usage. Also we need more Deathmatch maps, would be nice if every map can be available for FFA/TDM."

Don't say ""But I am supporting the devs!"", you are not. This is not an indie company, the developers are salaried workers. Your money goes straight into the executives' Christmas bonus.However... you may notice this game is free, you can play it without spending any money, so should you? Probably not.The game's balance is constantly in a cycle of being so close to good, then the devs completely ruining it and making some hero overpowered for seemingly no reason.People always say ""if everyone is overpowered, no one is overpowered"" and this game is proof that that is not the case and instead it just results in every hero either able to insta-kill, or not able out-damage the healing. It isn't fun.I just want the game to be good and I want the PvE mode with hero talents."

TedSoftly,0,August 10,559,11,0,Not Recommended,"Stay AwayBefore anyone claims I am a bot just spamming a negative review, I preordered Overwatch 1; between my friends and I, we have clocked in thousands of hours playing solo and together. Now, only one of my friends from that group still plays this game. I understand, what was left behind by Overwatch 1 was and still is phenomenal, but the pros in this case, do not outweigh the cons left in the wake of this sequel. In short, if you do not care about details, I want my money back; or at least them to bring back the servers for the game I paid for, not this garbage. This game will strong arm you to part with a considerable amount of cash, where the original game did not; this game has only seen an increase in cheating and toxicity; this game has horrendous balancing issues that keeps getting compounded with each new update due to the new 5v5 format. All in all, this game, and I'm not even joking when I say this, got most of my friends to play Team Fortress 2 again, and even in the middle of the bot crisis, we had significantly more fun with it than our time with Overwatch 2. Stay away from this game, it is a hollow shell of what it used to be, which is a great shame.In Depth ReviewOverwatch 1 was a fantastic game like no other, even compared to TF2. It was fun and exciting; for years we all would anticipate the drop of a new hero, a new map, new cosmetics. The game has had its ups and downs, no game is ever perfect (especially one continuously getting updates), but at its core, no matter how bad it had gotten, it was still fun. I’ll spare the details as many people probably have said in their reviews, or you may know of it, they had announced Overwatch 2 after a long drought of slow-going updates. When OW2 came out, I was initially positive to it, the new 5v5 format was fun, I liked the new heroes, Push was fun. The biggest problem for me was the new cash shop and battlepass system (more on that later). I personally wasn’t really hopeful that PvE mode was going to be good, and as such didn’t care much about it (although this soon would be the catalyst to all in my friend group leaving the game). But as time has gone on, and as I noticed more people becoming toxic, and I noticed the game becoming stale, it came to a point where I just had enough. So, where to begin?5v5 and BalancingThe biggest difference between the two games is 5v5 instead of 6v6. At first, I enjoyed the change, I felt games where faster, and enjoyed the lack of shields that had plagued the first game for years. But, as time went on, I realized a lot of issues with this new format and found myself enjoying it less and less. The truth is, the game was not meant for 5v5. It literally just makes the game worse in every way and makes balancing atrocious.The reason for this is that a core part of the game’s design is synergies and counter picks. You pick a hero to fight against the other team’s heroes, and you pick a hero that works well with another team member’s pick. The most important role for synergizing picks is typically support and tank. This worked to great effect in OW, but as time went on in OW2, it was clear that the move to 5v5 is a mistake.The removal of a tank causes major problems, the first is that the tank role is missing a core part of the game: synergies. The second is that tanking has now become a boring game of rotating to counter pick and every tank game feels relatively the same. Lastly, this has put a burden on tanking as a whole since there’s only one person to fulfill the most important role now. A side effect is that now, instead of a team-based game, the game has become a tank-based game. Having a bad tank that refuses to play any hero other than Roadhog, or Sigma, etc. will lose you games if the other team has the counter-pick hero. This issue leads to further issues with balancing, but for the sake of brevity, as I have a lot to say, I hope this explanation paints a clear picture on why 5v5 is bad for the game’s health. In short, 6v6 needs to come back, but it never will now that they broke their promise of PvE, if they revert 5v5 they will have nothing to show for OW2 except for a cash shop update.Cash Shop UpdateAll in all, this game is just an update that went away from lootboxes to a cash shop, in theory this should be great—we all hated lootboxes—but Blizzard in their infinite greed has made the experience related to cosmetics and microtransactions WORSE. Now, instead of having every single player on the same playing field with every character unlocked, you are forced to unlock them or buy the battlepass, this is incredibly dumb and makes the game worse: especially since they said, back when the first game released, that locking heroes behind paywalls was a bad idea. And are these heroes worth it? So far, no, they’re all just incredibly mid which doesn’t even make you want to buy them or make you want to get excited for them. Because the truth is, paying for heroes means that if they’re too weak people will complain that they got scammed, if they’re too strong then people will complain the game is pay to win. This is not a MOBA where you have to make a hero pick and stick to it before the game start, this is a game with dynamic, on the fly decision making which extends to hero swapping. This decision once again goes against one of the fundamental design philosophies of the first game. It’s an absolutely baffling decision made by people who don’t understand the game but just want to make more money.Speaking of making more money, the cosmetics. They are atrociously price, $20-$30 for a single skin. No skin is worth that much no matter how dripped out it’ll make you look. Every skin is now earned with money, another downgrade from the first game. In the original, you would play and level up your account, each time you level up, you get a lootbox. Lootboxes in OW would give you random cosmetics or coins to farm for specifically purchasing cosmetics. The only thing to buy was the lootboxes. Say what you will about lootboxes, I didn’t like them either, but I also think the new greedy shop is worse. Especially when you realized they gutted the entire account progression system from the first game and left you with a multi-year, grind heavy, avenue to unlocking a single cosmetic you want. I could feasibly grind for a skin I wanted in a couple months’ time in OW, in this game, I am left with no choice but to buy the item I want at an abhorrent price.Misc. Thoughts and ConclusionI am already on the verge of writing a whole dissertation on why this game is just Overwatch 0.5, and how they keep fumbling around with bad ideas to eventually, and hopefully, land back to where Overwatch 1 was already at. My friends and I didn’t particularly care about the PvE, but we were mad when we learned it was canceled, why? Because, for years we got nothing, they pushed out an update and pretended it was a sequel, then they lied to us and led us to believe that PvE was coming along and great, when in reality (and they let this slip after the announcement)—that they knew PvE was canceled before OW2’s launch. They led us to believe the PvE, as promised, was coming, when they knew it was never happening.All in all, this game is a dumpster fire, it’s upsetting that a great game that I loved and put so much time into enjoying and playing is being dragged through the mud. And for what? Money. The hope that the people that will put up with it will whale out copious amounts of cash on stuff they could have gotten for free in the first game. Furthermore, I bought OW, that game was not free to play, and they deleted it. I would have been more content with the happenings of OW “2” had they let me continue playing the game I had once paid for, and the better game they had to offer. But, after what I had outlined, I think we knew why they deleted it. Stay Away."

DrNick,9,August 10,231,2,1,Not Recommended,"What can I say about this game…?I have more than 1000 hours (not in steam as you can see but in Battlenet), I’m writing this review thanking valve to FINALLY let me leave an opinion of this game. I started playing OW in 2017, specifically in September and stopped in 2023 (May)…so I can say I lived the best and the worst in this game. The game was amazing, a hero shooter pretty balanced (in characters’ synergy, not players), a lot of fanbase etc, but the lack of content (and I believe the OW League’s decay) started to dent the game, I think we can agree there were 3 major nails in its coffin:1)	Brigitte: Blizzard always overpowers its last chars/skills etc in every game, but this char broke the game, it could kill healers, dps, tanks no matter what, if you encountered Brigitte in a small corridor, you were dead, eventually they nerfed her, but still, she destroyed the synergy only by herself.2)	Role queue (ranked): An attempt to revive the number of players BUT did the opposite, this thing made me leave overwatch back then, you had to choose BEFORE KNOWING which map you were going to play in, what role you wanted to be…this had 2 cons: first you couldn’t balance your team if you had a noob or a troll, taking his role and helping your team, and second, in some maps I played better for my team in one role than another, for example: defending Hanamura/Rialto with tank, but attacking oasis/nepal with healer or dps.3)	2 types of Ranked (Role queued or free): when Role queue didn’t work, they made some changes in quick play and arcade, but the important change was the free ranked, what happened? Well, if you have less players AND more ranked modes, surprise! You had a worse matchmaking so…Doing the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pve content (Halloween, winter games, lucio ball) over and over again destroyed it as well.BUT A LIGHT WAS AHEAD: They were going to give us a “new” game, at least a reworked game with FINALLY a good multiplayer pve content: new stories, maps, skill trees, etc2-3 years of development later they gave us overwatch 2 (removing OW1 which I PAID), with no pve content BUT with season pass and the promise of the future pve content. By the way they changed Mccree for Cassidy, that didn’t solve anything... On May 16th the head staff CANCELLED the promised pve content making the number “2” in “overwatch 2” lost its meaning. THEY LIED, DECEIVED AND MISLEAD US. July 19th Blizzard offers 6M to every team to not renew in Overwatch’s Leage. R.I.P.NOTE: I bought OW1, I played a lot with friends, I believed in OW2 so I bought every battle pass (with euros or coins if I had) till May (2023). I was platinum (all role queue)…so I wasn’t a god but at least I know what I’m talking about…I started this game on steam ONLY to finally tell the world my humble opinion, and my (and probably other’s) story of love and hate with this game."

Dear Reader.Curious about the flood of negative reviews towards the title from the Blizzard stable, I have to say that less than a few hours with the new OW have confirmed me in very sad conclusions. Sadly true. I've seen enough, and I write this in disappointment. Because having in my memories the solutions of 1st OW, I see prosocial regression and extreme mercantilism of the studio, which took a step backwards.Overwatch was my most played game on PlayStation including Bloodborne and Darksouls series. And now, every time I hear about OW2 I just get more and more disapproved, sad, and pity. Blizzard took what was one of the best team shooters and turned it into an action focused money hungry machine with no purpose. The game is now “free” with a giant star next to “free” because if you want any enjoyment out of it like we had with OW1 you better open your wallet multiple times. The progression system sucks, the loot sucks, the paywalls suck, and now the game sucks.During an interview with GameSpot, Blizzard confirmed that the highly anticipated PvE modes that we expected to get with OW2 are now canceled. The ENTIRE purpose of OW2 releasing was to add story driven PvE modes, and now it doesn’t exist. At all.Investigating the whole case, the PvE modes were announced in February 2021 officially, but were long known about before then. It was at this time we learned about “Hero Mode” which would add character tree’s and perks to the roster along with player progression, and of course story driven missions to explore the lore of Overwatch. It looked stellar. Then Blizzard “switched gears” and said PvE wouldn’t release alongside the newly revamped OW2, and then went completely silent about it since. Fans have been desperately asking when we would get this, and it seems Blizzard chose to ignore the fans as they knew it was canned over a year ago. OW2 is currently heading into Season 6 which will finally have it’s first new PvE event that fans have been waiting for. But given the feedback from comments of players at the turn of the title changes, every point, OW2 is clearly a sequel made for a sham. Instead of a full fledged Hero Mode, we now get copy paste PvE style missions that will be included in the games live service over the next few seasons. Blizzard already recycles events for Halloween and the holidays etc… so these missions will be very similar closed PvE missions with no depth at all, and most likely just be on a recycled schedule similar to these events.Apparently the reason for all this is Blizzard somehow forgot they made a live service game. Their team couldn’t handle creating the depth for PvE missions, or make PvE missions for that matter, so they took the content, stripped it down, and are now releasing it over several seasons instead of all at once. Some of the missions won’t even be cannon to the lore….Blizzard explains that they want to ensure new PvE content releases “as expected” while ignoring the popularity that say Lucio Ball has every time it releases, no matter how many times they recycle it. Again the whole purpose of Overwatch 2, and why it wasn’t just a simple expansion to the core game, was due to the added depth PvE was going to add. Instead all we got was a toned down OW1 and a bunch of microtransactions nobody asked for.If I haven’t been rather blunt with my opinion on the team destroying Overwatch, well here goes. Their excuses for dropping the PvE side are totally bogus in every way. A multi-billion dollar studio couldn’t find the time to build out a PvE game? Right…. Just be honest, you couldn’t monetize it and the only option that came to the table was to strip the content down and hide it within the season releases so people (hopefully) buy the passes and keep playing the lousy game. Period. They made sure all the overpriced junk on the OW2 store worked on launch, and raised prices when people were already exclaiming how expensive it was to begin with. It’s all about money.I wouldn’t be surprised if the content releases include locked new characters or enhancements of some kind, or have insanely long grinding sessions for secondary coins. I was one of the few original OW fans that played that game every day, and I played with the same dozen or so die hard people in every match, and it’s sad that Blizzard looked at us all and said “eh. Sorry.” Take the 2 off the name and go actually develop a game.Dear Reader, thank you for reading and Blizzard... ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠛⠋⠉⣉⣉⠙⠿⠋⣠⢴⣊⣙⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠟⠋⠁⠀⢀⠔⡩⠔⠒⠛⠧⣾⠊⢁⣀⣀⣀⡙⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠟⠛⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡡⠊⠀⠀⣀⣠⣤⣌⣾⣿⠏⠀⡈⢿⡜⣿⣿⣿⠿⠛⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠡⣤⣶⠏⢁⠈⢻⡏⠙⠛⠀⣀⣁⣤⢢⣿⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠰⣄⡀⠣⣌⡙⠀⣘⡁⠜⠈⠑⢮⡭⠴⠚⠉⠀⠁⠀⢀⠔⠁⣀⣤⣤⣤⣤⣤⣄⣀⠀⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠁⠀⢀⣠⢠⡀⠀⢸⠀⢼⣿⣿⣶⣭⣭⣭⣟⣛⣛⡿⠷⠶⠶⢶⣶⣤⣤⣤⣶⣶⣾⡿⠿⣫⣾⠇⠀⠀⠀⠈⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠙⠛⠛⠻⠿⠿⠿⠷⣶⣶⣶⣶⣶⣶⣶⣶⡾⢗⣿⣿⣦⣄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣴⣿⣶⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣶⣤⣄⣀⣀⣀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣀⣤⣝⡻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⡹...wake up!"
Nighty,2,August 21,282,4,0,Not Recommended,"I paid for the Collector's Edition of OW1.They now removed that, which I paid for, and replaced it with a lesser edition, bringing nothing new to the table - or at least nothing they couldn't just have done to OW1.. such as changing it to a 5v5 game. Now I can't really play the game I paid for - and quite a bit for at that. I borderline feel like I can't play OW2 at all, seeing as I'm now unable to counter - in a game all about countering, cause I have to play the game as a full-time job to get something through just gaming, or I have to pay Blizzard a fortune, such as £20 for a bloody skin. It's kind of this whole ""You have to fix our issue for us"" mentality, which Blizzard has gotten increasingly better at. The one reason for OW2 existing in the first place was removed, the PvE. They deserve the downvotes. All of them. It's not, as Blizzard claims, ""review bombing"". It's just the truth - and I hope that it hurts in this case.. so that they might learn from this.They removed a fully functioning game, to replace it with the exact same, although lesser edition - with macrotransactions.The game itself, in its core, is not terrible, the company, and its business practices however.. those are abysmal.When Jeff Kaplan said they'd change what a sequel meant... well.. sadly he wasn't wrong. I entirely get why he left. Smart man.Lastly - Whomever was in charge of putting this game on Steam, with open reviews.. so that Blizzard would finally see how people felt... that person has some impressively poor judgement."
Thavleifrim,0,August 26,105,4,0,Not Recommended,"According to the game director for this game being review bombed on steam isn't fun. I have good news for him. you are not being review bombed, these are genuine honest reviews from your community. what's not fun is when a developer promises a sequel to a game you love. then proceeds to take the game you love offline, then release the same game again with a 2 on the end and worse monetisation and none of the promised new features. but you give the game ago because the dev persists in the lie that all those new features are coming for a few months. then they announce that it was actually a lie the whole time and over watch 2 never existed. it was always just a way to extract more money from re-releasing the same game. then they spit in your face one more time by announcing an extremely watered down and diluted version of what was promised as paid DLC. thats not a fun experience and that experience is why you are getting negative reviews. if you want positive reviews give us overwatch 2, do that and il be the first to give you a positive review. until then you get this."

The new story mode is like trying to read a book written in invisible ink – you know there's supposed to be something there, but good luck finding it. And the new heroes? They're as memorable as a goldfish with short-term memory loss. As for the PvP mode, it's a masterclass in frustration, It's like they hired a team of confused hamsters to balance the game play.

𝙑𝙃𝘼𝙀𝙉,24,August 10,297,8,9,Not Recommended,"Overhyped and Underdelivered: The Sad Reality of Overwatch 2TL;DR» The reason why I installed this on Steam is to solely leave a negative review. The only thing not covered behind a paywall in this game is the free download. This piss poor excuse of a sequel is seriously underwhelming, and the disgusting community is literally fed through p*rn content. DO NOT PLAY IT.» Like most people who played the original Overwatch, everyone eagerly awaited the release of Overwatch 2 with high hopes and expectations. Unfortunately, that excitement turned into disappointment delving into the sequel. Blizzard took everything that made the first game enjoyable and tossed it out the window.Graphics» First off, the graphics and design are an absolute letdown. Overwatch’s charm lays in its vibrant and unique character designs, but Overwatch 2 seems to have taken a detour into the uncanny valley. The characters now look like they are trying too hard to be realistic, and the once-celebrated art style has been replaced with a mishmash of uninspired visuals that lack the original’s personality.Unbalanced Gameplay» Gameplay-wise, it is a mess. The new “PvE emphasis” they touted feels like a cheap attempt to cash in on the co-op trend. The missions are repetitive and lack the dynamic objectives that made the original game’s matches so engaging. It is as if the developers thought that throwing in waves of enemies would automatically translate to fun gameplay. Spoiler alert: it doesn’t. What’s worse, balancing issues from the first game seemed to have followed the developers into Overwatch 2, and perhaps even worsened. The new heroes are either overpowered or utterly useless, leaving players frustrated as they navigate through uneven matches. The development team practically tossed the concept of playtesting out the window and crossed their fingers, hoping for the best.Horrible Story» The much-anticipated story mode falls face flat. While the idea of delving into the backstories of the beloved characters was intriguing, the execution was lackluster at best. The narrative feels disjointed, and the emotional arcs are rushed and fail to make a lasting impact. It is clear that the focus was more on quantity than quality when it came to the story content.Pay-To-Win» And let’s not even get started on the microtransactions and monetization. The game seems to have taken a page out of the worst kind of free-to-play models, with players bombarded by loot boxes and cosmetics that cost an arm and a leg. The game’s approach to cosmetics feels predatory and overly aggressive. It is evident that Blizzard is more interested in squeezing money out of players than providing a satisfying and rewarding progression system.Conclusion» All in all, Overwatch 2 feels like a rushed attempt to cash in on the popularity of the original, without understanding what made the first game special. It is a shadow of its predecessor, and I cannot help but feel that the developers have let down their loyal fanbase. Save your money and stick to the original Overwatch – at least there, you will find the magic that Overwatch 2 sorely lacks.Score: 4.5/10Was this review helpful?» If so, please leave a rating. Awards are also greatly appreciated!"

Starkiller,5,August 12,107,,4,Not Recommended,"This game is a shadow of its former self. The devs let the game die in 2019 when there was no new content for 3.5 years. They promised an entire PVE campaign for OW1 and called it OW2 which would have been an entire story PvE game with high replayability and unique upgrade/build choices for your hero. There were trailers, streamers who play tested the early levels with already programmed maps, builds and much more video evidence of a standalone title. They lied to the player base that OW2 would be a seperate game from OW1 and that they will temporarily merge OW2 and OW1 until OW2 PvE releases. They knew for atleast 4 years that this will not be the case and despite of this made promises to the community that all will happen as they promised. With the start of OW2 however they fired all the old devs from OW1 (Jeff Kaplan left prior to this on his own) and hired a completely different team. To say that OW2 is full of bugs would be an understatement. Abilities glitch out. Entire maps have open spaces where you could hide during a competetive ranked game and be invulnarable to enemies. To Blizzards credit some of the bugs were fixed (some were not). But the worst offender by far was the bug that at the end of a competetive season players rank would decrease from what they actually achieved at the season end. People in GM got placed in M5 for example. Some players jumped ranks from Plat2 to Master5 without actually getting this rank during the active season. Titles from the season rank rewards got mixed up/ not delivered at all. This was the case for atleast 4 season and Blizzard adjusted the ranks 6 weeks after the new season had already started. Since the start of season 5 there were no adjustments to this day however despite the same rank bug happening again. Now they officially anounced that the so long promised PvE standalone title OW2 will be canceled. Instead they sell the game in little portions (story events) which take 20-30 mins per story mission and cost around 15€ for 4 missions. What a sad joke. I was in love with OW1 and the vison Jeff Kaplan had in mind but this transformation from a loved game to this ruthless cash grab led me to abandon this game for good. No amount of copium could convince me to trust this game again. What an end of a legacy."

Zalastor,7,August 10,140,4,0,Not Recommended,"I've been with Overwatch since its inception in 2016, pouring my heart and soul into it from day one. The exhilarating matches, the intense team dynamics, and the deep sense of camaraderie that formed over the years – it was more than just a game to me. I stood by its side through all the ups and downs, defending it from naysayers. This was a world I believed in, a haven where my friends and I found joy and refuge.Remember the promise of PvE? The potential for rich, narrative-driven experiences that would expand upon the lore we've all grown to love? It's as if those dreams were swept away, just like the hopes of countless players when Blizzard decided to cancel the PvE aspect. The game I invested years into, the very game that taught me the value of perseverance and teamwork, was stripped of its core promises.  And then there's the dark figure of Bobby Kotick, the embodiment of corporate greed and avarice. His influence on Blizzard has turned a once-beloved company into a soulless machine focused solely on profit. The departure of so many talented developers, the minds behind the magic that captivated us, left a void that's irreplaceable. What remains are the echoes of what once was.Overwatch 2's ""story"" missions. Watered-down shadows of what could have been epic tales, now treated as mere add-ons to be purchased. It's heartbreaking to see a game that was once celebrated for its creativity and innovation devolve into a monetization scheme, squeezing players dry for scraps of content that pale in comparison to the original vision.So here I am, a player who once poured blood, sweat, and tears into Overwatch, now left with a heavy heart. The spark that ignited my passion has dimmed, overshadowed by disappointment and sorrow. Overwatch 2 feels like a tombstone, a memorial to what once was, a painful reminder of a time when things were different, a time when we believed in the magic..."

FOR???? i've played hundreds of hours since OW2 ""launched in EA (apparently)"" and i've seen a total of like 3 people use them oncethese ""souvenirs"" or whatever they call them were an absolutely beyond disgustingly lazy way to add ""more emotes"" for ""each hero"" so they don't have to make a new one  for each individual hero. as well as muddying up the battlepass even more with useless garbage honestly, OW1 was the f2p model, that would have been fine and fair, i even bought lootboxes a lot just because it was a good game this model looks even more cash grabby and predatory than lootboxes even were (which is freaking saying something), and with that, i expect more content, and there simply is not enough new ""content"" to speak of everything OW2 has ""added"" minus this fake pve thing would have been added anyway; heroes and maps, that's it, the new game modes are mid at best and unnecessary in the long run if they had just worked on existing features, they're welcomed, of course, but to say they are the entire reason for ALLLLLL of this drama?no absolootlyflippityfloppitynot100% deserving of overwhelmingly negative reviews at this pointdo. better."

ColdTooth,1,August 12,36,,0,Not Recommended,"I have never been so disgusted by Blizzard Entertainment as a company. Forget the incident in Hearthstone, forget Diablo Immortal's announcement and the infamous ""You guys don't have phones?"" line, forget the company simply cancelling development of Heroes of the Storm and the esports, forget WoW's Shadowlands launch (or even Shadowlands entirely). Forget those things for a moment, even if you didn't know they existed.Blizzard simply cancelling the Hero Mode entirely, scrapping content that was shown at Blizzcon of 2019, including a talent tree system, clan system, items, and so much more, that made the game immersive, and fans were in awe of it all. They wanted to be a part of the game, they wanted to play the PvE mode alot because the Archive Missions, as short and sweet as they were, were very enjoyable. I for one am a PvE player, which might turn this review bias, but I've also amassed hundreds of hours in the PvP side of things pre 2020 (if you asked me, I really did not like the goats meta, some people did, but I found it boring and annoying), so I atleast know what I'm talking about (or so I claim).Let's just go back in time for a few moments. All the way back to 2004, two whole decades ago! Blizzard was really setting their foot in later in that year when they finally launched World of Warcraft. Dare I say it, it was one of the most successful MMOs that launched at the time, and later on in Wrath of the Lich King, it would have over 10 million players. That's alot of people. No matter who you asked at this time, Blizzard knew how to make a successful game, whether it be the raids and dungeons with the PvE side of things, or the old-school battleground systems of the PvP. There was something for everyone in WoW, and despite it now looking like a jumbled mess of new players being scared and overwhelmed, back then it was Blizzard's most prized IP at the time.So why am I talking about a completely different game in this review, even if it's by the same company? Because Blizzard knew how to do PvE stuff very well. The art direction, the gameplay, the core components of keeping players addicted either for 15 dollars a month, or to simply spend time with their friends in a Starcraft 2 game, or heck, even Diablo 3. As much as that game sucked on launch, it still went on to be a successful Blizzard game, even if it had its flaws and some glaring problems, they weren't a massive problem and the game was still praised for the PvE.What I'm trying to say is that Blizzard knows how to make PvE titles. Sure they know how to make PvP titles like the top down strategy games of Warcraft and Starcraft, and even in WoW in some degree, but their PvE was how many players were sucked in to playing their titles. It's how WoW has a thriving raiding and roleplaying community. The immersion or grind for success was always there.And then sometime later, they had a super secret project called Project Titan. Long story short, it morphed into Overwatch, and the game was set to release in 2016 as Blizzard's next title. The gameplay footage pre-launch really shows that Blizzard put so much care and effort in the original game. I was easily blown away by the gameplay in the open beta just 2 weeks before it launched. I've poured hundreds of hours into the game. Overwatch 1 has gotten many updates over its cycle, with new heroes every 3-4 months, cool seasonal updates. It really felt like the game was in a healthy and active development.Now let's return to the present, more specifically when Blizzcon 2019 was around. Overwatch 2 was announced. That's crazy, Overwatch is only 3 and a half years old at this point, why even make a sequel. Turns out the developers want to update the game hard enough to really flesh out the lore, with co-op story missions, a hero mode, and... a talent tree?!? Sign me the frick up. That sounds so amazing!And then the years start ticking. 2019 finally passed by, the hype was real. 2020 passed, with little to no new information on the Hero Mode or the story missions. 2021 passed, with only a developer stream revealing more content about PvP and maybe some teasing of PvE. At this point, we're in 2022, with quite literally no release date on Overwatch 2, no new information, and a lot of radio silence about Blizzard. Oh, and the final hero, Echo, was released in April of 2020, so Overwatch was getting very stale and not much content was shown, only seasonal stuff with cosmetics. Not even a new map.In early 2022, we got some hopes reignited that Overwatch 2 might be releasing sometime in the current year, as many content creators were signed under an NDA, and praising how Overwatch 2 looked. Finally, some good news on this title, and while it might be understandable that it took so long, perhaps that means there's a lot of content to be rummaging through, right?Right?Well... no. The PvE was not to be launched with the release of Overwatch 2, now at a date in early October of 2022. And that's a massive bummer. That's a huge drawback, but the community was still hopeful, that within a later season, the Hero Mode would be promised and hopefully be in the game soon, with that juicy talent tree and multiple, replayable missions. Right?Right?Nothing. Radio silence, as always. Blizzard's worst tactic, they don't like telling us what's in the bag, because of how fans will portray it as. And, come May of 2023, a post was made by the Overwatch development team, stating that the Hero Mode, the talent trees, and all of the stuff shown about the PvE from Blizzcon 2019, was scrapped. Gone.What happened? No really, what happened?No seriously. I'm being genuinely honest, what the ♥♥♥♥ happened? I barely swear in these kinds of rants about a company that it has to be known. From November of 2019, to October of 2022, what happened? Why is the only change to Overwatch 2 from 1 a graphics overhaul, the game going free to play, removing one less tank from the team comp (now making it 5v5), three new heroes, about 7 or so maps, a new gamemode, a battle pass system (I hate triple A titles that do this, it's not fun, it's not cool), a shop with in-game cosmetics, skins that costed you 20+ dollars with no suitable difference other than ""they look cool"", and a bunch of other things that I really want to talk about but I genuinely just can't find the words for them, I'm sure you know what they are considering this game is being review bombed so hard. Literally the top review I saw points out how little to no effort and care Overwatch 2 is compared to the r34 scene of the game.And now they migrate to Steam. Well, actually, I don't think it was Blizzard Entertainment's decision, I think it was Microsoft's decision. At least they know the battlenet launcher sucked, with them hopefully putting more of their titles in on Steam. It's a good decision, because 3rd party apps have always tried to be ""hip and cool"" and not put their stuff on Steam but the truth is, most of these launchers are horrible and outdated. Now if only Epic Games ditched their launcher- oh what am I saying.So effectively, this game is a cash grab. It originally was 60 dollars back in 2016, later reduced to I think 40 or 30? And now it's free to play. I highly encourage you to never touch this game, and if you think this review sucks, I highly encourage you to watch Death of a Game: Overwatch 2 by nerdSlayer Studios, or How Blizzard Killed Overwatch Twice by Savantics, or hell, even give SkyminSlash's Why OW2's PvE Fails, But TF2's MvM Succeeds video a watch. There's hundreds of these videos out there pointing out so many flaws and problems with Overwatch 2 and Blizzard's greed, but these three really highlighted the core issues the most.I hope you have a wonderful day after reading, and remember..No king rules forever."

shadow xtc,30,August 10,794,13,0,Not Recommended,"Things about Overwatch that makes it not worth it to play.  • no loot boxes, but instead have to buy battle passes and stupid 20 dollar skins  • a luxster xp and nothing to work for is really boring  • not as polished as the first game as we thought  • their new level system is so stupid and feels like something for children  • they made the game free to play and made the skill cap unbalanced  • rebranded the game with the goal of being able renege on the promises made for overwatch without facing a class action lawsuit or having to refund who bought it (40+ million copies) is a petty move.  • having a battle pass that locks character behind it  of course, the gameplay is better but some of the features are more of a downgrade.  this proves that overwatch is already dying and Blizzard is trying to find way to rack in the players. :)"

Leathium,0,August 10,55,,90,Not Recommended,"Well, where to start? I'm going to give this game a thumb down with no hesitant, why? because they removed Overwatch 1, or shut it down, they replaced the free loot boxes that you get every time you lvl up your account playing that gives you credit and skins for free, emotes, highlights etc with this tasteless battle pass, which again after 4 years of ""developing"" the sequel of the game which is supposed to be overwatch 2 (which turned to be in fact Overwatch 0.5 because they actually removed content of the original game) hardly anything worth the grind.You simply play the game when you feel like wanting to burn time and nothing else to do, for few pointless rewards, and not to mention they are reselling the old event skins and rewards you used to get for free every year in overwatch 1, simply milking people to make them pay real money, not to also mention the slap on people who actually bought OW1 on a full price when it released, not to mention buying the battle pass to play the new hero they release with each battle pass, when in OW1 every new hero was free from day 1 to play with.Not to even talk about how horribly snowflake the community of overwatch and how the support is just so sensitive to anything, you simply can't even be frustrated when you play, if your team is bad because the whole matching of the game is broken mess, and 90% of the matches are either roll your enemies or get rolled so hard, there are far and few matches in between that feels balanced, and if you actually want to play for free now and buy skins or anything to put on your favorite hero? good luck, you are limited to get 60 credit only a week.Doing the obnoxious weekly challenges and just not letting you play the game you want to play it, and the classic silly skin for each hero is 1500 credit, so do the match and enjoy the months grind, or just grind the free credit rewards from the battle pass, only to get a classic skin, if you want an actual new skin? lmao good luck with that, they removed older maps from OW1, and added a new mode that no one enjoys (push maps), they ruined the balance of games with the 5v5 instead of the 6v6 which was more complicated and has more planning.Each team has 1 tank, if your tank is bad good luck winning a game, if your tank rage quit, also good luck winning anything else the defeat on your screen, and so on and so forth, I could write a book about how terrible this game has turned to be else a cash grab and seeing the game actually came to steam desperately hoping for more players is honestly sickening me, but yeah, play it with friends, have fun and all, best waste of time game that you end up just unrewarded for your time that you spent on it.The PVE content and all the promises that were broken and cancelled the whole actual meaningful content that was going to justify the ""2"", 3-4 years of no content with the excuse of ""we are working on Overwatch 2, to bring you more pve content"" we now know why Jeff quit the developing team, because the whole pve content was cancelled and hashed into this current worthless update called invasion which felt like just a revamp of the Archives event.It genuinely deserve to be rated Negative and not recommended and I hope Blizzard would realize that and really start working on making the game an enjoyable game instead of simply trying grab everyone wallet for half baked skins.And yes I played this game since 2016, I logged in, got literally all 164 achievement."

Brandinio,1,August 13,56,,19,Not Recommended,"TL;DR - Activision Blizzard execs are making terrible decisions for this game therefore I will not recommend this game. Steam reviews are the first proper way that players can express their opinions, so keep the negative reviews coming.---The main question is, would I recommend this game? The answer to that is simply ""No"".Why you may ask? It's because of the absolute terrible decisions made by the higher ups at Activision Blizzard that is causing this game to become a sinking ship. Everything from the monetisation of the game, to the ""cancellation"" of the PvE, to them splitting the original campaign into bitesized chunks and charge you for it in an attempt to squeeze more of your hard-earned money out of you in the long term. I mean, why release the entire campaign in one go for like $50 when we could just release them in 5-6 different chunks and charge you $15 each for it, right? Activision have been known to be money first, player experience second. I mean just take a look at their Call of Duty library on Steam. 10 year old games still going for retail price. Battle Passes, paid for character unlocks, skins, you name it. Disgusting. And now they want Overwatch to head in the same direction.But other games have similar monetisation models? Sure. The issue here is that Overwatch 1, did not have this model to begin with. We were told that ""Overwatch 1 players would be able to play with Overwatch 2 players"". They made it seem like we could just stick with the game that we already paid for, Overwatch 1, and still be able to get the new heroes and maps from OW2, and play against players in OW2. That did not happen. Switching to a free-to-play model and then forcing all of your player base to go with the new model is just damn right disgusting.Are the developers to blame here? Me personally, I don't think the devs of the game are to blame. I think they just want to make a good game. But they're being forced to create this awful experience because they're being told to by the higher ups at the company. It is rumoured that this is the exact reason as to why Jeff Kaplan left the company. It's more than likely also the reason why most of the amazing talented development team have left the company too. If you look back at the team a couple of years ago to now, it's basically a completely different team. I wonder why that is...Why is there over 100,000 negative reviews, surely this is unfair??? I've seen a lot of people, mainly content creators, that are saying this is unfair to ""review bomb"" the game. I completely disagree. You've got to understand that in the past, there wasn't really a proper way to express our frustration about this game and the direction it was heading. Sure, you have Reddit, the OW forums, Twitter, but the higher ups / stakeholders can easily bury their heads in the sand and pretend that all this negative feedback doesn't exist. Whereas now, the Steam reviews are front and center on the game's product page. Something that they simply cannot ignore. That's why this is happening. To make a statement to Activision Blizzard. To let them know, that we hate where this game is heading."

Now it's a cash shop in which you pay the air you're breathing, even the pve missions that were promised once. The monetization system is beyond pitiful and the game is incredibly stingy with rewards. Activision Blizzard thinks they can get away with milking whales but whales aren't gonna help you when servers are empty because you treated all your existing player base like cash cows giving little to nothing in return. I guess they need to check fornite's model again because they somehow failed trying to copy it. Don't expect a single penny from me until you fix this trash system and give players real incentives to be invested."
Shpongoloid,33,August 10,92,9,0,Recommended,"5,000-hour player here.Here are some things you new Steam players should be aware of:- Monetization is disgusting. If you're new to the game, don't buy anything. 20 euro skins are just cosmetics, they will not make your hero better.- Quick Play is chill but matchmaking is unbalanced and every match has tons of leavers.- Competitive is a bit of a joke and shouldn't be taken seriously. Everyone's ranks are super inflated. I made a smurf account and after going 5-0 in my first 5 matches playing only Rein, I was immediately placed in Grandmaster 3. I don't know how that's even possible.Despite all of its problems and things not having been the same since Jeff left, I still love the core gameplay experience. The heroes, the maps, the modes. That core gameplay is what still makes me play Overwatch, and there's no other game like it out there."

Thanks Blizzard.Edit: Might as well put my comment in the review as well:I honestly loved Overwatch 1, even though I didn't pay a single penny other than the base game price, I was able to get every single collectible for every hero. I kept playing even in the content draught era but then they made this abomination called Overwatch 2 with lots of (false, it turns out) promises. They took our beloved game and forced us to play this instead, which even to this day has tons of missing features and is ridden with bugs of all kinds. OW1 had the Blizzard polish on its every crevice but OW2 has no sign of it. Blizzard has become a shadow of what it used to be in the past few years and I solemnly hate it."
Leckie,1,August 11,50,,39,Not Recommended,"Overwatch was so good back then 6 years ago. What happened? Blizzard became greedy and one of the most disgusting and incompetent company in videogame industry.Micro/Macrotransactions - I'm sorry but paying $20 for single skin is such scummy behaviour. People that bought the game before didn't get basically anything (no veteran status, nothing). You can get a skin for playing, but it will take you a lot of weeks to earn coins through weekly challenges. We hated lootboxes but it's was the golden era in this mess. And forget about those coins from one of the worst implemented battlepasses I've ever seen.Toxic community - you can say this is not the game's fault but with constant balance changes and shadow fixes, skills become inconsistent and sometimes buggy, most of us players don't know what to expect. People swearing and being mean in chat when you may not have your best day and then immediately report you for you being toxic, following your account being silenced is just trash. Oh and when you're silenced and cannot chat, you get reported too for not cooperating with the team :) visious circle. How toxic? Well I decided to go to voice chat, guy was threating to go to my house and R word my girlfriend. Family friendly community indeed. But of course Blizzard won't do anything about that.But I was patient, the new PVE mode was about to be released (after numerous delays) with character and abilty progression. That was the main reason they put the 2 after Overwatch. Guess what - first, they scratched it all and instead released PVE small missions (3) for $15. And no this is not a ""license to play PVE"", this is only for first 3 missions. The audacity is immeasurable. It's obvious Blizzard has not a clue what they're doing. Not to mention company's accusations about sexual harrasment (with evidence and even a suicide because of it). The only good thing about the game is... maybe the graphics, which is highly subjective.

Kyyndle,5,August 11,80,,0,Not Recommended,"DISCLAIMER: This is a copy-paste of my Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review I posted back in April 2023, which is also an Activision Blizzard game. This copy-pasted review is 100% relevant for Overwatch 2. I don't feel like spending hours on a new review when so many problems are the same, but I do want to spread awareness on EOMM. This is what Activision Blizzard games are now, and it will not change. I currently have >500 hours on Overwatch 1, and <100 hours in Overwatch 2. ---We're all aware of Skill-Based Matchmaking (SBMM). ...but have you ever heard of Engagement-Optimized Matchmaking (EOMM)? That's what MW2022 Overwatch 2 uses.Ever feel like one day you're on a roll, but the next day you can't win a single game? There's a reason for that.Here's one quote from Activision's EOMM patent they renewed in 2019 (source[patents.google.com]):Originally posted by Activision Patent US10857468B2:     ...responsive to a determination that the first player purchased the in-game item, the player profile may be updated to reflect the purchase and the first player may be matched to play a second gameplay session in which the in-game item is suitable to be used.    For example, if the in-game item is a weapon (e.g., an accurate and powerful sniper rifle), the second gameplay session may be selected because the weapon is highly effective in the second gameplay session. Doing so may encourage the first player to make subsequent purchases due to the satisfaction of effectively using the in-game item during the second gameplay session.TL;DR: Microtransactions directly influence matchmaking, rather than skill. Not enough? Here's Activison's argument for why EOMM was necessary over SBMM:Originally posted by Activision Patent US10857468B2: Conventional systems further fail to leverage matchmaking processes in other contexts, such as influencing game-related purchases, suggesting group formations, training/identifying non-player characters, and/or otherwise extending the use of the matchmaking process. These and other drawbacks exist with current matchmaking processes utilized in multiplayer video games.This game is manipulating you. It doesn't care about how good you are. It doesn't care how much fun you have. It cares about your money, and Activision is willing to ruin your lobbies to get it. The only way to win this game is to not play at all. In this case, the house always wins."

Overwatch 1 was fantastic, this on the other hand feels like a cash grab. Balance is getting worse and worse, the for years promised PVE mode with Talent trees etc got scrapped (or rather they now sell an inferior version of it in small packages, thus make more money out of it than if they would have sold it all in one). You even have to unlock new heroes now on the Battlepass. This makes no sense in a game where you're supposed to change heroes to counter the enemy."

huu,0,August 10,44,,0,Not Recommended,"Overwatch 2...I'll be the first one to say - I haven't played much Overwatch 2. This is more-so a recap of my time with Overwatch 1, why I stopped playing it, and why I never came back, even with the release of Overwatch 2.Let's wind the clock back to 2017. I was getting very bored of Team Fortress 2 by that point. The ""Meet Your Match"" update, which likely released to try to compete with Overwatch, had killed the way I was used to playing the game for about 4 years at that point, ruining the experience by making it feel more ""competitive"" rather than a fun, casual, silly game to mess around in. By that point, I was craving something new.Most of my friends had gone to Overwatch, so I started to want to play the game. Sometime in March 2017, Blizzard hosted a free weekend for Overwatch, which is when I made my account and tried the game. Surprisingly - I enjoyed it. So much so that I started to want to play it, but problem is - I was an 18 year old without a job struggling to finish school. So I couldn't afford it. One of my friends at the time caught wind of this and gifted me a copy of Overwatch (thank you, by the way, Hitzip). I really appreciated this, and started playing, and at that time - firmly left TF2 behind.When I got into the game proper in May 2017, I was having a blast. I enjoyed the fact that, despite being more competitive than what I was used to with TF2, a lot of the skills I had from that game transferred over. I wasn't the best, but I was having a fun time. Being a Medic main in TF2 meant that I found my home with Mercy. Yes, I was a Mercy main, before the Mercy rework at that. There were a lot of things I genuinely enjoyed about Overwatch when it came out. The Sombra ARG, the Doomfist arc of piecing him together and even wondering if Doomfist will ever be a playable character. I was around for all of it, and following along both with YouTubers & Reddit, solving these cryptic mysteries, piecing it all together - it all reminded me of, well, Team Fortress 2. And its old updates, like Love & War and the bread stuff that came with it.When I first got into Overwatch back in 2017, it felt like I was part of a growing, accepting community. Jeff Kaplan's videos addressing the state of the game & ways they're taking to improve things was also a breath of fresh air compared to what I was used to with Valve, who would often just sit silent and do nothing, even to this very day. Legit, it was very exciting to play & be a part of the community by then.However, I bounced out of Overwatch in early 2018, last playing sometime in 2019 before giving up on Overwatch as a whole. And mainly because they started doing mass-reworks of, what felt like, every single character. First came the Mercy rework, which sucked for me as a Mercy main, but I could understand the logic behind it. She was stupidly easy to play and was ludicrously effective with her ultimate being a CTRL+Z keybind put into gameplay. But then came Symmetra, Torbjorn, the nerfs to Roadhog & Junkrat...it all became too much. I felt like I had to re-learn and re-adapt to what felt like every old character being tossed out and replaced with new ones everey 2 or so weeks. It became exhausting to keep up, so I tapped out.Over the years, I saw Overwatch going in decline. Player numbers dropping. Allegations against Activision-Blizzard. Overwatch League dying - this one particularly stung, as I knew a friend of mine who was actually part of OWL and he basically lost a career out of it - and Overwatch being left in a vegetative state. All for Overwatch 2.Come announcement of Overwatch 2. I'm sure you know by know. Overwatch 2 was originally meant to be a single player campaign game, where Overwatch 1 would be, well, Overwatch's PvP. Content from OW2 would get ported back to OW1, and the two games would co-exist.The idea was:- OW1 for PvP- OW2 for PvE campaign stuffThis never happened. Instead, Overwatch 1 was effectively killed off and replaced by Overwatch 2. PvP, now instead of 6v6 is 5v5, much like CS:GO & Valorant. Loot boxes have been removed, which, at first glance - awesome! Loot boxes are a tumor in modern gaming, regardless of what company is doing it - be it Blizzard, EA, Valve - I viewed it as a positive that Blizzard was removing the loot box system, and thought they'd replace it with something better, like what Valve did for Dota 2.Nope. Battle Pass. Two versions of it. Basic one, which gives you ♥♥♥♥-all, and a Premium one, which even has stuff like outright brand new characters. Ones that players who do not pay for it - DO NOT GET TO PLAY AS. One of the core selling points of the original Overwatch is that you buy it, and all future content - maps, events, characters - are FREE. Overwatch 2 ditches this by going free-to-play and opting for a Battle Pass system.There are other things that drove me away from Overwatch in 2018 as well - role queues in particular just made it feel unwelcoming to play. But what drives me away from revisiting Overwatch with OW2 is the monetization model, the convoluted leveling system which feels like they're trying to reinvent the wheel for no reason, and many issues from Overwatch 1 not being addressed.Ironically enough, I've fallen back in love with Team Fortress 2 since then. And that's probably the game I'm going to continue playing, even 11 years later. I don't see myself having the same attention span for Overwatch 2.What a shame, really."

Bocchi from Bocchi the Rock!,0,August 11,37,30,10,Not Recommended,"D.va is the most attractive character in all of Overwatch. Nothing or no one will convince me otherwise. While you middle aged buffoons hopelessly stroke your microscopic slabs of meat to overrated, tasteless sluts like Mercy or Mei, I thoroughly and triumphantly pleasure my beautiful South Korean goddess each and every night. Being not only the youngest hero, but single-handedly and easily the best in the entire roster, D.va is the pinnacle of human achievement. The first thing uncultured, pitiful swines who call themselves ""men"" often tend to notice in a woman, is her breast size. While D.va's cup size is rather smaller than the flabby chest tumors of the other female characters, this trait only adds more to her captivating feminine charm. If you want to be a fool and cast your judgement on merely looks, even still you will notice that D.va completely obliterates any competition whatsoever. With her slender body, lovely hazel eyes and well-conditioned medium long hair, you simply cannot ask for any more from a woman. If an idiot male hadn't coveted D.va's beauty, he is most likely attempting to bash my fair maiden for her characteristics. To that, I say their opinions are completely childish, as they are merely jealous of her countless feats of victory. As you already know, D.va is one of the world's greatest Starcraft players of all time, already proving that she is in possession of incredible precision, reflexes, and to top it off, a master tactician. Anyone upset by D.va's charismatic and boisterous personality should expect to be ridiculed, as my empress has worked very hard and diligently to achieve this pompous state of living. And your tears only fuel her ever-growing success even more. So really, I ask of you a very simple question. What can you say about yourself? Are you the popular designated pilot of a specialized South Korean war machine? Do you possess unmatched beauty that no other girl can ever come close to achieving? Are you being paid to participate in the war against the Omnics and reject soldiers? No? I thought so.﻿"

CornGolden,0,August 11,22,,3,Not Recommended,"It still feels so weird seeing this game on here.Personally I don't hate Overwatch. I've been a TF2 fanboy since 2010. When OW1 was released I celebrated its innovations in the realm of team based shooters, and what ideas it could give a game like TF2 in the future. Wasn't a fan of its lootboxes, and relatively sweaty community, but from what I saw the game looked fun and its community was strong and loyal to it like TF2s (I will admit tho OW beats TF2 in its porn by a landslide). Unfortunately, its unnecessary sequel, OW2, Is a game I can't give much praise to.This game:- Features a battlepass that locks new heroes behind a massive grindfest. If you want them immediately you gotta cough up around $10 for them.- An item shop with outrageously overpriced items. A lot of which are around $15-$20. As much as I personally love D.Va (my fav pornstar) I aint shoveling out $10-$15 to play as  her in a cop outfit, or a school uniform.- Different types of in-game currencies. There's your premium currency ""Overwatch Coins"" that require real money to get (not obtainable via battlepass btw), and your lesser currency ""Legacy Credits"" obtained either from the battlepass or from leftover credits carried over from the old Overwatch. Premium gets you fancy looking skins while lesser gets you reskins of the base skins for each hero.- On the topic of Overwatch Coins not being obtainable via the battlepass why can't OW2 grant you premium currency through it??? Other games with battlepasses (Fortnite, Apex, Warzone) grant you around 1500 of whatever their premium currency is as you progress through their BPs. Hell if you save those, their even enough to get you the next BP without having to spend more money for currency for another BP- Makes you miss lootboxes as a microtransaction mechanic. A sentence I never thought I'd ever say along with ""Overwatch is now on Steam.""-A PvE (THE WHOLE REASON WHY OW2 EXISTS IN THE FIRST PLACE) that was cancelled in May, then resurrected as this $15 paywall per story mission campaign?!?!?- On top of all this, OW2 is a game ""developed"" by Blizzard. The same company that is currently trying to implement another unnecessary BP in Diablo IV, and had one of the most predatory microtransaction systems with Diablo Immoral last year. On the upside, I can now play this game without needing to use the god awful battle.net launcher (thanks Microsoft! Once Warzone Caldera shuts down I can uninstall that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ software at last!). Plus I can run it on my steam deck now without having to do a bunch of tedious steps to get the game to not crash like before (recommend Proton Experimental for this or your controls wont work after you die once)Do I recommend you play this? Sure. It's fun, but VERY flawedDo I recommend you spend any money on this? ♥♥♥♥ no. Don't encourage Blizzard to do ♥♥♥♥ like this in the future. Save your money, and spend it on a better game that deserves your money like Baldurs Gate 3 or Elden RingIs OW2 porn better than the game? Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Y E S!!!At least the porn doesn't ask you to empty your wallet left and right.Overwatch 2 and Blizzard: they ♥♥♥♥ you harder than all the generic 3D dudes that porked down Tracer, D.Va, Widowmaker, and Mercy COMBINED!"

Nagato Komado,7,August 10,88,2,0,Not Recommended,"I used to love Overwatch, and in a way, I still do. However, Blizzard decided to turn Overwatch 2 into yet another soulless free-to-play game with a battle pass, microtransactions at exorbitant prices, and, of course, the removal of free lootboxes. This forces people to grind their way through the battle pass levels to earn some of those legacy coins. Not to mention the removal of key features from OW1, only to be re-added (some of them) later in OW2.And worst of all, they removed the PVE game mode. Like, what the heck? Cancel the only reason this sequel had the ""2"" in its name? They knew they'd never finish the PVE mode when it was released in October last year, yet they hid this from the public for half a year. Some people actually bought their skins, believing it would help further the development of the PVE mode. Instead, we get this wasted potential of a story mission, WHICH COSTS 15$. THEY'RE NOT EVEN GIVING IT FOR FREE. We could've had a full game with multiple story missions, skill trees, hero levels, and much more.Overwatch 1 died for absolutely nothing. Blizzard only killed it so they could rebrand it ""as something new,"" but in reality, it's just the same game with a lot more microtransactions."

Daar,0,August 13,45,,16,Not Recommended,"Overwatch one used to be a game i'd play after coming home from school, or until late hours into the night when i was younger. When i heard that they were going to make an overwatch 2, i wasn't particularly interested, because i was planning on continuing to play 1. Because of this i was devastated to find out 1 was basically paved over. My dad paid 60 bucks for the original, as well as skins he thought that i would like. overwatch 1 comforted me on nights where i thought i wasn't going to wake up in the morning, on nights where i thought my lie was never going to get better, as well as nights where i thought i was doing alright in life. the fact is, overwatch 2 is beyond disappointing in comparison to 1. you could get skins and whatnot just by playing, and not having to purchase loot boxes. you could if you wanted, but it was not required. overwatch 2 promised pve, and failed to deliver. the match making is utter garbage, and the community of the original overwatch look like saints in comparison to overwatch 2's community. it's sickening how my favorite comfort game became this disgusting cesspool of toxicity and money hungry bastards."

Underdrill,0,August 11,17,,1,Not Recommended,"Like many of you reading these reviews, I was once a huge fan of Overwatch. I had the Origins Edition preorder and was there at midnight on release day, loading into Hanamura and signing away my gaming life for the next year at minimum. From the incredibly fun cast of characters, to the great map design, to the instantly iconic music and sound design, to the consistently rewarding (albeit somewhat controversial) progression system, it quickly became one of my favourite multiplayer games ever made. If it was released on Steam in 2016, it would easily be in the top 5 most played games on my account. I eventually moved on as I grew tired of the competitive grind, but became super excited to return with the announcement of the sequel offering substantial PvE content.And then the sequel finally dropped last year…and they dropped the ball with it. Jeff Kaplan clearly jumped ship for a reason.The promised story campaign, endlessly replayable PvE missions, and talent trees for each character, were all pretty much cancelled in their entirety, with the community informed far too late in the process. The single main reason for this game having a 2 slapped onto it in the first place will no longer come to fruition, so what’s the reason for it being called Overwatch 2? Outside of the new 5v5 standard, and the typical live-service hero, map and mode additions, the core of Overwatch is essentially the same as what was originally released all those years ago. I guess there is some PvE content in this invasion update, but the main part of it is locked behind a £13 paywall, and there’ll probably be more £13 segments of this campaign locked behind future paywalls. With so many incredible titles out there still to play, I cannot foresee myself dropping the cash to experience what is essentially a fraction of a campaign that games less than this cost of entry would provide in full and then some. Why would I spend money on this when I could buy incredible experiences like Skyrim, Doom Eternal, Papers Please, Disco Elysium and Mafia for far less?Outside of sports releases, Call of Duty and Ubisoft games, sequels to beloved titles usually come with substantial additions and advancements building on the foundation of that original entry. It is an insult to the legitimate sequels out there that this is still being referred to as a second entry in a franchise. The only substantial change I can see relates to how the game handles progression and monetization, and this is a straight-up downgrade from how it was handled in Overwatch 1. It has become yet another F2P live service where the most exciting content comes in a time-limited Battle Pass, where all items are unlocked in a linear fashion and require a substantial time investment to make the most of your purchase. This exhausting, creatively bankrupt trend is disintegrating the interest that many people have in modern AAA shooters, as it turns every game that has one from being a fun past time into essentially a secondary job. Blizzard even had the audacity to lock the latest heroes past the halfway point of the free battle pass track (changed to Unlock 1 if you pay up), meaning everyone will not have access to the full hero roster at all times, a truly fatal error in a game where a good portion of the strategy is based around hero synergy and effective counter-picks. All of this pains me to write, as the game still remains incredibly fun to play all these years later. The foundation of Overwatch is brilliant, even if not much has changed. But I just cannot excuse how shamefully Blizzard has handled this “sequel” to one of the most revered multiplayer shooters of the 2010s. I know it’s popular to refer to Overwatch as one of the many in the line of dead live service titles, but I don’t think it deserves that placement yet. Games have come back from far worse states than what Overwatch 2 is currently in. I hope Blizzard is having a serious chat behind the scenes, looking at the fan backlash received over the past few months, in particular with this Steam release, to see what needs to be done to make things right. They can only rely on the support of fans with a high sunk-cost fallacy and new players oblivious to the game’s previous greatness for so long.I’ll return to Overwatch to try out some of the seasonal modes I’ve missed, but outside of that, Blizzard won’t be getting a dime out of me, and not much time out of me until they at least make the PvE a competent experience, as was promised when Overwatch 2 was first announced. I hope that my perception towards this game will become more positive over time, but Blizzard has a lot of work to do to make that happen."

While you few idiots clearly don't mind being lied to and scammed and that's fine, it your right to be a fakking moron if it makes you happy.But the reality is Activision Blizzard is nothing more now than a company of liars and scammers who' greed has become such that that they even shut down the OW1 servers even though we paid 60$ for it.....to force people into playing literally the EXACT SAME GAME *nothing new, nothing any different* except for the fact now that they have monetized everything in the game that you used to be able to get from just playing and enjoying the game.Why do you think it's on Steam now??? Lol it's because the player base is dwindling and they are desperately looking anywhere they can for suckers to play the game in hopes that if they enjoy or play the game enough they will give in and fork over more and more money to the company time and time again because now they have no other choice.If you want to play a class / team based shooter that is fun, still has plenty of player base, and isn't monetized in every possible way they can think of or get away with AND is also F2P then go download Teamfortress2 it's a better more fun and more balanced game anyway."

They didn't do it so it makes it easier to play with friends. Or if you don't have your battle.net app installed. Or whatever reason.They just added Overwatch on steam just because it is bleeding players. Why else would they put a free to play game on steam? The worst part? It's self inflicted too. They ruined the game I and many players enjoyed and blizzard could do the right thing, but they would rather die on this hill, or more specifically, the own hole they dug.All the player feedback is useless. Their philosophy is ""we know what you want better than you do""Another reason this game is here is because of blizzard's continued strugglers and underperformance. Battle.net houses some of the fastest and best selling PC titles of all times. If there existed a single developer that didn't need steam, it was blizzard.So this is just an attempt to secure more players for a game that is in decline.

Zache,0,August 11,63,2,1,Not Recommended,"I remember seeing the Overwatch 2 announcement trailer three years ago and even if I had lost all interest for Overwatch at that point, I still was a little interested for the game because Blizzard really announced Overwatch 2 to be a completely different game with the PvE. Later when the game actually was released I realized how this is an exact copy of the first game expect somehow worse, this game is NOTHING else but a money grab for Blizzard. Loot boxes are no longer free, any skins in the games will cost you real money where some of the prices for one single skin is selling for 20 dollars. There are even heroes in the game that are locked behind a battle pass that you only can obtain by spending real money, this is ridiculous and deserves to stay as the lowest rated game on Steam."
JTodd,20,August 11,42,4,21,Recommended,"Edited my review to put this quick summary at the top:Overwatch 2 is not a game without faults. I think a player should evaluate what's important to them and decide themselves if they like the game and wish to spend time with it, like anything else they do in their life. In my opinion, the actual gameplay in Overwatch 2 today is the most fun the franchise has been in a very long time. The game is free, and all Heroes and maps are playable without spending any money. If you are picking up the game today, know that the game is best experienced with friends.----Prefacing this by saying I, personally, never really cared about the PvE campaign. I was probably going to play it at some point, but what I mostly play the game for is the PvP, which I find very fun, so PvE not being rolled out the way it was promised has no impact on my opinion of the game we have today. It's very important to note that, for a very large number of people, the promises made were a make or break situation. I acknowledge that this is a legitimate reason to dislike the game. There is still a PvE campaign-ish thing in the game as of Season 6, it just simply is not what people expected. Final side note on this, the PvE was always planned and advertised as a paid experience, I am not sure how people ended up thinking it was going to be free.The handling of the professional Overwatch scene was very poor and also impacts a lot of people's opinion of the game. Overwatch can be a difficult game to watch, so combining that with bad management is unfortunate (but also has no bearing on the actual gameplay). I wish Blizzard had let the grassroots competitive scene grow naturally, instead of creating the mess of OWL.---I am a peak Masters player in standard competitive, so I have an OK idea of the game state, but I'm not a particularly amazing player, especially since I just play ranked occasionally now and squat in Gold and Platinum depending on role(washed up).-Overwatch is a fun and colorful hero shooter in an interesting futuristic universe with goofy likeable characters that allows for a lot of skill expression for people with different play styles and skill sets. Team fights are dynamic, chaotic, fun, and frequent - nearly constant. The average time-to-kill in this game is quite long compared to traditional shooters, which is my personal preference. Every role has significant impact on the outcome of the game, however, not every Hero has the capability to win the game on their own.I particularly like the amount of characters with high mobility options in the game, which is a deterrent for some people due to the increased emphasis on mechanical skill, I just find it fun! There are Heroes that don't require good aim and there are Heroes that don't require fast reflexes and keypresses. Most important, currently every Hero in the game is a viable option - despite what your teammates may say (But team play is still more important than Hero viability). There are mains for every hero in Top 500 in every region, which somewhat, imperfectly, proves my point.The transition to becoming a F2P Live Service game was a good move overall, in my opinion. The additional cash flow should incentivize more frequent updates and balance changes, and so far has done exactly that.The price point for skins is in line with other F2P games, which means they are quite expensive. The seasonal battlepasses have improved and are now about average, or slightly below, compared to other games in terms of content. There is a ton of filler that no one wants, but the large milestone premium rewards are pretty cool, which seems standard. For comparing, Fortnite still stands above most of the industry.A complaint I have with the new economy is that the seasonal battlepasses so far have not had currency in them to pay for future battlepasses, which is a practice many games with passes have. Placing Heroes in the battlepass, also, was a move I, and many others, did not like. Note, they are on the free pass, rather than the paid pass, and all of the Heroes are available through free missions after their debut season has passed.There are weekly quests for battlepass experience that also have a premium currency reward for their completion, but the amount you earn is so minuscule it might as well not be there. What is most important about the change to a F2P environment, is that every map and every Hero is available to a brand new player without spending any money whatsoever.To extend on this thought though, I think that with how this game is played, all Heroes should be immediately unlocked for all players after their onboarding because of the importance of Hero-swapping. A player starting the game today is at a legitimate disadvantage because of their limited Hero pool, until they finish unlocking them all. If the game were even more MOBA-like and did not have Hero swapping (like Paladins) then this system could be slightly more acceptable. As it stands, in my opinion, this is the biggest reason to not pick up the game if you don't plan to play long term. It is not P2W, but it certainly is not a direction I like, despite it not affecting me personally.The online community for this game, both inside of the game and out of it, is like every other online game - extremely toxic. There are bubbles of pleasant and nice people, but you usually have to seek them out. I met my closest IRL friends in a random match of this game, so I know there are nice people who play the game. My recommendation, unfortunately, unless you are high rank and playing Competitive, is to not join voice chat and disable text chat if you have a sensitive disposition. On the plus side, I report people constantly, and constantly receive notifications that the people I reported have been actioned on. Press the button liberally.-Other things about the game:The Workshop is a powerful tool that has a dedicated community of players and creators keeping it fun and interesting. There are tons of fan-created modes and tons of people playing.The Arcade is quite fun and silly (depending on rotation), but is unfortunately not incredibly popular. Sometimes, a particularly fun mode rolls through and has extremely fast queues. Mystery Heroes and Deathmatch are other alternative ways to play the game, which I find relaxing, especially compared to Competitive. Ever since Blizzard nerfed Tanks in non-role-lock queues, these modes have been much more enjoyable.The Achievement system in this game is a particular soft spot for me. I am a completionist and love achievement hunting. This game is actually quite good for people like me. A downside, is many achievements are only available during specific seasonal events, so you may have to wait a long time for them if you are starting today. Tangentially related, there are Co-op event modes with scoring and leaderboards that are really fun to optimize with friends.Competitive is the central (but not most popular) mode in the game. In my opinion, there is not enough incentive to try to climb the ranked ladder, unless you are aiming to go pro. I own many golden guns, and what I gain out of Competitive is just more golden guns. Needs improvement. The temporary Competitive modes that Blizzard comes up with (like Mystery Heroes and Lúcioball) are always super fun to me, but have very long queues due to being unpopular.Last thing I can think of is Co-op Vs AI matches. I have no experience here, but, like in LoL, apparently the mode is quite popular. Could be a nice alternative if playing against people is stressful.--Conclusion: There is definitely good and bad that you need to weigh yourself. For me, I really like this game, I find it very fun, so I will continue to play. My opinion, whether you're new or experienced, is the best way to enjoy this game, coming from a former competitive-only player, is grab a beer, get a group of friends together, queue Quick Play/Arcade/Workshop, and just goof around."
[unassigned],0,August 12,62,,1,Not Recommended,"Let's get this out of the way first: I negatively reviewed Overwatch 2 and I also negatively reviewed TF2. I have no dog in that fight, I think TF2 is a cesspit of racists, hackers, and bots, and though I once enjoyed my time on it, I got tired of games lasting hours and then getting decimated by something like a c@ bot.But people also have every right to hate Overwatch 2, especially if they (like me) used to play Overwatch 1. Most games when they get a sequel continue to exist even after that sequel is released. Not so with Overwatch 2. It completely overwrote Overwatch, so none of us who paid for the game get to play it any more, instead we got Overwatch 2. Allow me to explain a few reasons why this screwed us over:Team SizesDespite looking really no different, and functioning basically the same (minus a few character changes), the fact that they dropped teams from 6 to 5 massively changed how it played in practice. One tank meant a single player underperforming as a tank crippled the entire team. Before, the other tank could pick up the slack, but not now. Especially now they have so many ""DPS"" tanks, there's too many occasions where you or your opponent desperately need a shield to even the odds but the lone tank won't comply.Not to mention is made fights much quicker. The tank can't defend everyone, so if the enemy wipes the healers with a flank while the tank's struggling to cover the front, it's pretty much over for that fight. Before, you could have a dedicated tank for your heals or damaage and another to hold the frontline, so fights took longer and required more skill and strategy to separate the team.SkinsNow, I'm not part of the zoomer generation that thinks it's acceptable to pay for skins (and I don't begrudge you thinking that, it's all about what you're used to and if that's what you're used to then it's not your fault, I just don't have the same view). I grew up playing games where skins were something you modded yourself and were as varied as you liked, with entire communities dedicated to making interesting designs. The idea of having to pay for them, or even buying from other players (while a company takes a percentage of it as well) is insane to me. So I NEVER buy skins.Blizzard didn't like that from people like me. In Overwatch, you used to be able to earn skins in-game just through playing, and they were viable enough that I'd collected maybe 60 or 70% of them before Overwatch closed. But in Overwatch 2, that's dead and gone. There was a running joke among players that after a few months, it would finally be getting to the point where those of us who were grinding every day and every week would finally have enough in-game currency to buy ONE skin. That massive nerf to earning skins meant Blizzard was intentionally forcing people to pay real money (£10+) for a clothing change.It's pure greed from Blizzard, and probably the main reason they stole Overwatch from us, to try to funnel everyone into the new game for more attempts as selling pixels to us. And it works, I regularly see people saying they're saving up to buy the new skin. I've seen my own younger family members buying things like virtual currency for Roblox and other such nonsense, so it's just the way things are now, but when it impacts what we've already paid for then there's an issue.CharactersInitially, the changes they made to characters wasn't particularly useful. Orisa losing a shield to become a more DPS-oriented tank still bugs me, and Doomfist going from DPS to DPS-oriented tank was also a massive mistake. But they were just symptoms of later issues.The new characters they've made have mostly followed this sort of pattern, where they might be a tank or a healer, but ultimately they've been designed to be doing more damage again. Which leads to the inevitable result of players neglecting their primary role to focus entirely on the damage aspect which Blizzard gave them, pushing the entire game further into these rapid, chaotic, ADHD battles all the time.And why do they have to keep pushing the overly progressive nonsense? Why does what a character apparently does in the privacy of their bedroom matter in an FPS that's primarily aimed at kids? There's no need to go ""oh btw this one's not straight!!1!"", as if it matters at all in that context. The more you draw attention to it as being weird in your eyes, the more it makes people feel uncomfortable.MapsWe lost a few maps that some disliked because of the game mode (assault maps), but I personally enjoyed. Hanamura, for example, was one of my favourite maps. I liked Horizon Lunar Colony. I get that others didn't, but to remove them from the list entirely was irritating. Why they couldn't do a TF2 style ""select which maps you want to queue for"" system, I have no idea.The new ones were even worse. Any of the ""push the robot"" maps are awful, taking way too long for an obvious outcome solely because the spawn proximity to the end is what's stopping the game ending in many cases. The back and forth of it is also extremely boring, having to fight your way slowly all the way up only to have to do it again and again because you're taking it in turns to wipe each other.But then it got so much worse. These new Flashpoint maps are insanely bad. You now have to capture not 1, not 2, but 3 points to win. I've seen matches where the teams are so even that you both end up double 99% on every damn point, and it took 5 whole points before the game ended, meaning you're fighting the equivalent of 10 dominant games for a single win, 2.5 times the length of a usual king of the hill match.Story modeI never had any hope for this. I didn't play Overwatch for it, and I knew they'd be bad even if they did turn up. You can get better content from Custom games, as is common for most multiplayer games. It was never going to be something as in-depth as maybe a Call of Duty story mode, for example.But it really has been an insult to those who have been waiting for it. We already had a taste of what was to come with those special event maps and game-modes, usually at Halloween with the Junkenstein stuff, it's always just players fighting NPCs like pretty much any other usual multiplayer map against people. In fact, the current new one is just a copy of the previous King's Row Uprising game mode from Overwatch. That's all that got given to people who (perhaps naively) thought they'd get something of worth.Blizzard is selling these multiple times as season passes, for a game that a lot of us had already bought once before. They're asking for regularly payments at the level of a brand new game for effectively cosmetic trash and recycled or bland content. To me, it feels like disrespect to their players.Ultimately, I used this thread to vent, but also to make an important point for a lot of the flamers drawn out in defence of this game: don't let your ego get tied up in something that's not connected to you. When people hate a game, they can hate it without knowing you even exist. It's not a personal attack against you specifically. In fact, you can let people hate a game and the company that makes it without it having anything to do with you. Focus instead on what you enjoy about the game instead of trying to tear other people down for their opinions. I'm glad you can enjoy Overwatch 2, but do bear in mind that there's a lot of people who unfortunately can't do that, so instead of reacting with hostility to them, maybe empathise with how they might be feeling."

With updates over the years, the development team has systemically destroyed everything I like about the game. Every character I liked playing, reworked totally. Goofy stuff like stacking heroes, gone. Even in casual modes. Further shrinking of the already small team sizes to 5v5. The developers seem to take the game more seriously than it has any right to be. Even the lootboxes, already my largest complaint about the first game, replaced by an even more predatory monetization model. I wish I could go back and play Overwatch 1. But you can't anymore. Overwatch 2 has replaced Overwatch 1 - the existence of Overwatch 2 is a net negative, and it would have been better if it never happened. This game has no reason to exist, and I'll never get to play the game I loved ever again.This is to say nothing about the horrific abuse taking place at Activision Blizzard.

Overwatch 2 looks better than Overwatch 1, so there is that too I guess.I've played Overwatch 1 and some Overwatch 2 over on bnet - it's probably still a somewhat decent game but the almost predatory microtransactions are worse than the lootboxes in Overwatch 1; yes it's free 2 play, yes the devs need to earn money to keep the game going but please be more creative than a battlepass (that used to not give you back any premium currency for the first two seasons!), locking new heroes behind a paywall and underwhelming PvE missions that leave a sour taste in your mouth when you think about what it could have been.But hey, Bobby needs a new yacht so more microtransactions are expected to pop up soon!"

Starliqht,0,August 10,151,36,220,Not Recommended,"AHAHAHAHA I HAVE WAITED FOR THIS EXACT MOMENT. I WAITED ALMOST MY ENTIRE OW LIFE FOR THIS GAME FOR THIS TO BE ON STEAM AND NOW THAT IT IS, I CAN FINALLY LET THE WORLD KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS GAME. IT SUX SUX SUX AND IT MAKES MY BRAIN GO AHHHHHHHHHLet me explain, I played this game around 2017 when the game was ""good"". I recently came from Minecraft when I felt that the game that I loved wasn't the game that I initially fell in love with (Déjà vu) and I immdiately fell in love. Great game at the time, fun times and memories yada yada yada you get the picture. Genji main who stuck in low ranks, wanting to be the very best after seeing a certain Genji youtuber (you know the one) slices and ults the entire team. Thankfully that dream died a long time ago along with a box of other broken dreams but still, having fun playing a training mode for Exp and fun (I paid my $60) & eventually meeting some good friends. I instead found a new goal of wanting to work at my profile and wanting the max border possible but you don't want to hear about it. What made me change my mind? The sheer obvious balance changes that the community couldn't agree on. New chars (Doomfist was the first added hero they added when I played) while I don't personally hate them, all genuinely have a problem. Moira is a great example. My friend who optimizes Moira (shoutout to T.C.) explained to me one day why Moira is a throw pick technically around higher ranks because she doesn't have any utility other than damage or heal while Ana has sleep, nade, and boost Mercy, has rez, etc but at lower ranks, can easily dominate because people don't know how to counter her. It amazes me how rushed and unrefined most of these heroes are, but they just care about the OWL... as yes the OWL... The Overwatch League is a league where Blizzard tried so hard to make a success. A league filled with people who don't have an idea how to run a proper league. I will say, when the OWL was on Twitch, everything was so simple. Moving to YouTube and having to watch with your bnet or watching now with a YouTube account specifically linked to your bnet and you can't have a business Google account and have to have a specific Google account makes it complicated to watch and earn points, I would rather buy a skin that I like (if I wanted too, not that I have any skins that I like that I don't own). I never really had any desire to watch people better than me compete for something because...Well, I stopped caring. There are plenty of videos of sweaty men in one room focusing on hard work, showing teamwork, and being rewarded when they finish I have seen in my days *ahem* The part that I don't enjoy is the fact that Blizzard seemed to have forgotten the 98% of the player base with content, and of course balancing... Anyone can tell you that GOATS was the most annoying team to face, and if you didn't mirror it, you'd get rolled over. The devs who had no clue how to balance this just kept buffing DPS and nerfing the Tanks affected but it was still there. No matter how hard Blizzard tried to nerf (in once in a blue moon), the meta was still there and the only option was for them to add Role Q.Role queue was in my opinion one of, if not the least most controversial update. Some people liked it because you HAD to play with Tanks and healers, no more than 6 DPS (sad), and some people hated it because dps queue times. I hate it with a burning passion because of how streamlined the game is. Let me rephrase, the way they implemented it is the way I hated it. I could have possibly gotten used to it, but they just added it as a last-ditch effort to make the game watchable for the OWL. They could have reworked some DPS into tanks and support, and balanced some heroes that obviously could have benefited from it, but no. So much for creativity! It also made Comp too more annoying if someone who cares about getting the maximum comp points in a game has to play a role they aren't comfortable and you're at a disadvantage. Another thing is splitting the ranks into individual roles, at least the way they implemented it was horrible also because you can have someone Top 500 in their main role, and Bronze in the other 2 roles as a joke (nice one). After so many seasons of the same thing, there is no purpose to playing comp or keeping grinding once you've done it all. I mean sure you can aim for the leaderboard, & have a cool spray and icon, but... after that, what's the point? There is no reward or motivation for someone to keep playing comp other than lackluster rewards and some comp points, but nothing meaningful. Despite all of this, what kept me going and playing during these dark and troubled times was leveling my border and aiming for that max diamond border because, to me, that felt like an accomplishment. Finally aiming for something you've been working hard. I didn't care about Sr or glory/fame from smarter people, I cared about leveling my border so that people in the game can go, ""WOW this person played a lot, they're so dedicated"" or ""I hate facing you, you're the final boss of OW"" and after even hitting my goal I wasn't done yet. During that time when there was NO CONTENT after 2020 and NOTHING TO DO, I started to hate the stale of it, waking up every day playing a dull game that but despite all of this, I was still under the impression that when OW2 would come out, the borders would continue and that I leveled 600..no 1,200 levels(totaling my time to 6k hours today) after 3001 thinking that there would be some cool border. Even though that early on, they announced borders would be gone that I would still be awarded for my work. I had every obtainable loot boxed skin with an extra 300k ow credits saved up thinking that I would use these for OW2. I was filled with hope and determination that Ow 2 would bring my love back for this game. Yeah, that was a lie and it was all for nothing :) Ow 2 was prob the worst thing that Blizzard has ever done with this game and I even miss the GOAT era days, heck I miss the no-content days bc that was more fun than the horrible shell of a game that exists today. My skin collection will never be complete now because I am 2 poor to afford these horrible excuses for a skin price, and since FOMO is a tactic, will prob never appear again (unless in the shop in 2099). My border which I worked so hard for, was reduced to only being seen in your career profile with no way to progress it, replaced by some horrible Battle pass grinding which itself is also stupid & frustrating to grind. I used to look forward to recycled events and look forward to doing my chores of ""winning 9 games for an epic skin"", but now, I don't even care. Everything that I've cared for is gone for the sake of ""convenience"". The little things like I can't type when loading or bugs that should not have been a thing day 1 (on fire being not there until recently) should not have been a thing. But the shop magically always works! This new hero progression is not the same thing as Borders it's in my opinion a lot worst because the ""reason"" Borders were gone was ""players of high level were being bullied for playing too much and being in x rank"" or something like that when I think hero progression is going to do the same thing, if not worst, especially with an off-meta character, and of course how could I forget the broken promise of PVE :) Unfortunately, every time I load up this game, the song of Viva la Vida and a wave of depression would hit me making me question my purpose in life and make me suffer a midlife crisis. Every time I genuinely play the game, I suffer the 6 stages of grief while in queue and in the hero selection screen.TLDR: Sop Story don't try this game. I wouldn't recommend this game to my worst enemy, although they probably still love this game like the mindless drone they are lel."

Zeptimus,0,August 10,46,2,4,Not Recommended,"Wow, the audacity of Blizzard to bring this game to steam.They really must be getting desperate for mone- ermh, I mean, players.For those that are completely unaware, the short summary of what has happened, excluding all the other Blizzard scandals and flops, is that the original Overwatch was put on life support after they announced that OW2 was coming, with the main focus being PvE for the sequel. Fast forward, they finally released OW2, except there was no promised PvE and it was just Overwatch 1 with cut features, a balance update, a paid battle pass and pretty much removing the ability to earn skins by playing.  They basically took away the product that people had paid for previously and filled it with a cash shop. They did also show a roadmap that hinted that the PvE will be coming after a few seasons. Okay that's not the worst, right? Give players the updated PvP early to build hype for PvE that's coming soon. Well, they didn't hold up to their release date promises and delayed the PvE further with no confirmed released date. The community was left in the dark and let down yet again. Now in recent months they came forward and said that they're giving up on the original promises of vastly replayable PvE mode with a progression and customization system and will instead release story missions spread out, bit by bit. Missions that most likely are glorified versions of PvE event missions from the original Overwatch, which are no longer available due to the release of OW2. They even dared to say that they're doing all of this to focus on what ""players really want"", which apparently is ongoing support for PvP.So they want you to pay money for butchered PvE that will probably take a bit over an hour to finish.  I don't think I'll go on more about all the other little details that have happened during the lifespan of OW2, but let's just say that the balancing team is still incompetent and the game now has a predatory monetization system.The recent Diablo 4 release was also terrible, clearly all of their talent has left the company long ago. I've also heard that WoW and Hearthstone are having increasing monetization features.So in summary, Activision Blizzard is probably the scummiest gaming company and it doesn't deserve your money or leeway from criticism. Overwatch being a victim of their greed and now just a shadow of it's former self.Bobby Kotick is probably going to cry into his dollar bills about how he is the victim again and that everyone else is wrong."

м,1,August 12,23,,10,Not Recommended,"I hadn't played Overwatch before and when I saw it here on Steam, I wanted to give it a try.Well, I can't really say anything about the game related drama going on, don't really care either, but what I can say is that I'm already bored after just 10 hours.It's not completely bad, but it feels out of time.Graphics remind me a bit of Borderlands. That was a great game, but we got 2023, so a game shouldn't look like it came straight from a dated mobile phone.Animations look pretty poor as well.The menus also remind me of some low budget mobile games. Bling everywhere and most of the stuff is hidden behind a paywall.There are different gamemodes and a lot of different maps, but I only really liked 2 or 3, the rest feld generic and boring.I'd like to play some decent PVE modes like the MvM mode in TF2, but except for 1 map, that's also hidden behind a paywall.I bought the cheapest hero package to try some of them out, but tbh, to me it feels like at least 1/3 of the available heroes are essentially useless or underpowered compared to the other ones.In some game modes I also had problems finding other players. Sometimes you wait 2-4 minutes and nothing happens. For a ""new"" release that's a bad sign, and also makes me impatient enough to go to play  something else instead. For a short while it's okay, but I really don't understand why anyone would play this for dozens or even hundreds of hours. There are far better games available.  Overall, well it's F2P, so you can always see for yourself, but personally i think that this is a boring and generic, perhaps overhyped game from the past, that also looks like a game from the past.Poor animations and low quality graphics, mixed with paywalls everywhere. No thank you."
Brotos,0,August 11,54,,1,Not Recommended,"SummaryRun like hellOverwatch 1 to Overwatch 2The main reasoning for Overwatch 1 being shutdown and Overwatch 2 replacing it was for its PVE and story content. For me personally, I don't care about this content. However, this was the pretense that Blizzard gave for shuttering the previous game. To no ones surprise, Blizzard simply relaunched Overwatch with battle passes and other money grubbing systems at the core of it. The CORE, which was the PVE and story, does not exist.All the Bad- Adding Battle Pass- Battle Pass has no currency rewards, and your'e unable to re-purchase the pass via playing for long hours (They are deviating from the standard way of the battlepass)- Deceptive Battle Pass Currency: They then added currency, after much complaint from the community. BUT they added a separate currency that can't be used for the battle pass anyways. ON TOP OF THAT: The currency you can use to buy the battle pass is GOLD. The currency they give you in the pass is supposed to be SILVER. However, in the battle pass, they color the silver one as gold to trick people into buying the battle pass.- Removed all loot boxes in exchange for in-game currency that does not match the value. Goodbye any seasonal or rare boxes!- New heroes that are locked behind obnoxious achievements. These are meant to force players to keep playing in order to pad Blizzard's abysmal player playtime stats.- Matchmaking is absolute garbage, expect a one-sided game, every game- Ranking system drops your ranks completely after each season and you have to win them all back. Because you have to start from the bottom, many newer or low ranked players are having to play top ranked players.- New skins that are paid for have no love behind them. They're absolute junk that have been pumped out quickly and not even worth the purchase."
Sontron,0,August 12,41,,6,Not Recommended,"It’s a good thing that this game is getting review bombed. At first I thought it would kill it even more, but I soon realized that it is an outlet for community frustration and a true way we can voice our grievances in a way Blizzard can’t ignore. No, it most likely won’t incite change into Overwatch’s death snowball, but if it doesn’t then the reviews accurately reflect the attitude of a community that just wants their fun, engaging, somewhat balanced, and much less greedy game back more than anything. I believe I speak for most of the community when I say I would much rather revert back to the latest stage of OW1 than play this corporate wasteland of a game. So, Activision Blizzard. We’re not mad. We’re just disappointed.Sincerely with despair,Your real player base"
Raiden,2,August 16,18,2,0,Not Recommended,"If y'all wanna know how to make the juiciest most delicious chicken breast, here's what you do. Take a tupperware container and put water and salt in it, take boneless skinless chicken breasts and put them into the water and let it soak at room temp for about an hour, that salt water will get absorbed into the chicken and season it inside and out. Once it's soaked long enough, take it out and season it however you like, at the time I just used Montreal steak seasoning. Put that in an air fryer at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for about 15-20 minutes, flipping once at the middle of the cook time. Pull that chicken out when it's done and your face will be absolutely soaked when you're done eating. In the same vein, if you want a super delicious steak, pull it out of the packaging and pat it dry with a paper towel and dust the outside of it with Kosher Salt. Put that steak back in the fridge and let it sit a couple hours, preferably overnight. Once you're done, let the steak sit on the counter so it can warm up a bit before cooking to help get a better crust, then preheat a cast iron to ripping hot, at least a 7 on most stoves (and turn off your smoke detector). Put a little bit of vegetable oil in your pan and put the steak down. Only cook a minute or so each side until you get the crust you like, then turn the heat down and cook til you get your desired doneness, I like a good medium myself. The way that overtime, the salt will draw the moisture from the steak, season it, and get reabsorbed into the meat leaves it with a flavor I have never tasted before in my life, and likely won't in any other context. Give these a try and comment how it went, if you improve on these, let me know what you did better"

K3W3L,0,August 12,12,,18,Not Recommended,"Kinda wild to be a part of gaming history playing Steam's newest worst-rated game. Apart from the gameplay (I will vigorously defend the 5v5 pivot and Push mode) it's sad to see the game sink to these depths. Godawful monetisation, new heroes stuck behind battle passes, battle pass implementation itself (no coins from battle pass tiers but just credits? How stingy can they get?) and the original promise with which OW2 was initially pitched - a full-fledged PvE mode which I was sorely looking forward to given my exhaustion with the PvP aspect - all but broken.If you're willing to overlook the negative aspects you'll have some fun for a while. The gameplay still feels great! It's an unbelievably fast FPS compared to almost everything else. It's just a shame that Activision Blizzard has completely sunk in the years since OW1's release, paralleling the downturn that would happen here."

月影流觞,4,August 11,34,3,20,Not Recommended,"作为一个热爱游戏的玩家，我不得不在这里表达我对《守望先锋2》这款游戏的严重失望和差评。这款游戏无疑是我在Steam平台上的一次最糟糕的购买体验，以下是我对这款游戏的详细批评：首先，游戏在技术方面存在严重问题。我在游玩过程中屡次遭遇了崩溃、卡顿和连接问题，这极大地影响了游戏的流畅性和可玩性。作为一款面向多人游戏的竞技射击，稳定的服务器和流畅的游戏体验是至关重要的，然而《守望先锋2》在这方面做得实在太差劲了。其次，游戏的内容匮乏令人失望。与其前作相比，《守望先锋2》几乎没有带来任何创新和突破，新英雄和地图的数量少得可怜，而且它们的设计也毫无亮点可言。这导致游戏很快就陷入了单调和乏味，没有足够的内容来吸引玩家长时间投入。另外，游戏的社区和玩家之间的互动几乎为零。开发者似乎对于玩家的反馈和建议置若罔闻，导致许多存在的问题得不到解决。这种缺乏沟通和互动的态度让玩家感到被忽视和冷落，进一步削弱了对游戏的兴趣和支持。总之，我对《守望先锋2》的差评无法用言语来表达我的失望和愤怒。这款游戏在技术问题、内容创新以及与玩家的互动方面表现极为糟糕，完全不值得花费时间和金钱。我诚挚地希望游戏开发方能够认真反思并采取As an avid gamer, I feel compelled to express my profound disappointment and utter disdain for Overwatch 2, a game that I had the misfortune of purchasing on the Steam platform. This game has undoubtedly provided me with one of the most abysmal gaming experiences on Steam, and I have outlined the extensive reasons for my negative critique below:First and foremost, the game suffers from severe technical issues. Throughout my gameplay sessions, I encountered a myriad of crashes, stutters, and connectivity problems that severely hindered the fluidity and overall playability of the game. For a multiplayer competitive shooter, stable servers and smooth gameplay are paramount, yet Overwatch 2 fails spectacularly in delivering on these fronts.Furthermore, the game's lackluster content is deeply disappointing. In comparison to its predecessor, Overwatch 2 brings virtually no innovation or advancement to the table. The meager number of new heroes and maps are utterly devoid of any notable design elements. This quickly results in the game becoming monotonous and tiresome, lacking the necessary content to engage players over an extended period.Additionally, the interaction between the game's community and its developers is practically non-existent. It appears that the developers have turned a blind eye to player feedback and suggestions, resulting in a plethora of lingering issues left unresolved. This dearth of communication and engagement leaves players feeling neglected and dismissed, further eroding any interest or support for the game.In summary, my scathing review of Overwatch 2 cannot adequately convey the depth of my disappointment and frustration. This game's abysmal performance in technical aspects, lack of content innovation, and absence of meaningful player interaction render it utterly unworthy of both time and money. I sincerely hope that the game's developers will earnestly reflect on these criticisms and take proactive steps to rectify the game's myriad shortcomings; otherwise, Overwatch 2 will forever remain a woeful footnote in my gaming history."

Happy,0,August 14,38,,0,Not Recommended,"This review is only to tell you all that one day they will resurrect OW1 and re-release it as a paid Vanilla game (aka WoW). Do not give them money until then, because OW1 is leagues better than this mess will ever be.As of right now I have 2,309 hours played. As someone who has been with Blizzard since childhood and played most of their IP's, Overwatch was the one that I loved most. The heroes and the lore spoke to me, captured my imagination, and made me inspired by the beautiful world they created. Jeff was our canary in the mine - once he left it was a sign that the game I once loved so much was simply no more. As everyone else has stated, OW2 is a zombie parading around in the skin of a game that had so much potential, but due to catastrophic greed was twisted and mutilated to the point of being unrecognizable to those who have been with it from the start. On top of having no LFG system in a team-based game, charging money for story modes (which is a shell of the PvE experience that was promised so many years ago) is just one more slap in the face for those of us who still wanted to give OW2 a chance. Play for free, there's still a lot of fun that can be had, but do not give them any of your money."

Dennis Delav,0,August 11,23,,36,Not Recommended,"This game is text-book definition of corporate greed. -Overpriced skins-Locking new heroes behind a pay wall or a grind (battlefront 2 anyone?)-Filling half of all already overpriced bundles and battlepasses with fluff nobody wants-the battlepass has no way to pay itself back (partly or fully) like most other gamesAnd all of this I could have forgiven IF the pve that they added was free but they didn't. They've just released 3 parts of the pve story and it's a standard bundle of €15.Besides all that, the reason why I still play it is because there's no other game like this, people might suggest paladins or team fortress 2, while they're fun they're still too different imo."
fretz16,0,August 12,43,2,0,Not Recommended,"Used to be my favorite game because it had (and, quite honestly, still has) a very addictive gameplay loop. Those close-call matches used to be so exhilarating.  But so many aspects of the games are just so frustrating now that even those thrilling moments aren't worth the hassle. It's more than just the battle pass and overpriced skins. There are so many unbalanced heroes (Hanzo, Bastion, Ramattra, Mei and some others are just horrible to have to play against).  It used to be so much fun to just jump into quick play, even if I was playing solo - now everyone is just mean to each other in the chat. Not sure if it will ever go back to what it was before, but I don't recommend playing it right now."
Acetone,5,August 11,27,2,0,Not Recommended,"The game is free but so are most sins, until it comes time to pay and the account within our souls is indebted with guilt and doubt.I often thought about coming back to this and Heroes of the Storm, but then I remembered that every second Blizzard exists is another abused coworker, every dollar spent on their products is more money for some creep's legal defence, and every thing someone playing the game says is scrutinised by people who are on board with each totalitarian idea humanity ever invented.After years of constant lies, non-apologies, condescension toward the customer, questionable monetisation schemes and EULA's claiming more of a stake within your conscience than your local vicar, I don't know how gamers still allow them to even exist, let alone make more gambling simulators.Blizzard is evil, it needs to shut down its doors forever."

raspy,2,August 11,16,,33,Not Recommended,"I can't in the right mind recommend anyone play or even try Overwatch 2.The sole reason that Blizzard released a second game and advertised the game around -- the PvE with progression systems to provide replay value -- was ultimately scrapped. Sure, they eventually released some missions, but it seems like it will be a pay-as-you-go system for missions likely of questionable quality given how the game has been handled so far. This left us with a poorly balanced husk of a game, released only to enforce a new monetization scheme that is so predatory and unfair to players' time that players ended up preferring the previous system of loot boxes.The claim that the new game brought a ""new look"" with a ""new engine"" are entirely false; Overwatch 1 was removed from BattleNET store to hide that Overwatch 2 is the exact same game, on the exact same engine; so much so that for multiple weeks after it's release, it was recognized by SEVERAL applications e.g. Windows Control Panel, NVidia GEForce Experience, and Discord as the exact same game as Overwatch 1. The inclusion of changing environmental settings within maps and claiming it's in any way new technology is laughable; Garry's Mod has had entities to change the position of the sun in the skybox, alongside sky and fog design, which would also dynamically change the maps' lighting -- since before Overwatch 1's original TEASER TRAILER RELEASED. A forum post of players asking how to use these dates back to February 2 of 2014 -- the teaser was November 7.Unlocking the shiny new heroes is locked behind a battle pass, deep enough in that it could take a couple weeks to unlock them. Alternatively cough up $10 and receive a single hero immediately. In the case of multiple heroes released such as Junker Queen, Sojourn, and Kiriko -- who have all been essential picks since their inception, topping pick rates in most elo ratings (especially higher) due to the versatility and power of their kit -- this means you either spend weeks lulling behind other players or choking up the $10 per character to be able to play the competitive mode viably.Even if you don't care for the competitive modes, the almost non-existent gameplay style gap between the competitive mode and all other gamemodes -- including any of the modes in Arcade -- results in all casual modes eventually becoming filled with players who want to play to win but are either unhappy with their performance in the competitive mode or want to avoid the stigma behind it, often making even casual play a toxic slog.There are no deeper mechanics to learn aside from aim and gamesense, which all first person shooters demand regardless. Even the most difficult heroes have kits that can easily be described in a couple sentences per ability maximum. The most intricate details possible are specific interactions between various abilities -- but those aren't mechanics to improve your skill upon, those are knowledge checks that are one-and-done, easily learnable and digestible within seconds.--Contrast this with FOUR similar games (2 FPS and 2 traditional MOBAs):FPS:Paladins:- Has deeper mechanics to tinker and learn with talents, card decks, and progressive item purchases within matches- Competitive mode doesn't allow players to swap character mid-match, making character picks more meaningful- Competitive mode also features a ban phase commonly found in literally all other competitively viable gamesTeam Fortress 2:- Has deeper mechanics to practice and master with blast jumping, surfing, and air strafing- Bustling community scene with a functional server browser and well-documented modding tools- Community-supported competitive scene is still alive and well to this dayTraditional MOBAs:- Items, progressive power increase, strategic downtime, macro play- Competitive and casual modes feature ban phases- Characters are locked past pick phaseDOTA 2:- All characters are free! Wow! Crazy!- Powerful items allow clever purchases to turn the tide of a bad game- Mostly unit-cast abilities and items makes effective ranges consistent to play around and more fair- Slow pace shifts focus more towards macro (gamesense and strategy) playLeague of Legends:- Massive roster supports a wide range of playstyles- Runes, summoner spells, items, and interactions all within grants tinkering power- Mostly missile-based abilities grants skill expression through the pushing of character limits- Fast pace shifts focus more towards micro (mechanics and execution) playAnd would you believe, all of these games are free too?Don't waste your disk space or time, Overwatch 2 doesn't respect it."

They took a game we paid for, deleted it, and put out a greedy pay to win whaling simulator in its stead.Save a whale, press + under reviews and add a Microtransactions tag!Most reviewers have hundreds of hours on battle.net so don't let the hours played fool you. Check their achievements and you'll see that many of them have dozens of achievements."
Dubbz,1,August 13,30,,5,Not Recommended,"Sad. I have 500+ hours on OW1, but I can no longer enjoy that game because they forced everybody to play OW2. What are the differences between OW1 and 2? Other than the obligatory new characters and maps to keep a live service... alive... is a shop with overpriced skins. The monetization in this game is predatory. It is exactly like mobile app pricing, where you get very little for a ton of money. OW1 cost 60$, which would likely get you 3-4 skins in this game. If you spent 60$ in OW1, you could get toolboxes that would come with tons of skins and other items. Blizzard doesn't NEED toolboxes to monetize their game, but it needs to be worth it to the customer or NOBODY will want to buy them, and you just get bad press surrounding it. I understand people like toolboxes because they were free and easy to get, and I understand why Blizzard cant do that anymore. Nobody ever had a reason to buy them because you got so many just for playing. But the current price of skins is awful. The fact that new characters are locked behind a battle pass, OR require you to WIN 30+ games to unlock is absurd. If a player were to return, they would have to play a ton of games with old characters just to even try the new one. This prohibits new players from learning the new character, and thus they will struggle to fight against them. Apex has a much better system, where you can unlock character credits over time. That way you can play whoever you want, win with whoever you want, and stock them up for future updates. It would give players a sense of progression, while also rewarding people for playing more than others. The BIGGEST letdown is the news of the PVE. Easily. You can see from my profile I love doing the achievements in this game, and that includes the PVE missions. Even IF you're going to take away everything you promised, you couldn't even add extra goals for the leftovers of your PVE ideas. There is no achievements for doing it at harder levels, and there's no replay ability. I understand that you need to charge people for the PVE since this game is free, but it just isn't worth 15$. You can watch the cut scenes online which is arguably the best part, and that's free. Knowing blizzard, they will find a way to cease and desist users for posting them online eventually just to try and get people to buy it. I believe here's what happened. Blizzard is in the middle of scandals involving Hong Kong and it's hasty banning of pro players. The drama was bad press, so you released a trailer for OW2 to try and get people hyped in a game that hadn't received updates in years. Before we could even process the hype, Blizzard executives told developers the promises were too much, and it wasn't going to happen. Jeff left as a result, and upper management couldn't decide how to tell people it wasn't going to happen. So they promised and promised and promised, until eventually they had to tell everybody. Why did they take so long to tell people it was canceled? Because they didn't want to kill the game before it started, so they waited till the game was off the ground after the beta released to break the news. Last year in 2022, they release the game as a ""beta"", even though it was basically just a rushed version of OW 1.5. It was in ""beta"" for months, and absolutely none of the feedback was taken and used. People weren't happy about losing level portraits, people weren't happy about losing the ""on fire"" feature, and many others. None of this feedback was taken during the beta, and instead we were pushed towards a battle pass and a new skin shop. The battle pass is full of filler. This isn't new to anybody and I don't want to dwell on it. It takes way too much time to get all the rewards. As far as I understand, if you don't max out the battle pass you DON'T get all the rewards. This means you pay for it, and may not get to utilize all of it. Other games do this but it doesn't make it right. If I buy the battle pass, I should be able to keep it for future seasons and fill it out over time. I should NOT be motivated to play the game by fear of missing out. This game is not being respected by Bobby Kotick. He needs to go. These reviews are deserved. Give people the game you promised, or STOP making promises. This game is a perfect example of false advertising. For those of you looking for good a shooter, go play Apex legends. That game can be played completely free and you still get the most out of your experience. The team actually responds to people on twitter, and they take your feedback. They give you what they promise every time. There is nothing redeeming about this game. If you're brand new to Overwatch, it is nearly impossible to learn from scratch at this point anyway. Play something else. This series is going nowhere."

"Sunset, the Local Catgirl",0,August 13,29,,48,Not Recommended,"tldr: Paladins is better, if you're spending money, put it there so Hi-Rez sees the game is growing again and will allocate resources to its improvement. As it stands, Overwatch is digging the same grave it's been in since...well, forever.Overwatch 2 is...quite the tale. A game with fantastic promise, which would go on to be realized to a relatively small audience by a competing game, being slowly buried in its ever growing hole of problems by its developers and their higher-ups. And I feel the need to emphasize the ""and"" there. A lot of long-standing problems for this game, ones that predate any PvE announcements, are BALANCE ISSUES. TTK is really awkward in this game. Either you can't do any damage through the supports' healing, or you're either functionally or literally one-shotting opponents. No, there is not an in between in team fights. Also, DPS has no reason to exist in the game's current state, and we've seen this remain the case for years. Their damage is only slightly above the output of tanks and supports, and this has been the case since launch. Actually, it used to be even worse, before one of the first blanket non-answer solutions was implemented; a bunch of DPS buffs, then when it didn't work, the addition of Role Queue. Role Queue exists because the balance team couldn't be bothered to do their job, plain and simple.Prior to balance changes that affected the flow of the game at the launch of 2, gameplay could feel unimpactful as a lone player. Not as in ""I can't 1v6 carry"", but you'd encounter frequent situations where you were definitively having an impact, but it rarely FELT like you were. The answer to unsatisfying gameplay, and the answer to the metas in the second half of pre-2 Overwatch, was NOT to remove a tank. The entire role is designed around having two tanks, and we've seen what a fustercluck tank balance has been in 2. It's an absolute nightmare. Half of the tanks fundamentally don't work solo, and are either unplayable or broken at any given time. Oh, and the removal of a tank is another example of the balance team simply taking an easy way out instead of balancing the game people are already playing.Nearly every hero has at least one insanely frustrating element to them. Heroes feel like they're designed and balanced without ANY consideration for how being on the receiving end of their kits is going to impact the experience, and while of course that shouldn't be the primary factor, it shouldn't be a nonfactor either. Kiriko's Suzu is a band-aid solution to a host of balance oddities that needs to exist and yet shouldn't exist at the same time. Baptiste's Immortality Field is a literal ultimate on a relatively short cooldown, and one non-ultimate can swing a team fight around due to the quick TTK in this game. Sombra's invisibility and hack are an incredibly annoying combo to play against, paired witht he fact that a half decent one can just teleport away and never be punished. Widowmaker and Hanzo shouldn't be able to one-tap so many heroes, especially with Widow being a hitscan. I understand that the removal of their one-shots in the game's current state would likely kill them, but if they need to be unhealthy to be viable, then either they should be destroyed or the game should come down to a level they can work at. The game's not polished. Now, I do acknowledge that Paladins isn't either despite me saying it's a better alternative, but Paladins is made by a significantly smaller company. The quality of the game dropped significantly, with SEVERAL new bugs popping up at the release of 2 that can ruin the experience. Ultimates can be silent, your health bar can remain full after getting hit (causing you to believe you have more health than you do), and so on. This stuff has to be adressed, and unlike Paladins, Blizzard has no excuses.PvE. Sure, what we have gotten of it is fun so far, but it's a hollow shell of the game we were promised, that required killing Overwatch for such a long time to develop. It's probably worth the money, but not moreso than other games, and definitely not worth the time it took to arrive.Oh, and I did also forget when writing this review initially, but the skins in this game SUCK. There are a few decent ones, but other games with similar ideas of what ""skins"" are charge less for higher quality skins. $20 for a recolor is insane. $5 for a recolor is insane. The fact there are maybe 50 unique voice lines across EVERY skin is ridiculous with how expensive they are. No, silhouette recognition isn't the issue, nobody has that problem in Paladins, League, Smite, hell Siege lets you wear a PIZZA HAT or ply as RICK AND MORTY skins, and people know just fine who it is."

Rarigon,0,August 14,21,,0,Not Recommended,"I have been playing Overwatch ever since the Beta came out. You know a game and company is a special kind of special when you make your fan base wish they had the old Overwatch and Loot Boxes back. Before i start listen well, all of the blame does not fall to the Developer Team im sure they played a role but they were absolutely forced by upper management, the share holders and executives to make these predatory changes to the micro-transations in the game today. Do not attack the Dev's.THE GOOD:Let me get into the good before the bad. Story and game play are amazing. the Developer team has limitless opportunities when it comes to the lore and story, being able to take the narrative in any direction. The addition of new Heroes is the driving force of this game. the game has that tight polish and uniqueness to it that you wont find anywhere else with Paladins being one of the only similar games to Overwatch. you will enjoy this game as long as you do not play Competitive or spend money really.THE BAD: Broken promises, greed, and rushing content out the door is absolutely putting this game in the ground. $20+ for a legendary skin a name card/ spray and a souvenir (which literally no one wants or uses) are you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ joking?? The Battle Passes are horribly bad, locking new heroes behind them to entice you to pry open your wallet just so you can get a potentially key game play element that was free a few years ago. You can grind for the new hero and get it for free in the pass but your talking potentially hours and hours of grinding levels. The Battle Pass often has a ton of random items and skins to pad it out instead of actually including all the skins that are from the current event and sticking with a themed battle pass and Invasion is no different, the exact same formula. instead they try to sell you these select skins separately and push FOMO on you to get you to empty your wallet. Wouldnt be surprised if Blizzard put old Mythic Skins on sale for $40 or $50 later down the line. Probably the most insulting of all is the fact the now broken promises of PVE were scrapped now they are putting those said missions behind a pay wall for $15 for an hour's worth of gameplay and cutscenes. these missions are boring, base tier at best akin to the quality of the overwatch archives events years ago. Go watch the story and lore on youtube do not give Blizzard your money for these missions.I love this game i really do but i cannot recommend it at all in its current state and management. Its really fun especially with friends but if your gonna play, play for free.DO NOT. waste your money on this ♥♥♥♥, Blizzard management does not care all they want is your money."

Onemuri,1,August 14,9,,1,Not Recommended,"Играю я в Овервотч с бета тестирования оного еще в 2016 году. И как человек, который прожил с этой игрой столько времени, я не могу порекомендовать игру в нынешем её состоянии одновременно вспоминая какой она была и во что её превратили. Я любила OW1 всем сердцем очень долго, убивалась по лору и персонажам, гриндила рейт, ждала и верила в развитие игры, смотрела киберспортивные события. Но увы OW1 был задушен отсуствием быстрого обновления меты и контента, и все ради обещаний разработки нового контента для OW2.В итоге OW2 вышел и ничего собственно не изменилось. Якобы игру перевели на новый движок, 6vs6 поменялось на 5vs5, добавили новый режим, и несколько карт, при этом полностью убрали 2cp карты и режим (то есть шило на мыло поменяли).Новый режим с толканием робота очень плох, каждый раз когда я на него попадаю, мне хочется удалить игру. Карты для этого режима тоже очень сомнительне, особенно Коллизей. Новые герои, которые выходят, либо выходят очень перебафаными (Кирико), либо абсолютно ненужными (Лайфвивер). Потом их очень долго пытаются довести до кондиции, как будто героев и баланс никто не тестирует во время разработки. Но самое плохое в OW2 это её монетизация. По факту у меня забрали OW1 под шумок мелких изменений (где хоть как-то можно было получать шапки поднимая уровень), врубили ф2п и вместе с ним просто абсолютно чудовищный донат. 20 долларов за пак с скином. 10 доллларов за батлпасс, где 80% конента ненужный мусор. Они отменили PvE составляющую игры, которую мы ждали ГОДЫ, чтобы разбить ее на несколько миссий, которые проходятся за полтора часа и продают их за 15 долларов. Самое смешное, что магазин забит скинами прошлых лет, которые я к счастью выбивала бесплатно, и теперь их продают в тридорога. И теперь если ты хочешь косметику, то либо покупай в магазине, либо покупай батлпасс, либо гринди вторую внутреигровую валюту (но ты не сможешь за нее купить некоторые скины). До 6 сезона в игре вообще отсуствовала какая-то прогрессия кроме циферок ранкеда (про циферки ранкеда вообще отдельная тема, насколько плохо сделана система и насколько она непонятна для обычного игрока). Было ощущение, что в этой игре день Сурка. А про то что разрабы вынули фичи типа ""On fire"", чтобы их потом вернуть с гордостью, ну просто смех. Я, конечно, не исключаю, что игроку новому, который не знал OW в его прайме, в целом игра норм, но если честно для себя я ее уже давно похоронила, с огромным сожалением."
flatpancakesss,0,August 11,11,,0,Not Recommended,"I've been a long time fan of Overwatch since I bought it in October 2016, this ""sequel"" ruined my love of the game. Blizzard have turned a game that was once really fun and good into a predatory free-to-play live service game, not to mention the whole mess that is the PvE aspect of the game.Skins that were once available for free just buy playing the game are now sold at prices higher than I paid for the original game in 2016Implementation of the Battle Pass model turns the game into a grindfest where you have to play the game for many hours within a short time just to earn the cosmetics that you paid for, otherwise they're gone forever with no way to obtain themAs of the time I am writing this review, heroes are locked behind the Battle Pass forcing you to either pay for them or grind a lot of hours just to unlock them. This has a negative impact on the game as it hurts the fundamental design of Overwatch where counterpicking enemy heroes is a large aspect of the gameLastly, the entire situation with Overwatch 2's PvE is a story too long to be told within this Steam review, and I'm sure you know the story already. Well the PvE has finally released and its 15 US Dollars (I think? my currency is different) for only 3 missions that are roughly an hour and a half long in total. While the story itself is good and so are the cutscenes, this price is terrible for the amount of content you truly receive on purchase.For the price of the Battle Pass, PvE, Item Store skins or other cosmetics in this game, there are plenty of other wonderful games that you can find on Steam / other platforms for a a similar price. I highly recommend you check out some other games instead of this."

Kyxlect,0,August 11,30,,0,Not Recommended,"I have 485 hours in Overwatch 2 and received all of the achievements I earned from launching the game via steam. I have not played OW2 since Blizzard announced they were no longer going to deliver on the original vision promised to the community. This upgrade was the entire reason behind Overwatch 2's entire existence, however it's been made painfully clear that the only purpose behind the change was to turn Overwatch into a live service game with egregious amounts of monetization.The main issue with this is that in Blizzard fashion, they shut down the original Overwatch, which was a paid game, for this. Then somehow managed to make the worst and most greedy monetization system in the business. In Overwatch the only monetization was loot boxes and despite the fact that they contained a lot of worthless filler no one wanted, the system was at least generous by giving the player a loot box for just playing where you could also receive coins to buy whatever you really wanted if you got duplicates and despite how much everyone hated loot boxes, they hate this new system even more.In Overwatch 2, there's a battlepass with no earnable premium currency for both free and premium passes like every other game out there with a battlepass system. You can 'earn' a small sliver of the premium currency by playing the game and doing challenges but it's a fixed amount and again, very small, it would take months to unlock anything through that method. They do give you ""Legacy Coins"" which can be used to purchase cosmetics from Overwatch but no new ones. The amount you get is not really generous either and they raised the cost of cosmetics by an obscene amount. It is in no way shape or form a good deal to buy premium currency for these skins which cost $20 each so your only decent option to get cosmetics is via the battlepass but the problem there is you're just earning the exact same thing everyone else is. These cosmetics also seem to be Blizzards number one priority and some turn out horrendously ugly. They churn them out quickly for every new battlepass.There are three roles in the game: Tank, DPS, and Support.Most people play DPS, then Tank, then Support. Tanks are bullet sponges that do less damage as one would expect, Supports are a little too strong in my opinion and being that it's the least popular role, most of the people that do play Support focus more on getting kills like a DPS than healing because they wanted to play DPS and even though they're the only ones that can consistently heal others. DPS does feel a bit underwhelming, like they don't do as much damage as you'd expect and can be overwhelmed by Supports due to their own damage output and abilities, Tanks too obviously.Now onto the gameplay experience, it's mostly frustrating. Overwatch pretty much always has been about appealing to the more competitive playerbase and while the original development team dragged their feet when it came to balance, the new team is just unbelievably incompetent and have no idea what they're doing. That's coming from someone that derives enjoyment from playing to win so I myself have a competitive mindset. In Overwatch, my favorite characters were Mei and Sombra because they were the most fun characters to play. In Overwatch 2 they nerfed the most entertaining part of Mei and made her boring and they've already slated Sombra to be nerfed in the same way. But do they balance the character that in my opinion is the most broken one and has been since the original game, being Junkrat? Nope.Competitive mode is not enjoyable, if you're solo you'll likely be abused by your teammates who are in groups or squads and if you call them out for it they'll probably just straight up throw the whole game. Also due to squads existing, many players perform poorly because they're boosted from playing in a squad so they're not at the level for the Rank they're playing in and you can only have two in a squad in the higher Ranks. They don't like it if you play certain characters and they'll let you know, even if they have no idea how to play the character themselves. Very toxic. Some are likely to be smurfs as well. OW2 does have a league for esports but I believe they're going to be shutting it down, probably because it's not profitable enough and the company's surrounded by controversy.The new characters they introduce will likely be broken as in overpowered so the battlepass will sell more. Yes, new characters are locked behind the battlepass system. If you don't unlock the character before the battlepass ends you can 'earn' the character by completing some challenges.There are also events during holidays like Christmas, Halloween, Summer, Chinese new year, etc. but they do feel a bit underwhelming, the challenges take too long are not very fun to complete, the 'new' event gameplay is not fun to play and the rewards are usually lackluster. They do recycle old content as well, so if you didn't like it the first time, you get to not like it a second, and third time and so on. Halloween is usually my favorite time of year but after getting Junkenstein over and over, I never looked forward to it.I would not recommend this game. Blizzard is not the same company it used to be when it made good games. Now it's all about the money."
shinobu,0,August 11,20,,0,Not Recommended,"The current state of the game is a shadow of its former self, marred by practices that do not favor the players.I have thousands of hours in Overwatch and reached GM in every role. Overwatch was my favorite game of all time, but in the past few years, things have taken a bad turn.Back in 2016, the game stood out to me with its fresh approach to the competitive shooter genre. My passion continued through my college years in 2018, where I even started to compete at the collegiate level. Though the balance was sometimes terrible (e.g., Goats, double shield, double sniper), I sensed a genuine effort and passion from the developers. However, with the announcement of Overwatch 2 and the PVE, my excitement was followed with skepticism - a skepticism that, unfortunately, has been justified.The core of this game has been eroded by corporate greed, poor management, and decisions attributed to Bobby Kotick. Now free to play, Activision Blizzard appears determined to capitalize on every facet of the game, from battle passes to $15 PVE ""missions,"" reselling old skins, charging for heroes, eliminating free loot boxes, and even undermining the vitality of the Overwatch League.The current state of the game is a shadow of its former self, marred by practices that do not favor the players. I find myself unable to recommend Overwatch now or in the future, unless there is a monumental shift in Activision Blizzard's approach to become a company that values its community once again."

ZAXSTARR,0,August 21,12,,0,Not Recommended,"First off, I probably have somewhere around 1000+ hours combined between PC and Xbox. The original Overwatch was probably one of the biggest highlights of my entire gaming career, and I've been playing games since the Sega Genesis. It was absolutely bleeding with style, character, and polish, and aside from some balancing missteps and bugs here and there, my friends and I had an absolute blast playing this game almost every night, for years.Then comes Overwatch 2. The ""Promised Land"" of sequels, meant to redefine what a sequel really was (in Blizzard's own words). The purpose of this game was to introduce a whole PVE aspect to Overwatch and breathe new life into the game. Blizzard promised ""hundreds"" of missions, with the ability to essentially specialize in one of the 30+ characters in the roster and level them up, making them more powerful, etc. It sounded great.What we got instead was a patch that, overnight, took away:-All aspects of account progression (they removed account levels and player borders)-The ability to earn anything for free-An entire mode and some maps for that mode-The ""On Fire"" feature that rewarded good plays -End-of-match cards that allowed for players to talk about the match and vote for players who did well-One player from both teams (making it a 5v5 game instead of 6v6)-Collection counts on the hero screen (likely so that you aren't able to see how little you're actually earning now)What we got in its place was:-A ridiculously expensive and predatory cash shop-A battle pass-An unfinished and uglier UI than Overwatch 1Keep in mind, this was a product that we PAID for.And that's about it. You see, the PVE mode (you know, the reason for the sequel) was canceled, but Blizzard decided to go ahead with the update and simply wreck the game in the name of making cash. 5 year old skins that were once obtainable completely for free just by playing the game, are now $20 in the shop. Speaking of the shop, the game pushes it on you constantly, trying to sell you $70 or $80 ""deals"" that have like 2 or 3 skins in them. Skins that, once again, you would've been able to obtain for free, before the patch, simply by playing.Technically, you can still get skins just by playing, but you will earn them at a rate of something like one every 6 months. If you play every single day. Fantastic. Keep in mind that this is a game where you can freely change heroes mid-match, counter-picking is key to winning, and there are 30+ heroes. $20 per skin, in a first-person game at that. You do the math. Recently, 3 PVE missions were released in a pack for $15. Combined, they offer around 1 hour of content. If you're thinking about buying it, do yourself a favor and shop around on steam for 5 minutes in the $15 range and tell me how many games offer you 1 hour of content (with 0 replay value) for that price.Among all of its IPs, Blizzard has continuously and relentlessly outdone itself with each passing month to show just how far the depths of its greed can go. The release of Overwatch 2 in the state it was in was the company essentially bat-signaling the middle finger into the sky to its entire current playerbase while hoping to attract as many people who are addicted to battle passes and susceptible to FOMO as possible. It's a cash grab. That's all it is. Avoid it, and don't waste your time."

Here's your new f2p engine with a battle pass for pretties; screw og collectors, screw og fans, screw PvE players. Trickles of lore to classic characters now swamped in constant new characters (attached to grind or cash) and maps... good luck keeping up. Also, where is Mauga?

Followed by removing loot boxes (free ways to get cosmetics) and replaced it with a way too over priced shop that requires real money. Along with the shop added a battlepass that you can also pay for like the rest of these annoying games nowadays. Overwatch 2 is basically OW1 with less content. The main reason OW2 was supposed to exist was for the PVE modes they said they were gonna add but eventually just abandoned entirely. From what I just saw loading up the game to have enough playtime to review it on steam, they added a handful of some sort of new pve event thing....... that you have to pay real money for. They ruined what was once an actually decent game, all for a greedy disgusting cash grab that they know die hard fans are going to play and give into anyway."
lucas,5,August 10,29,,16,Not Recommended,"Now, where to begin on this absolute trainwreck of a game? I guess a good place to begin would be the current ridiculous over monetization. Where Activision/Blizzard told us a couple years ago that revolutionary sweeping changes were coming to Overwatch, in fact these changes were supposed to be so severe  that they ""couldn't do them without a sequel"".  The impression that was given to the player was that there would be faster content release and a whole PVE game mode with stories and ways to level up your characters for those modes. Only one of those promises were half fulfilled, content is slightly faster to come out. Anything of any significance though is behind either a wall of legitimate YEARS of play time or 20 to 30 dollars. A lot of these new skins are either recolors of old skins that were made in the time of the first release of Overwatch, where you had the loot box system. The loot box system was set up in a way where you would get a free one for leveling up by playing, and during events there would be different challenges you could do to get them. Not to mention the weekly arcade challenge where you could get 3 free lootboxes. You could get ANYTHING in the game other than Overwatch league skins at that time. I remember lootboxes being controversial and labeled as ""gambling"" by some organizations and were actually investigated by some governments. The thing is though that in Overwatch 1 those lootboxes, you never had anything guaranteed ofc and on some occasion you may buy 20 dollars worth of lootboxes and you would get every skin for an event, this was hardly ever necessary though. If you played Overwatch 1 for half the amount of time that Overwatch 2 expects out of you to level their battlepasses full of garbage, then you could get every skin from an event. The current expectation is that you spend the price of a full game for a handful of skins or pay 10 dollars for the battlepass and play for a thousand hours while you unlock mainly garbage while you see things in the shop that are on theme of the battlepass that SHOULD be in the battlepass selling for 20 to 30 dollars. Not to mention the predatory manipulative slimy business practice that should be Illegal, where companies have these things in their shop that are ""on sale"" from release and make it appear like you are getting a bargain. When the truth is the price that it is at is what they intended in the first place, they just are trying to condition people to accept higher and higher prices for garbage. You look at some of the prices that these things are supposed to before  the ""on sale"" status is added to them and it is 90 dollars for 3 overwatch skins. Hmm should I pay for several whole games on steam or should I pay for 3 low effort possible recolor overwatch skins?  I think that should be a fairly easy question to answer. Why is it that the lootbox system in overwatch and in video games in general were seen as so controversial and ridiculous, but the whole ""battlepass"" system and locking every bit of significant content behind walls of the prices for full games is not? You could bring up the argument that at least with the battlepass and monetization of characters and skins you at least get exactly what you pay for, but I played overwatch 1 during that time I got nearly every skin and ofc I got to play every character from their release. These skins were on the same level of quality as these new skins and honestly can be argued to be even better in some cases. I spent  little to no money on this game (except for 60 dollars on release). I can only imagine what it must be like for new players, where all of those old skins are behind the battlepass leveling or 10 to 20 dollars. I would not play the game in that situation. I don't know how they expect anyone to see it as a good game to get into. Enough on the monetization though, now to the quality of the game itself. One of the few significant changes made in this ""Sequel"" was the change from 6v6 to 5v5, where there used to be 2 tanks 2 dps and 2 supports there is now 1 tank 2 dps and 2 supports. Now because of the ""disadvantage"" that tanks were given by the removal of a tank, they decided to buff tanks to a ridiculous level where they are the deciding factor each game. Tanks a lot of the times feel immortal and hitscan dps like widowmaker also feel even more oppressive. Because they took a tank out of the game and barely thought about it. New characters that are being released for the game either feel way too strong (Kiriko, Rammatra) or way too weak (lifeweaver), not to mention they made a transition from 6v6 to 5v5 with only minor changes, wildly enough it is not balanced when the same amount of healing is going out that was meant to heal a 6 person team is healing a 5 person team. There is also the fact that there is no Overwatch league anymore, so there is no competitive scene for it. The competitive system has also been ruined, you play games until you win 5 and then after that you get to see what you new rank is. Where in Overwatch 1  you would see your SR go up or down by numbers, other than when you were playing your placement matches that you could get a big increase of SR if you did well in. It was a lot more transparent and satisfying to watch your SR climb. Now it's like you are constantly playing placement matches, but the reward for doing well in them is a lot of times only a tier rank up from silver 4 to 3. I was playing on an old account and I played my 5 placement matches for the season, the game said I was considered silver 4. I played my placement matches for the season and I won 2 games lost 1 then won 3 I did well each game and had the most damage and eliminations most of the time. After playing those games I placed silver 4, the rank I was told I was at in the beginning. I played 5 more games and won all 5 of them in a row and did similarly to the way I did in my placement games. I was then taken from silver 4 to 3. I won 90% of the 10 games I played and my reward was a single skill tier up. Imagine if you played 10 valorant games and won 9 out of ten of them, or any game that has a reasonable competitive system. I should have gone a whole skill division up not a tier. I am not going to sit there and play that garbage game for several days not even in the right skill ranking, because not only is it not challenging for me. It is also ruining the game play experience of the people I am playing with and against. This game is dying and I think we will see the day the servers are shut down, sooner than later if they don't make massive changes to not only their business practices, but the way that they balance the game. I am hopeful and excited for the day I get to read that Overwatch's servers are shutting down. So do I recommend this game? Absolutely not."

★Sinon★ <3,0,August 10,13,,0,Not Recommended,"So... About time that Blizzard decided to bring their games to Steam and oh boy. I want to let my frustration out.I played Overwatch for the first time in 2016 so since its launch and did quit the game around Season 10/April 2018 once Brigitte became available in ranked play. but I also played OW2 before in its first season Since then I kept on revisiting Overwatch once a year to see how the game was doing in hopes that Blizzard will learn from its mistakes and bring back OW to be a relevant game once more but that didn't happen.Overwatch 1 was doing very well from 2016 until 2018 that we kept getting real new content and constant balance changes to keep the game more fresh but also solve existing problems at the time like Mercy's Mass Rez ability that was loathed by the vast majority of the player base.Time passed on and it was clear that Overwatch was on life support with fewer hero releases and existing content being recycled like the Summer Games event for years. and at the end of its life cycle became full of cheaters as Blizzard's Warden anti-cheat solution wasn't being updated at all and was completely pointless to the point of making VAC to look like it is being actively developed.Game Balance was never the strongest thing for Blizzard. PvP World of Warcraft players of old were already accustomed to it but I will argue that OW during its first years wasn't too bad balance-wise and there was the sense that the developers were ready to listen and accept feedback to improve upon that aspect. Fast-forward to 2018 and we get Brigitte as a hard counter pick to the popular Dive meta by introducing a hero that is full of CC in a game that is based upon movement.While Blizzard did manage to shake the meta and introduce something new. it wasn't well received by the community at any capacity.

			Brigitte was supposed to save Overwatch. The game was being dominated by a single meta, Dive, and every match was playing out the exact same way.		

Imagine creating a hero so broken that makes an entire role invalid due to the meta it created around the same character (GOATs) and at some point was the sole reason of why role queue was introduced into the game in the first place.And here comes Overwatch 2, Blizzard announced that OW2 was already in development since 2019 and the original idea of the newer title was to add the story mode and expend upon the universe of the game but also gameplay by introducing different systems from RPGs like talent trees and allow the player to experiment with different options and have a system that promotes progression.Fast forward to OW2's actual launch. the promised PvE component was completely missing and the game was far from being ready to go. worse matchmaking, less maps, removal of 2CP in general. even basic features like being ""on-fire"" was completely absent despite the voice lines still existing in the game and WERE LITERALLY TRIGGERED but no visual feedback at all.Fun fact, According to the financial reports by Activision-Blizzard themselves. they are fully aware that Overwatch 2 launched in an early access state.https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-second-quarter-2022-financial""Overwatch 2 is planned to launch in early access on PC and console on October 4. With a free-to-play live service model designed to provide frequent and substantial seasonal updates, this launch kicks off the next chapter for the acclaimed team-based action game.""Then we hit the final straw that made a large part of the Overwatch player base to quit for good and this was the cancellation of the PvE story mode and instead they did split the idea into ""Story Missions"" which are being sold for 15 euros for about 90 minutes of content at most without the talent tree or customization that has been showcased years prior.Blizzard as a company simply cannot be trusted and doesn't deserve . if you want to get into Overwatch 2 and expecting the game to do well in the future then I'm very sorry to tell you that you will be disappointed right away.Overwatch 2 is a downgrade with a completely disgusting monetization system that it makes people to miss loot boxes... compared to the original game that we all have fallen in love with in the past.I would advice potential players to stay away from this game and Blizzard games in general."

And its not 'free to play' - with each battle pass costing almost 10 pounds I've basically paid for overwatch 1 again already. This is a game that doesnt care about its players and is doing everything to milk money out of every little release of content. I would not recommend it to anyone, go play tf2 kids."
Yugure,1,August 11,11,,0,Not Recommended,"Remember when Overwatch advertised itself as, ""Don't play classes, play heroes!"" Overwatch is, and has always been a cash cow made to appeal to escapists who just want an easy skill-ceiling based, flashy game, and to bad players who rage quit at tf2. The game has so many restrictions on skill curve development, and single player gameplay that it forces you to rely off being around your team; And since your abilities come back passively, and rapidly, making it more so ability reliant, then what reflex is there? TF2 is a semi reflex shooter sure, but even then its all about your movement control, and aim. Strong abilities take effort to charge; The few that're passive, Mad Milk/Gas Passer, don't instantly give you a powerful boost for a kill just cuz its ready. You can't even main a character without OW telling you to stop getting good at it.Overwatch doesn't complicate knowledge so all you have to do is press a button for easy rewards. Try teaching c-tapping to a Pharah main; Junkrat sticky jump dmg immunity go brr. Mercy can heal a player, but medic has to manage overheal. The perfect game for nihilistic players who didn't wanna grind out skill for glory, to learn to appreciate the ladder climb, who rage quit from tf2 for an easy to reward game like overwatch - or just outright start cheating.  Overwatch is quantity, over quality compared to TF2. TF2 class Loadouts offer a wide dynamic range of gameplay styles, and even full subclass sets that vary between weapons. Such as an ambushing crit-a-cola force-a-nature scout, degreaser flare combo pyro, revengineer, battle medic, fat scout, and even further with hard subclass loadouts like demoknight, trollgier, and the legendary hoovy. Running into a class, you never know what they'll have, and some weapons can even mitigate class counters so you best be ready. You see a scout and you know he's gonna be jumpy and dodgy, but dependent on the scouts loadout, his playstyle could be dramatically different with weapons. Overwatch on the other hand would rather split dynamic gameplay styles into their own characters. Everyone has the same single sets of weapons that can't be swapped to easily know what they'll be doing. So its much easier to read, and often times solid counter. You immediately know what they're capable of, and their limits to easily exploit right off the bat. Meanwhile for escapist players who just want big asses, and tits. Basic 'token' characters with simple dynamics, and little to no distinct, unique personalities just to milk out more names, and sometimes more waifus, in their roster. Sometimes even just for ""political inclusiveness"" rather than a genuine charming design. Still makes me laugh once overwatch had on their website ""don't play classes, play heroes!"" Though just remember, its what's on the inside that counts. Not a flashy diamond encrusted poop. Heroes die, but more often than not they can live long enough to become the villain. Just depends on the heart of it. You ready to respawn?tl;dr OW is a game designed for players who want an easy, and flashy game to get milked by greedy corpos just like genshrek im🅱️act"
PaulGR,0,August 11,36,,0,Not Recommended,"Disgusting F2P tactics deviating from the original OW formula in order to appeal to the 12yo Fortnite fanbase that can only afford ""free"" games while begging their parents for their credit card in order to buy ridiculously expensive skins and dances.There is absolutely no upgrade from the original OW. Everything looks and feels the same. They just slapped ""2"" next to the name as a marketing strategy because they decided to make the game F2P after the player-base died. I paid 60$ for OW1 and they removed it, so for owners of OW1 this is absolutely not a free game. We paid for it, and now we are forced to pay again through their awful and predatory battle-pass system if we want to get something as simple as an Emote.Everything is now locked behind ridiculous grinding and absurd weekly ""challenges"" that ask you to invest hours upon hours to complete them because they are based on luck (e.g., get 20 team kills). You need to pay 20 euro for a skin-recolor, or farm for 8 MONTHS to get it for ""free."" The supposed ""free"" rewards from the Battle-pass are joke-sprays and useless voice-lines. All the real things are locked behind the premium pay-wall that, upon completion, doesn't even give you your money/currency back (to invest it in the next Battle-pass). Essentially you need a bi-monthly subscription to play the game, as there is nothing to strive for in the ""free"" part of the Battle-pass.The new ""free"" players that joined are entirely oblivious to FPSs and make games very frustrating. They cannot DPS, they cannot flank, they cannot heal. They pick Moira and play her like its Call of Duty. The awful matchmaking system pairs these new users with existing veterans, making each match a steamroll. You either get destroyed and can't even leave the spawn room, or you entirely destroy the enemy team. There is no in-between. This makes games frustrating as you can lose 10 games in a row just like that.Overall, a disgusting re-release by Blizzard/Activision/Microsoft (or whatever company they sold themselves to nowadays). They turned a paid-game into a Freemium cow ready to be milked before it dies under the pretense that this is some sort of ""update"" or a big ""overhaul.""You can tell the game is dying by the mere fact that they brought this to Steam for a quick player-injection."

All my friends stop playing and playing alone is very bad because only people left in game is toxic... Make you just feel sad and get mad in game too because everyone is just rude. Not good for your mood and brain just better play fun games. Toxic people never get banned but if you defend yourself you get ban instead.Many micropay stuff now and game guality just bad every way. Battle pass is trash and you need pay lot of money all time to get items that was free before. You pay for this game one time and you get every item but now just need pay more and more and more for nothing. New heros always was free and you could play them when they come out but not now. You need unlock new hero with battle pass so there is time when your team need that hero but you can't play because you never unlock him. So stupid thing. Find better game to play.

Broccane,4,August 11,57,59,23,Not Recommended,"This Team Fortress 2 update is a massive step backward for the franchise, a disappointing departure from the qualities that once made it shine. The game initially boasted a diverse and charismatic cast of 9 classes, each brimming with personality and charm. However, Valve's recent decision to prioritize performative diversity, resulting in the addition of 37 seemingly one-dimensional characters, has raised concerns. This move feels more like a hasty attempt to cater to certain social trends and appease Twitter, now simply referred to as 'X'.My profound disappointment doesn't stop at the casting choices. The removal of the beloved Mann vs. Machine (MVM) mode and the cancellation of other player-versus-environment (PVE) content is a bitter pill to swallow. Instead, players are offered story missions for a steep price of $15, delivering a paltry hour of gameplay at best. The lackluster execution of these missions, featuring haphazardly designed adversaries that seem to do little more than rush at players and meet their demise, further adds to the letdown.One particularly perplexing decision was the elimination of the 12v12 format, ostensibly due to concerns about an overabundance of engineers in matches. This has been replaced by a lackluster 5v5 setup coupled with a 'Role Queue' system, significantly curtailing the potential for imaginative team compositions and strategic diversity. The frustrating part is that even classic classes like the engineer have seemingly fallen victim to the pressures of conforming to modern-day trends of performative diversity.In conclusion, this update has veered away from the core essence of what made Team Fortress 2 a beloved title, trading its unique and captivating gameplay elements for what appears to be an attempt at superficial inclusivity. The result is a disappointing regression that falls short of the franchise's once illustrious reputation."
𝘽𝙡𝙞𝙏𝙯⚡♿,0,August 11,32,2,10,Not Recommended,"I've played this for thousands of hours. Given its irreplaceable yet unique characteristic of 6v6 competitive game play, it is currently impossible to find a game that can be completely treated as a substitute of Overwatch. When Overwatch was just released in 2016, countless players were crazy about it, impressed, attracted, and addicted to this masterpiece by Jeff and his Blizzard team, including myself, and I even did not have a laptop to run the game but I still purchased collector's edition on the day of release... Sadly, the success of the game was ruined by blizzard itself after Jeff's resign. Without the ""Father"" of Overwatch, the development team was totally loss and they even did not know what exactly they are doing. I am lucky I was able to play Overwatch since 2020 yet was unlucky and desperate to see its current situation. With Bobby Kotick, the profit-driven nature of the bussinessman turned the game into a total piece of a trash which only cares about the money in players' pocket. The battle pass, ridiculous skin price and series of new heroes made in hurry further dragged the game into the inevitable death. As about worldview, the team no longer focus on enriching the heroes' background but turn to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ their LGBTQ experiences which is obviously overwhelming and useless except helping you trash team gathering more political correctness thus grabbing more money from a larger group of players. I still love Overwatch and play Overwatch 2, I play it because there is no alternative games, and I believe there are a lot of players have the same idea that they only love the original Overwatch (2016-2022). Blizzard, especially the Bobby guy, F u all. You deeply broke players heart.R.I.POverwatch2016-2022"

KingCrimson,0,August 15,27,,20,Not Recommended,"This game is the reason Ow 1 got no more content. We were promised so many things to make up for it. New modes, PvE and an overhaul to PvP gameplay. Now that we have all that is promised the results are lackluster. Firstly, you have to pay to unlock PvE which doesn't even have the fun stuff like skill trees anymore. Secondly, the PvE we got is ass. The move to 5v5 was a bad one in my opinion. All the Ow 1 maps were designed with 6v6 in mind. The little reworks. although better, don't make the maps feel that great. I also miss 2 tanks. Now all of the burden is on the one tank player. It can be very stressful. The new modes are hit or miss. Push is super tedious. If the enemy gets the first checkpoint, it is over. It's just running back and for for 10 minutes. I haven't played enough of Flashpoint yet but it seems to be pretty decent. It also includes a lot of running.One last thing is the skins/monetization in this game. In Ow 1 you got all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ through loot boxes or by buying them with in-game money. You got loot boxes very easily. Compare this to Ow 2 where you get new skins buying them with Overwatch coins. These coins can be purchased with real life money or through weekly challenges. You get 60 Overwatch coins a week (if you do all the tedious challenges). A new Legendary skin costs 1 900 Overwatch coins. That is 32 weeks for one skin. Another source for skins is the Battle pass. It costs only 1 000 Overwatch coins which is about 10 €. But you don't get any Overwatch coins from the Battlepass itself so you have to always buy the Battlepass again using real life money. Worst Battlepass in the history of gaming.In conclusion, don't buy anything in this game. It doesn't deserve your money.

TheFlashBat,0,August 13,26,,35,Not Recommended,"When the OG OW1 came out I recommended it to all my friends and we all played it together for about 2 or so years and they were some of the best years I've ever had playing games.Anyway fast forward to now, I couldn't recommend this game to anyone, the moment to moment game play is quite fun when the matchmaking isn't completely screwing you over. Like this game has issues on a fundamental level, so many broken or annoying characters that aren't fun to play or aren't fun to vs, the memes that come out of it are funny but still (solo shattering Sombra is never not satisfying).So the big issue with this ""sequel"" the greed; not only did they get rid of OW1 that you had to pay for?!? but they also made it almost impossible to get new skins without paying. In fact now (not for the first 2 or 3 seasons) you can only get like 1 or 2 legendary skins a season (these are only OW1 skins) which is disgusting. They also released this game with less content than the OG and a worse game mode that not a single person likes (push) and one less person on your team (see ya 6th guy). It is horrible that we have to play without one of our friends cause the game decided that being steamrolled or doing the steamrolling was a better solution to the shielding in the first game.Lastly this games PvE promise that was completely shattered and taken away... until it wasn't and was released in the current season with less content or features that now you have to PAY FOR like they don't earn enough from their greedy practises already. It is horrible what has happened to the game I used to love and it is amazing how the community fights back against it both in comments and now in the reviews, having this be the worst reviewed game on steam is both funny and concerning but I'm so happy we all collectively hate this game and this company.

However it quickly became stagnant, games were often very much one sided and the abilities for each character felt closer to a compensation for skill more than anything.Stuns, cheap escapes and then there was Symmetra who just felt downright useless.The sheer fact that ultimates did (and to my knowledge still do not) reset upon death basically takes out all the risk and reward factor.It's more so a tool for a free kill or two rather than something that could turn the tide of a game, such a scenario while not unlikely is a relative exception and not norm.I haven't touched the game all too much since somewhere in the winter of 2016, maybe once or twice because of peer pressure or by getting REALLY bored.Sure it's been years and this is Overwatch 2 and not 1..... but don't even bother trying to fool anyone, the number change was a glorified update.Considering the recent developments (or rather the lack thereof) surrounding PvE, I have no reason to believe it has gotten any better.Also, not really valid for game criticism but the community around the game was toxic AF, OW got praised to heaven like it invented a cure to cancer.Anything remotely critical of the game got struck down with fire and (especially) fury.Now the bit regarding the TF2 ""rivalry""That there is rivalry in quotation marks because as far as i am concerned, the two games are not that alike. But hey, here we are.Instead of taking the time to write down why, I will just leave it with a (modified to better fit the review) forum post I made a while back in a thread regarding the issue.Barely anyone wanted the TF2 v OW comparisons except for out of touch journalists, some fanboys looking for an easy target and Youtubers who didn't play either.

They made the situation like it is now thinking they could easily overcome a then 9 year old game with more performance issues than an insecure skinny teen forced to wrestle a balkan bodybuilder.

Yet here we are where the cancellation of the sole justification for OW2s existence has driven them to a competing (and arguably better) storefront, owned by the same company that made TF2 no less, It really goes to show what a laughing stock OW has become.

TF2 did not invent the class-based genre, TF2 barely invented anything. Same for OW.
But hey OW was there to replace TF2! they insisted on the comparisons, and now that the situation isn't so rosey anymore, they gotta stick it into their pipes and smoke it.The gist: Avoid, play Warioware or smth."

The only reason why is that the higher ups at Blizzard are trying to squeeze every single dollar out of your wallet, and every our of your free time. The Story Mode that they originally planned for this game is left in bits and pieces and then locked behind a paywall so you can cough up your hard earned cash to there predatory and downright disgusting micro-transactions. I started playing when it launched back in 2022 without any prior experience with the first one, I was excited to try this out and see why people called it the best Hero Shooter of the decade, only to find a hollow shell of a great game filled with $20 skins, barely any content, and a horrible Battle-Pass with no good rewards that aren't skins and critical Heroes locked behind it. I tried to give this game a fair shot, but the game had other issues as well, like a horrible matchmaking system for casual play, and the lack of anything fun that isn't casual and ranked. The way you unlock new Heroes is also very excruciating. You have to win 32 matches for each new hero by playing the class there from, but you can't do these simultaneously like every other quest in the game, you have to do each by itself for a total of 192 SEPERATE MATCHES THAT YOU HAVE TO WIN. and once the season ends, the new Hero will also be included with that with 32 more matches to win. and guess what, you can bypass this by paying $10 per hero, roughly the same price for the Battle Pass.The amount of crap that this game throws at you just to come off as a ""Sequel"" is laughable. And we shouldn't be blaming the crew for this. They have been trying there best to keep us satisfied while dealing with the higher ups and there constant chicanery. The only reason why I said you should get the Invasion Bundle is so you can get the game they want to make. And who knows, if we could all not buy anything else and just get the Story Missions, we can show them what game we want, not what we have."

These missions cost money, a stupidly high amount and add nothing new gameplay wise, it's more of the same crap they gave us before, with some new paint and maybe some new enemy types, but nothing near worth the price of entry.Overwatch has had an extreme fall from grace, partially due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way the game has been treated, partially due to all the scumbag stuff happening behind the scenes at ActiBizz, either way, this game is a hollow shell of what it used to be, it's still good for a quick few rounds if you have an FPS itch and don't want to hard commit, but that's all it's good for, as the games life is horrid now.At least I can still find all the OW P0rn I want online though, least those dudes have a good history and bring me extreme joy when I need it.Simply put, F**k Blizzard and what they do, they hate the fans, and just want all your money for zero effort. ╭∩╮（︶︿︶）╭∩╮"

Vociferous,0,August 11,58,,0,Not Recommended,"Don't mind the time played, I've been in since the open beta. This game has been plagued by bad design decisions since its launch almost a decade ago.The gameplay and balancing have gotten worse and worse over time, leading to more annoying, less fun matches.They tried to scrub away criticism and flagging player numbers by re-launching a worse version of the game in an update called Overwatch 2. They deleted the previous version of the game from existence and removed the ability to earn skins, while also adding battle-passes and a skin store that uses real-money currency. The creators and owners have many cases of sexual harassment towards women as well, which I find much worse than bad game decisions alone. Their response to this going public was removing sexual jokes from World of Warcraft and renaming one of the characters in this game, because he was named after a predatory man. They did not make any actual changes to the company or admit any wrong-doing, opting to try to pay-off the women making these claims.This game is bad and so is the company who owns it.

tf2dove,0,August 11,8,,17,Not Recommended,"+578 hours from Battle.netPVPOverwatch's PVP gameplay loop is pretty solid. A relatively fun mode, albeit a mostly toxic community makes it a bit dicey at times. Would recommend against playing the competitive mode for that point alone.PVEOverwatch's PVE gameplay loop is currently quite stale. Fun for a singular playthrough, but to be candid, their older OW1 ""Archives"" event had better and more unique PVE scenarios, and therefore more replayability. There's not much variance in what you're tasked to do and the enemies you fight. Widespread PVE is still a newer part of the game, so it's very likely this'll change, but releasing a very stale free mission and putting the remaining at-launch ones behind a $15-25 paywall does not instill trust.MicrotransactionsSpeaking of, the current F2P + microtransaction setup for OW2 is awful. It attempts to coax you into cracking open your wallet at essentially every juncture. In OW1, this was just cosmetics, cosmetics you could get for free if you played enough. However now, there are some things you absolutely have to pay for, including heroes and playable content. This has the possibility of being rational, given that the game is now free, but the sheer lack of new content (both free and paid) makes this impossible to defend. OW1's monetization was great for the consumer and still offered Blizzard substantial money. OW2's painful monetization screws over the consumer and makes Blizzard even more money.BalancingAs for overall balance, OW1 and OW2 have some notable differences. The first is a change from 6v6 to 5v5. Might be a controversial take, but this has been a fresh improvement for the game. Makes the gameplay faster, makes it less about shooting and wearing down shields. However, it has forced tanks to become generalist vs a main and an off tank. Blizzard hasn't balanced this yet, and some tanks absolutely suck whereas some absolutely shred. The lack of two tanks does make the tank role a bit more stale at times too.The second and final main change is their hero balancing. They've never been great at it, even in OW1, but for OW2 they've had an obsession with converting more specialized heroes into generalists. For some heroes this has been great, for others, it has removed fun and unique parts of their kits. They've removed stuns and Mei's freeze, but still have pencil-thin one-shot snipers. Makes the gameplay a lot more stale and repetitive, makes freshness and fun depend on developer patches rather than player choice.TL;DRGiven all of this, the rebranding from OW1 to OW2 was essentially just a marketing gimmick and excuse to charge for more macrotransactions. They flopped on delivering robust PVE, and haven't really added anything substantially new in quite a while. It's clear the devs still care, as the training range and new additions have been made with notable effort, but in terms of newness and freshness, nothing to warrant a sequel just yet."

joy!,4,August 11,8,2,0,Not Recommended,"Overwatch 2 seems to have taken a different path from its previous player-focused approach, adopting a veneer of continuity from its predecessor while clearly prioritizing financial gains.Back in 2016, I initially dove into the game and, like countless others, was quickly captivated by its charm. Overwatch remained a staple among my favorite shooters over the years, even during content droughts leading up to the arrival of OW2.While the game's endearing design, captivating cast of characters, and impressive multiplayer maps remain intact, Overwatch 2 has introduced significant changes that cast a shadow over its core essence. Allow me to elaborate:#1 - Limiting Heroes through the Battlepass StructureOne of the most notable changes is the confinement of heroes within the Battlepass structure, a change of considerable significance.Overwatch is built on hero selection and team dynamics. Each character brings unique advantages, with varying levels of compatibility. In its previous iteration, Overwatch introduced new heroes to the player base, fostering an inclusive environment without financial barriers. However, Overwatch 2 now requires either a significant time commitment or monetary investment through the Battlepass to access new heroes upon release (or a fee of £9 for established heroes).While this might seem innocuous, it results in players engaging in competitive gameplay with an incomplete hero roster.Essential gameplay aspects are now locked behind a financial threshold, undermining the principles of fair competition.How can fair competition persist when some players have more options solely due to financial spending? The resemblance to a ""pay-to-win"" model is evident, though I leave it to your judgment to form this conclusion.#2 - The Battlepass Structure and Cosmetic EvolutionMy stance on the Battlepass structure has been somewhat agreeable in the past. However, when compared to similar systems in other games, OW2's implementation falls short. Each Battlepass iteration offers 80 tiers of rewards, typically including 8 distinct skins (plus a customizable variant at the end), along with various additional items. These extras include titles, emblems, and emotes. It's worth noting that a recent addition is ""credits,"" a commendable addition but one that doesn't fully address the core issue of locking essential gameplay elements behind a paywall.Cosmetics have always played a significant role in Overwatch, showcasing the creativity of artists and designers behind exceptional skins. These designs still hold aesthetic value, but their pricing is audacious. Notably, legendary skins, representing more than just color variations, average around £20 each.In the past, these cosmetic items were attainable through lootboxes, granted with each player level increase, a frequency that seemed reasonable. In my personal experience, I rarely purchased lootboxes directly but managed to amass a considerable collection of skins across various characters. The transition to a commercial model was explained as a necessity due to the alleged financial strain of the lootbox system, a claim I find debatable. By 2019, a mere three years after launch, Overwatch had generated $1 billion through lootbox sales.Currently, avenues for acquiring cosmetics without spending money are limited, unless one is willing to invest months in obtaining a single legendary skin through extended gameplay.#3 - The Practice of PvE ImplementationWhile I personally leaned more toward Player versus Environment (PvE) experiences, it's crucial to acknowledge that Overwatch 2 initially highlighted this aspect as a central pillar of its offering.In theory, that was the promise; however, the actual outcome seems like a bait-and-switch maneuver, seemingly aimed at introducing new monetization methods. Surprisingly, even after the apparent scaling down of PvE efforts, isolated PvE missions persist, though they are available as separate purchases, serving as another channel for monetary gain.In ConclusionFor fans of competitive shooters, Overwatch 2 appears to deviate from the principles of competitive fairness.For those interested in cosmetic acquisition, Overwatch 2 demands a significant financial commitment.While the fun factor remains, maintaining hints of the enjoyable experience from the past, it is overshadowed by the intrusion of profit motives to an extent that leads me to withhold full endorsement for discerning enthusiasts."

Julia ♡,0,August 13,8,,22,Not Recommended,"Been playing Blizzard's games for over a decade and Overwatch 1 was one my favorite games of all times. I played around 1.400 hours and couldn't get tired of it. However Overwatch 2 was the biggest mistake I could possibly imagine since the announcement day. The major problem is not only the fact that OW2 is legit the same game ending with a ""2"" in the title, but also that it was primarily supposed to be free with the (actual only different content) pve game mode.With that said I can only hope - not only - from Blizzard but the whole OW crew to take a moment to think why those reviews are being overwhelmingly negative, cause that's what happens when you release a game promising new things and being basically the same old thing but with priced game modes and abusive pricey skins in the shop when you could get it for free in the old loot boxes. TLTR: Listen to your public. Overwatch has a solid community and this game could possibly be as good as it was before."

Keron,0,August 11,8,,0,Not Recommended,"I used to love this game, pre ordered it and played it for more than a year straight.Coming back to this in OW2, I don't even know what game this is anymore.Starting of, this game doesn't need the number 2, it's the same game with one less hero in the team and way less items for you to get (unless you wanna spend some money).Lootboxes were evil you say? Tell me then, how lootboxes were a million times fairer than the trash they have now.I stopped playing before Moira came out, all the characters before her are between 60-90 items collected, good luck getting even near that now, especially without spending money (which I never did btw, apart from buying the game and the first pass of OW2). The lootboxes were random af, gave you a ton of repeat items, but all the repeats gave you credits, you could get enough to buy your favorite skin pretty fast tbh.And that's all a cosmetic problem, which imo is very important in this game, but that isn't all,Gameplay wise, this game is a shell of what it used to be. The change from 6 players to 5, at least imo sucks. 2 tanks were much better than 1.And the new ranking system is very bad, feels so random. You win and then you derank, you have no idea what kind of mmr you have, there's no points system for it to be clear.I made the mistake of coming back when OW""2"" came out and buying their pass, will never do that again.Random ass game, you either stomp or get stomped, there's no in between.If you wanted any good will bringing this game on steam first, you made the wrong choice blizzard.EDIT: I actually forgot about something that you clearly want us to forget. Remember the PvE mode you cancelled? Why are you selling it now, or at least parts of it?"

Hearing the sequel get announced in 2019, it was hard for me to be more excited.October last year, after some disappointing betas, I got in Day 1, and it stayed disappointing.Nothing feels the same and the battle pass just damages it too far. Feels grindy, and while it isn't as bad as before, it just stopped feeling like I was moving up or moving toward anything. Like a waste of time.If the original were in its place, I'd highly recommend anyone to play it. By far some of the most fun I've ever had, from pure excitement to pure rage. It was exciting being a part of something so fantastic.As of now, that isn't the case.Very upsetting and while I hope things turn around, I don't see how they will, if they can at all."

Aperture,0,August 11,10,3,101,Not Recommended,"Team Fortress 2 is a 2007 multiplayer first-person shooter game developed and published by Valve Corporation. It is the sequel to the 1996 Team Fortress mod for Quake and its 1999 remake, Team Fortress Classic. The game was released in October 2007 as part of The Orange Box for Windows and the Xbox 360, and ported to the PlayStation 3 in December 2007. It was released as a standalone game for Windows in April 2008, and updated to support Mac OS X in June 2010 and Linux in February 2013. It is distributed online through Valve's digital retailer Steam, with Electronic Arts managing retail and console editions.Players join one of two teams—RED or BLU—and choose one of nine character classes to play as, with game modes including capture the flag and king of the hill. Development was led by John Cook and Robin Walker, the developers of the original Team Fortress mod. Team Fortress 2 was announced in 1998 under the name Team Fortress 2: Brotherhood of Arms. Initially, the game had more realistic, militaristic visuals and gameplay, but this changed over the protracted nine years of development. After Valve released no information for six years, Team Fortress 2 regularly featured in Wired News' annual vaporware list among other entries. Finally released on the Source game engine in 2007, Team Fortress 2 would preserve much of the core class-based gameplay of its predecessors while featuring an overhauled, cartoon-like visual style influenced by the works of J. C. Leyendecker, Dean Cornwell, and Norman Rockwell, alongside an increased focus on the visual and verbal characterization of its playable classes and what the developers have described as a 1960s spy movie aesthetic.Team Fortress 2 has received critical acclaim for its art direction, gameplay, humor, and use of character in a wholly multiplayer game, and since its release has been referred to as one of the greatest video games ever created. The game continues to receive official Valve server support as of July 2023, in addition to new content being released on a seasonal basis in the form of submissions made through the Steam Workshop. In June 2011, the game became free-to-play, supported by microtransactions for in-game cosmetics. A 'drop system' was also added and refined, allowing free-to-play users to periodically receive in-game equipment and items. Though the game has had an unofficial competitive scene since its release, both support for official competitive play through ranked matchmaking and an overhauled casual experience were added in July 2016. Since early 2020, the official Valve servers have seen an influx of bot accounts using cheat software, often inhibiting legitimate gameplay."

osek,0,August 13,16,,0,Not Recommended,"Overwatch, Borderlands 2 and Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped are the best games I played in my life. They are milestones in bombarding my dopamine receptors. I'm still playing BL2 and CB3 (Insanity remaster) from time to time, but I'm not able to play OW. Instead, I'm going to write a review about that abomination which is OW2.Blizzard made so many things wrong with this title that I don't know exactly where to start, so I will focus on the biggest changes. Transition to F2P made this game more accesible to other people. Of course, that has it's own cons and pros. But looking at bigger picture, this made this game more expensive. Before, you just had to pay 60$ and that's all. F2p means that game itself is free, but other things within this game have a price, which accumulating over time can cost more, but that brings us to the biggest con of this game - characters behind a paywall. You can unlock character later in free battle pass path, which takes a lot of time, or you can buy it, and get it imedietly. You can get premium currency via doing daily chalanges, but it's really tedius. New characters usually are op (Kiriko), so if you want to play comp, you have to get them. All of those points creates such a big FOMO, I had to stop play after a month because it felt so wrong, it's a really predatory monetization.After a while not playing this game I checked what's going on with PVE. It supose to have skill trees, something like MvM. I was really hoping it's going to bring something fresh... and they scraped it. Instead, it's your regural seasonal event like Archives. And of course, behind a 15$.Opinion about change from 6v6 to 5v5 varies from person to person. To me, it's a negative. One of the core mechanics in this game is ability to change a character mid game. But, balancing everything is a hard task. So, if you have Doom Fist one trick and enemy have Orisa, that's a gg, because you can't help him tankig, because there is only 1 tank slot. Would it better if they divided roles as Tank/Tank/DPS/DPS/Support? That's your usuall composition in Paladins, but they have draft and ban system (at least in competitive). In OW2 it would still bring you to sup dif, but I think it could be less severe.Is there anything positive in this title? Everything that was positive in the first game - gameplay, characters, maps, music, net code, art style, performence. OW was a 10/10 game for me in 2016/2017. But this is a review for OW2, which feels like a rip of. This is painful because I invested arround 1KH playing it, and it's a time well spent, I had a great time. For me, it's like a son I really love, who had a really good grades in college, but he turned into a junky selling his body for a crack.TL:DR blozord bad"
Yuedar,1,August 11,23,,32,Not Recommended,"I've been playing Overwatch since the beta of Overwatch 1 in 2016. This is the most mismanaged IP that I have ever been a part of. This game had and still has a lot of potential but the devs or the suits that control the devs have turned this into a complete cash grab microtransaction ♥♥♥♥ show. I never would have gotten into this game in the state that it is in now and it saddens me that the younger gaming community accepts this sort of thing as normal now. Signing into overwatch on steam is more complicated than just using the Bnet launcher. I had to download this game a 2nd time so it now resides on my harddrive twice. That will be remedied soon. The PvE isn't worth the price tag. Play this game enough and you'll likely see your account suspended temporarily just from toxic teammates that get frustrated they lost while an automated report system never has anyone real checking it. The quality of this player base has gone drastically down hill since this game became free to play too. Gone are the days of strategy with team comps, and playing objectives. Now your tank will lose patience and just yeet themselves forward after a won fight going into the enemy spawn only to die while the rest of your team is left to defend the objective without your singular tank because Blizzard thought having a 5v5 was better than a 6v6 with 2 tanks. The battlepass system will make you yearn for the day of loot boxes. thats saying something but albeit true. When you bought Overwatch the original the entire cast of heros was available from the second you got the game. So when I saw on steam you had to buy the heros to unlock them that just seems ridiculous. That used to be just part of the game. So much for free to play? In a game thats so heavily focused on team play, coordination, communication etc how have they never built a guild/clan function into this game by now? They the devs still don't seem to know what they're doing with Symmetra. The change to showcasing your rank has gone backwards. You used to just see a flat number change after every game. Now you could go 5-2 and not get a promotion and just be left wondering why? You could ask the community and be given every theory craft imaginable but the truth is noone will know. In Overwatch 1 you would of known exactly where you stood to the singular number. This change was made to get people out of their heads for playing ranked. Yikes. Frankly the only good things that came from OW2 is the ping system and the scoreboard during a game. Give me those 2 things with the Overwatch 1 game (the new heros are fine too) and frankly i'd just be playing that over this."

Aleksej,2,August 24,7,,0,Not Recommended,"I am writing on behalf of my sister, who was permanently banned in this “masterpiece” without any reason (I myself played from the first Overwatch and also tried the second one, but now I definitely won’t return to it). Sis: “I started playing with my brother on the release of the OW2, as he had good memories of the first one. In FPS shooters, I was a complete noob, but I liked this game and I even made friends in it, with whom I began to actively play and was able to raise the Gold 2 rank in a year without experience. But at some point, I started to come across inadequate players who thought that I was playing the support role poorly (although they themselves didn’t play so well on damage dealers and tanks - KDA was negative) and spammed unpleasant things in the chat and voice chat. I tried not to be rude to them, but sometimes I could not control myself and answered sharply. And in the end looks like I met some overly gentle aggressors (or I was unlucky and I answered the “genius” moderator) who falsely reported me and I received a permanent ban. In support, after trying to convey my position and after asking for an explanation why I received a ban, they ignored me and sent exactly the same email about the blocking. After a year of experience in this game (which I also donated to), this was a spit in the face from Blizzard. And now I have no motivation to play in this game. I no longer hope for the adequacy of support and with this review I want to warn new players what to expect: inadequate F2P community, ignoring problems from Blizzard and, in addition, overpriced customization.”"

larguu,3,August 13,13,,7,Not Recommended,"Blizzard Entertainment's 2016 video game Overwatch inspired a notable amount of fan-made pornography. The game's distinct and colorful character designs drew the attention of many online content creators, resulting in sexually explicit fanart. Character models were ripped from the beta versions of the game and subsequently spread, edited, and animated on the Internet.Animated pornography shorts and sexualized imagery featuring official character models constitute the main content of Overwatch pornography. Original pornography fan artists (animators and illustrators) are most commonly based on social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Tumblr, while they upload their works to file hosting services like MEGA, Gfycat, Webmshare, and Google Drive. Pornographic content is created primarily through Valve's Source Filmmaker (SFM) and Blender.Overwatch pornography usually consists of short pieces of video featuring characters such as Tracer, D.Va, and Mei. Blizzard initially issued cease-and-desist orders to some prolific creators through an independent security firm, though the game's director described the situation as ""an inevitable reality of the internet in 2016."" Video game journalists have described the abundance of (pornographic) fan works as a positive indicator for the game's longevity. Pornographic works of the game remained a topic of discussion long after that game's release, with artists making content of the game's post-launch characters, and Overwatch-related search topics continuing to be popular on porn websites.Overwatch and its pornographic community has inspired various groups and companies to produce adult content related to the game. Brazzers produced a ""porn parody"" based on Overwatch in September 2016. The website Overpogcom started producing a Playboy-style magazine about the game in late 2016, until they were forced to stop in February the following year. Overwatch has inspired both sexualized cosplay and pornographic virtual reality works."

I think its really revolutionary how you are rewarded with absolutely nothing for playing free to play and also the way we are all blessed with the privilege to pay a mere $15 for a whopping 3 missions!! Blizzard have also proven to have the best game balancing team world-wide, with their almost magical ability to buff overpowered characters and abandon the underpowered and useless ones!! Truely and overwatch experience 9,999,999/10, im so glad i payed for overwatch 1 on multiple platforms"
Bathory 🐐,0,August 11,7,,0,Not Recommended,"Blizzard, joined the team of companies that annihilated all their franchises, as well as Konami, EA, and Ubisoft...greed, disrespect for consumers and employees, lack of content and creativity, forgetting all the details which made him become a giant in the gaming industry. I miss ""Overwatch 1"" - and also, I never thought I'd say this, but I miss the ******* ""loot boxes"" system - even though it's embarrassing, it was still a better system than it is today, they do everything to take it away your money and they don't give you anything. A game that ended up being stagnant in time, due to a direction with abusive and anti-consumer practices"
Todd Howard´s weakest warrior,0,August 11,8,,0,Not Recommended,"California Files a Lawsuit Against Activision BlizzardOn July 20, 2021, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a lawsuit against Activision Blizzard after a lengthy two-year investigation. According to Bloomberg Law, the agency accused the company of promoting a “‘frat boy’ culture” that put female employees in the crosshairs. While women only made up approximately 20% of Activision Blizzard’s employee population, they experienced “constant sexual harassment, unequal pay, and retaliation.” One of the biggest discoveries was the pervasiveness of what the lawsuit dubbed “cube crawls,” where male employees got drunk, crawled their way through cubicles, and participated in “inappropriate behavior toward female employees.” Many male employees also allegedly openly joked about rape and passed off their responsibilities to their female coworkers just so they could slack off and play video games. Moreover, female employees claimed they were passed over for promotions because “they might become pregnant.” However, arguably the most troubling accusation listed in the lawsuit is the reveal that one unnamed female Activision worker committed suicide while on a company trip with an unnamed “male supervisor.” She was allegedly the victim of “intense sexual harassment” to the point where nude pictures of her were circulated during a company holiday party.Former Blizzard President J. Allen Brack Addresses the Harassment Allegations Before Leaving the CompanyShortly after the sexual harassment allegations came to light, many prominent figures in the gaming industry expressed how much the news distressed them. One such person was then-Blizzard President J. Allen Brack. He claimed to know nothing about the harassment and wanted to help ensure the wellbeing and safety of Blizzard’s employees, which is all well and good save for one crucial detail: He was mentioned by name as having prior knowledge of the harassment and reportedly did nothing about it, all while acting “too friendly” to female employees. The other prominent Blizzard figure directly named in the lawsuit is Alex Afrasiabi. He reportedly told women he wanted to marry them and tried to kiss them, among other actions, and his supervisors had to “pull him off” his victims multiple times. While Brack and Afrasiabi left Activision Blizzard (or, in Afrasiabi’s case, was fired) due to their connection with the lawsuit, they weren’t alone. Diablo 4’s Lead Designer Jesse McCree, World of Warcraft designer Jonathan LeCraft, and Lead Game Designer Cory Stockton were all fired after their part in the company’s sexual harassment scandal came to light.Frances Townsend (or Bobby Kotick?) Sends a Troubling Internal EmailControversial Activision Blizzard Vice President Frances Townsend (who formerly worked for the Bush administration) disturbed many people in and outside of the company when she reportedly sent an email that called the allegations outlined in the investigation a “distorted and untrue picture of our company” and generally attempted to downplay the validity and severity of the situation.Later, the Wall Street Journal reported that the email was actually written by Activision CEO Bobby Kotick. Author aside, the tone-deaf nature of the email caused many Blizzard employees to immediately respond in their own way…Activision Blizzard Employees Stage A WalkoutAs news of the lawsuit and its allegations spread through Activision Blizzard’s workforce, many employees staged a walkout in response. Tempers didn’t calm down afterward. If anything, emotions rose after reports hit that many higher-ups knew about the accusations and did nothing about them. Over 100 employees walked out in protest and shared a clear demand: Fire CEO Bobby Kotick. Moreover, well over 2,000 employees signed a letter that called the company out on their response. According to the organization behind many of the employee protests, ABK Workers Alliance, many of the employees’ demands have not been met. That was true back in August of 2021, and it is still true today. Moreover, the Communication Workers of America labor union called Activision Blizzard’s $18 million settlement deal over sexual harassment allegations, “a slap in the face” since the company is worth $72 billion.Fans and News Outlets Refuse to Play and Cover Activision Blizzard GamesShortly after the sexual harassment lawsuit came to light, a huge portion of the Blizzard fanbase boycotted the company and its games. Many gamers and streamers, including those who were known for playing titles like World of Warcraft and Hearthstone, refused to touch the games. They weren’t alone, as sites such as The Gamer, Prima Games, and GameXplain elected to cease all coverage of Activision Blizzard titles. No good news, no bad news, just deafening silence until, as The Gamer Editor in Chief Kirk McKeand put it, “there’s some real change.”Allegations Against Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick Are Made PublicRecently, many allegations regarding Activision Blizzard’s CEO, Bobby Kotick, have come to light. For instance, according to the Wall Street Journal, he once sent an intimidating voicemail to one of his assistants, threatening to kill her. And yes, he also allegedly knew about the sexual harassment in his company and did nothing about it. Well, that’s not entirely true — he apparently protected the perpetrators and refused to report the incidents to the company’s board of directors. This led to another lawsuit filed by investors angry over Kotick’s “issuing materially false and misleading statements during a class action period.”I literally forgot that Tracer was lesbian because of much she gets pipe´d these days.May God bless Blender artists.Also there isn´t a single good Activision Blizzard game these days."

spy-induced noise complaints,5,August 11,14,,3,Recommended,"A small premise: I am mostly a casual gamer, not interested in the competitive side of games, nor do I care about skins and other features that don't directly affect the gameplay (I played hatless for a long time even in tf2 :) ). The core game itself is solid, it's basically the original OW but 5v5 - if you don't know it's basically a FPS shooter with heroes, each of which has its own abilities and an ultimate. This is in practice a weaboo rebranding of the classic ""choose your weapon"" and ""choose your powers"" mechanic. Like all multiplayer games, it's way more enjoyable with friends, especially considering the large amount of toxic basement dwellers infesting this game :-)From a graphical perspective OW2 is not particularly innovative but at least looks pretty and doesn't require a very powerful PC to run, something which is honestly quite underrated today. From a sonic point of view, OW2 is great, but while the OST contains mostly forgettable (but still well-made!) pieces, the sound design steals the show.Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room, which is also the reason behind the (currently) very angry reviews: the F2P model. Currently a battle pass (around €10) is required to unlock new heroes in an easy and painless way AND to be able to play the latest hero; heroes introduced in previous seasons can be unlocked without paying by winning around 30 matches for each (and some other easy challenges in the practice range), and the one introduced in the current season by getting to ~50 levels in the FREE battle pass. This is not something I like but it's not as unreasonable as others say (you don't pay with your money, you pay with your time).I don't care about the PVE, but some have legit concerns about that too.Of course, compared to the previous one-off payment for OW1 this is a downgrade, but not worthy of a (currently) ""10% total positive reviews"", especially considering much more infamous free to play models in other games."

Steam will not save you, BlizzardWhat is there to even say? The one co-op mission available to all is just a point-defense horde mode for the majority of the level. I wanted to stop playing after 5 minutes. The only reason Overwatch 2 is a thing is because Blizz had to implement a battle pass system to tip-toe around the new laws/regulations when it comes to loot boxes, and nobody can convince me otherwise. For example, loot boxes are outright illegal in multiple European countries like Belgium, Finland, and the Netherlands.The PVE experience that was supposed to be justification for this sequel has been completely scrapped, you know, the thing that they promised years ago. So why bother with this game? This is just as big of a scam as Destiny 2, with the exception of paid content being taken from you."

ihunterjack,0,August 21,16,,0,Not Recommended,"Activision Blizzard lied. Overwatch 1 was great, the only problem was the loot boxes. Activision knew the laws would be changed to ban gambling, which is what the loot boxes are. So the came out with Overwatch 2. Overwatch 2 has no loot boxes BUT they force you to spend money on a pointless battle pass to play any of new heroes, and then they made those heroes overpowered so have to play them if you want to be competitive, if you don't pay your heals won't be as good, your damage won't be as good etc... it's a pay to win system, it sucks. They change you for everything! Skins, guns, MISSIONS!, just more and more way to charge you and get money out of you. I'm not talking nickle and dimes here I'm talking thousands of dollars to get what you randomly got for free.The only update that Overwatch 2 received was monetization. It's not as fun, you feel annoyed because of the constant and stupid battle pass, we don't want to pay for that crap multiple times a year... Activision Blizzard then lied about the content of the game, the modes, the mods, the specs... don't spend money on this game it's all a lie. Overwatch 1 was a better and more complete game and that was the problem, they hated on the fact that you got so much for free. I hope they enjoy people not playing any of their products. FYI Diablo 4 has much of the same predatory monetization going on too. None of this is fun, it's just a massive cash grab for Activision Blizzard stock holders.It might show that I played for .3 hours but over 1000 hours playing easily. It's a shame that activision blizzard is just another cash grab company. They sell you lies, take your money and then gaslight you into thinking you should not complain."

																Very Limited Options for new players to enjoy. Locked up gamemodes and characters, skins are overly expensive and PVE has payment. Not worth playing if your a new player to overwatch 2 and Blizzard's shady ass past, maybe if they didn't abuse they're women, maybe this shouldn't happen, though by then, Blizzard is now the new EA of this generation and both as equally as worst.If you want to play any other shooter games, TF2 and CS:GO are your best bet.TF2 has always been a casual gaming experience for the past year and it's a good way to past the time without being serious about playing.CS:GO is also good for both casual and competitive prospectively, though you might need to invest some skills if you want to be good at the game but it's much more rewarding on learning the ways to play the game, very worth playing. Plus you can make money out of this game which is a big W.Either way, nothing to say about this game except that the developers suck ass including Blizzard themselves with their shady past of abusing women. Hopes for blizzard's future is to go broke someday and never to be seen again. These Overwhelming Negative review's are well deserve."
Hezrou,0,August 17,9,,0,Not Recommended,"Blizzard promised PvE in OW2 which was their justification to kill OW1. It's basically OW1 with 5v5 rather than 6v6. Same game, same maps, same everything but now you pay 20$ for skins, forced FOMO down your throat so you're forced to play over and over and over again or risk losing out forever, predatory behavior and remember that PvE promise I mentioned earlier? Yeah. They lied about that. There is no PvE and they said they won't add it. They probably will eventually, but it's not their FOCUS like they said it would have been. They've scammed their fanbase, ruined what made OW great and gutted it entirely. The only reason they are on steam is because they're desperate for cows to milk. You want a good game? Go play TF2 or ANY other game on Steam. Trust me. You won't regret skipping tf out of this game. Blizzard is just looking for people to milk. Don't fall for the trap.

Heroshi,3,August 10,10,,3,Not Recommended,"No. Save your time. Save your money.Overwatch ""2"" is a slap in the face, not only to fans of the original release, but the industry as a whole. It's an MTX riddled clownfest that has no respect for itself, or it's players.- The original director left abruptly before the game even came out. Massive red flag right there.- FOMO tactics and horrible MTX. Free players get very little.- Removed content and features the original game had, and added very little to compensate for it.- New characters are locked behind the battlepass. When the battlepass expires, you still have to go through an obnoxious unlock process. In a hero-based shooter that makes heavy use of counter picking, I don't need to tell you how bad this is for the health of the game.- The supposed reason the game was being developed, the PvE mode, was cancelled. You can still play the missions, but there is very little replay-ability behind them without the main, advertised feature. Not only this, they still have the gall to charge for them, and will likely continue to do so with future mission releases.- The game was changed from 6 v 6 into 5 v 5. This is subjective, but I believe it greatly harmed the game and sucked a lot of fun out of it. No one liked double shield, goats, etc etc, but the game has turned into a spammy brawl fest that has made playing both tanks and supports quite miserable.All of this is just scratching the surface. I really can't recommend the game, let alone support Blizzard. Go play another shooter."

Green,0,August 11,17,,0,Not Recommended,As someone who played the original Overwatch beta all those years ago and bought it on release (even got the physical origins edition) its sad to see the state the game has been left in. Overwatch 1 was a great game for probably about its first two years and then Blizzard went really hard into competitive and esports when the game is the most fun in a casual environment. Then they decided to kill Overwatch 1 for this sequel which is really nothing more than a larger sized update. They have added basically nothing new except micro-transactions and questionable balance changes. Sadly they have also removed any sort of way to play the original. I hope one day fans can make some sort of way to play Overwatch 1 in its early years again. At least Mei is still cute.

We lost amazing team members, who really cared for this game, as a matter of fact most of the current members do really still care about the game, and it's future is, in the most part, out of their hands.Overwatch 2 should be a new and refreshed co-op version of the game with a bunch of repetable quest to develop the lore and give a better insight in the game story, and a skill tree to help creating new ways to play the game, simple as that.I miss 2017 overwatch"
Relic,0,August 22,9,,1,Not Recommended,"There are a lot of reviews about this game that don't really explain why everyone hates it so i'll do my best to explain it to people who are newer to this gameoverwatch 1 was an amazing game, one of my favorite games of all time. They had a controversial thing called lootboxes, which many people thought of as gambling, but what made it good was that everytime you leveled up, you got a lootbox. Which was always hypebut they replaced this with an awful battlepass. Somehow especially this season, they managed to make a bad mythic skin for their battlepass. This ana skin is beyond garbage, and the tier 1 version looks miles better than the last tier which doesn't really make any senseThey promised us with a huge pve aspect of the game, which was the whole point of overwatch 2. This was going to come later on a year or so after the games release. Nobody really liked that we had to wait, but were all hype for the eventual pve that we all thought was going to be amazing. Many people including me bought stuff thinking we would be able to use it in the pve, but turns out, it never was coming out. Blizzard knew it would not be possible when the game first came out, which they even admitted. This meant that they had people spend their money thinking they could use it in pve when Blizzard was just sitting back in a chair laughing at us knowing it was just all a scam. And yes, I think this is a scam. They led people on, knowing the only way they could get money was to lie to their fanbase. Which is why everyone has lost respect for this game and Blizzard. This game deserved to be review-bombed. Now that there is an actual way for people to give feedback about this game of course this was going to happen. Now, overwatch 2 is not the worst game out there like the reviews say. The gameplay in overwatch 1 was of course much better, and overwatch 2 is a downgrade. But it is still not horrible. If any of you reading this played total mayhem in overwatch 1, that is what overwatch 2 feels like. Everyone just is much harder to kill, and with 1 less tank, I think this is just worse and a lot less fun. It sucks they shut down overwatch 1 because i know almost everyone would rather go back to that. I dont think Blizzard can fix all these mistakes, and even though its sad, I think it may die in the coming years if its not dead already."

Most of the games are so boring to play and they are one sided. Either you are winning too easily or the enemy team annihilates you easily. Fun and tense matches where it feels that anyone can win until the last moment almost don't exist. Also game is unbalanced as well.Overwatch 1 was one of the best shooters ever made and it is shameful that this game even carries this name.Btw $15 for PvE? Seriously, there is an hour of content with no replayability and if it was ow1 that would be free (ow archives).There is nothing else to say what already hasn't been said. Shame on you Blizzard."

Jão,0,August 11,38,,1,Not Recommended,"Claramente era para ser apenas uma DLC do overwatch, deveria ser chamado Overwatch 1.2. Conseguiram piorar tudo que tinha de bom na primeira versão, a ganância com skins caríssimas, era melhor ter vendido o jogo e deixar os loots como eram em Overwatch 1. A Equipe está perdida sem saber o caminho certo para Overwatch, logo o jogo morrerá, sistema ridículo de punições, uma pena pois o primeiro era excelente."
Luden,0,August 12,5,,0,Not Recommended,"While every other review here is talking about the blatant money grab scam that is Overwatch 2, and those reviews are completely valid, I have a different bone to pick.I refuse to support a company that LAUGHS about the fact it's employees have reported gross SEXUAL misconduct, including sexual harassment and even assault.As well, I refuse to support a company that revokes someone's tournament winnings because they supported the Hong Kong protests. C'mon, how slimey can a company be that they're willing to go that far to keep their rich Chinese player base happy?♥♥♥♥ Blizzard. I hated this company before it was cool, just saying."
Geraldõ,4,August 13,17,12,10,Recommended,"This Game started off amazing. However just like this recent Null Sector event. As soon as Bill Cosby invaded the blizzard headquarters with his subliminal messaging to convert the developers and higher ups into committing the same atrocities just like Bill Cosby. I knew this game was over. Bill Cosby and his manager spiking the adrenochrome hunger thrist into the blizzard hq was as similar as Mr. Cosby spiking those they/thems drinks at bars and restaurants.              While this game had its ups and downs, I feel like overall there has been no support or updates in this game ever since Epstein unalived himself. Hmmm its possible all the kids on the island helped push this game into the amazing updates and past times I shared with my friends. But now like those kids, this games life is over and its going to take a lot help to replenish this games thirst for something fresh and new (of age) to bring this game back to life. Im excited to see what they are going to do for the future of this game and would love to play it as much as I did in the 90s. But untill then I am currently testing my limits and working on becoming more open to bi stuiff. I heard that helps enjoyment for this game."
xcrimsonlegendx,0,August 11,20,,0,Not Recommended,"Honestly Overwatch was a great game. But OW2 is just a cash grab. There are no meaningful updates from the OW1 base game, it was just an excuse to add a grossly overpriced cash shop and free-to-play monetization scheme. The PvP didn't benefit from the change, the PvE certainly didn't benefit, the players didn't benefit. The only benefit was to the developer who gets to rake in the profits from $20 skins and battlepasses galore. All they really did was take OW1 and smear it with a heaping helping of FOMO and greed, then shove it out the door and expect everyone to lap it up.Then to put icing on the cake they cut the PvE content that was promised, the entire reason anyone was excited for OW2 and chop it up into little pieces missing most of the features and sell them to us piecemeal. The negative reviews for the most part aren't a campaign to reviewbomb the game, they're the honest feelings of a community that has been done wrong time and time again who now have a platform to express their grievances."

TheSkyeLord,0,August 21,8,,7,Not Recommended,"I've only played this during Overwatch 2 as a friend got me into it, never touched OW1. I also have nearly 300 hours into the game (mostly on PS5 and a tiny bit on PC) when writing this. The game play is pretty fun, but man there are a lot of issues, like:- Forced 50/50 win rates. Can't I just play against people based on my skill/MMR level? Is it really that hard?- Competitive matchmaking just sucks. Why am I, who's in diamond, getting an all gold players team vs the enemy being all diamond players?- Where the f**k is the PvE mode?? I thought that was the whole point of this game coming out?- Monetization model is super awful (like, worse than CoD Advanced Warfare, how do y'all manage that???).- No looking for team, which makes the game feel pretty isolated unless you play with friends.- Terrible stats balancing, either the character is severely busted or outright unusable for most of the characters.And I'm sure there's more I could think of. I still have a fun time playing this game with friends but Blizzard really botched this game bad. I hope they try to fix the game and make it a lot better, but it feels too little to late. I don't wanna just pile on to the negative reviews the game already has, but it'll get a thumbs down from me due to Blizzard's blatant apathy and general disregard towards this game. It's been long known by a lot of Blizzard fans, but this game, along with other recent releases from them, really shows that Bluz is dead, and not what they used to be."

Maybe now that their failed OWL project is about to die, they'll start balancing the game for the 99.999% of the community instead of the pros.

																Do this instead of playing this game.Easy homemade chicken ramen, with a flavorful broth, roasted chicken, fresh veggies, lots of noodles, and a soft cooked egg. Inspired by traditional Japanese ramen, but on the table in under an hour.Ingredients2 chicken breasts (boneless, skin-on)*kosher salt and freshly-ground black pepper, to season1 Tbsp unsalted butter2 tsp sesame or vegetable oil2 tsp fresh ginger, minced1 Tbsp fresh garlic, minced3 Tbsp low-sodium soy sauce2 Tbsp mirin4 cups rich chicken stock1 oz dried shltаke mushrooms (or 1/2 cup fresh)1–2 tsp sea salt, to taste2 large eggs1/2 cup scallions, sliced2 (3 oz) packs dried ramen noodlesoptional: fresh jalapeño or chili slices, for servingInstructionsCOOK THE CHICKEN: ¹Preheat the oven to 375℉. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the oven, transfer the chicken to a plate, and cover with foil until ready to serve.MAKE THE RAMEN BROTH:Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for a few minutes until softened. Add the soy sauce and mirin, and stir to combine. Cook for another minute.Add the stock, cover, and bring to a boil. Remove the lid, and let simmer uncovered for 5 minutes, then add the dried mushrooms. Simmer gently for another 10 minutes, and season with salt, to taste.MAKE THE SOFT-BOILED EGGS:Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil. Gently lower the eggs (still cold from the fridge) into the boiling water, and let simmer for 7 minutes (for a slightly-runny yolk) or 8 minutes (for a soft, but set-up yolk).Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes, transfer the eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Wait at least 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then carefully peel away the shell and slice in half, lengthwise. Set aside until ready to serve.ASSEMBLE THE RAMEN BOWLS:Meanwhile, chop the scallions and jalapeño (if using). Slice the chicken into thin pieces. Set aside. When the eggs finish cooking, add the ramen noodles to the boiling water.Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two large bowls. Add the sliced chicken and the ramen broth. Top with the fresh scallions, jalapeño, and the soft boiled egg. Serve immediately. Enjoy!!"

																Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to crank up the volume and dive into a debate that will leave no room for doubt! DJ PROFESSOR K is here to make a bold statement: Jet Set Radio and TF2 are the real champions, while Overwatch 2... well, let's just say it falls short of the mark.Jet Set Radio, my friends, is a game that oozes style, originality, and pure rebellious spirit. It's a game that takes you on a wild ride through the streets of Tokyo-to, where you become a part of the GGs crew, skating, spraying graffiti, and sticking it to the man! The vibrant visuals, the infectious beats, and the freedom to express yourself make Jet Set Radio an unparalleled experience that keeps you coming back for more.Now, let's talk about Overwatch 2. Sure, it may have its flashy graphics and a dedicated fanbase, but let me ask you this: does it truly capture the essence of rebellion and individuality? Does it make you feel like you're part of something bigger, fighting against a monotonous world? I think not! Overwatch 2 may be a team-based shooter, but it lacks the soul, the heart, and the sheer audacity that Jet Set Radio brings to the table.And let's not forget about TF2, my friends! Team Fortress 2 is a timeless classic, a game that has stood the test of time and continues to captivate players with its unique characters, hilarious dialogue, and addictive gameplay. It's a game that embraces the wackiness, the humor, and the camaraderie that makes gaming truly special. TF2 knows how to keep you on your toes, how to make you laugh, and how to create a sense of community that Overwatch 2 simply can't match.So, my friends, if you're seeking a gaming experience that's vibrant, rebellious, and packed with personality, then it's time to put Overwatch 2 on the shelf and grab hold of Jet Set Radio and TF2! Let your creativity run wild, let your skills shine, and let the spirit of rebellion guide you to victory!DJ PROFESSOR K has spoken, and the verdict is clear. Jet Set Radio and TF2 are the games that will set your soul on fire, while Overwatch 2 falls flat in comparison. It's time to break free from the chains of conformity, my friends, and embrace the true spirit of gaming. So, grab your spray cans, lace up your skates, and let's paint the world with color, because in the battle between Jet Set Radio, TF2, and Overwatch 2, there's only one clear winner - the games that dare to defy the norm!"

Discount,0,August 11,10,,0,Not Recommended,"Been wanting to leave a negative review on this pile of trash since Overwatch 2's launch.Having stuck with the game for well over 6 years, the absolute mockery that Blizzard Entertainment have made of its entire playerbase is inexcusable. They see their customers only as wallets, and this game as a cow to be milked until it's dry and ready for slaughter.The egregious monetization present since the launch of the so-called ""sequel"" is what's driving this game into the dirt. The entire purpose of its existence, the massive PvE campaign it was supposed to have, has been scrapped in place of smaller missions costing $5 a pop at roughly 30 minutes playtime with zero replayability. Now they vow to ""re-commit"" to PvP, which is in its absolute worst state ever in terms of balancing, and characters locked behind paywalls at $9 each.This leaves Overwatch 2, in comparison to its predecessor, as a worthless money-grabbing shop update with changes to the core gameplay that only make it worse.Don't even bother. It's over.I've done my part!P.S. I dearly hope the art, animation, and writing teams for the game's story and cinematics can be hired onto a project they're passionate about, one that isn't careening into the Pacific."

Master of Weirdos,1,August 11,5,,0,Not Recommended,"I used to like playing overwatch back in the day, when the game was made to be fun, when there were developers who actually loved their own creation. Now they not only didn't released this game with everything they promised, but they made this game extremely competitive by making it 5v5 and removing flexibility of picking more than 2 classes of DPS or support, which makes the game extremely frustrating, unfun and team dependent (I actually lost a friend because he raged at me so much for not doing too well that day.) They basically turned this game into money laundering machine, they hid new heroes and game modes behind paywall. It's twisted by e-sporters so they get even more money from t-shirts, pins, keychains and other ♥♥♥♥. Talking about this kind of things, everything in there is extremely overpriced. Skins, battle pass, cosmetics. Did you know that irl charms/keychains cost less than virtual ones? LMFAO! Pathetic company. I'm not even gonna mention about the ♥♥♥♥ Blizzard pulled out with sexual harassions and bootlicking Chinese government. You either have to be delusional or be paid to support this ♥♥♥♥. I'm glad they finally came to steam. Btw, your game is not being review bombed, it's being hit by reality. The reality in which the fans who loved this game got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the ass with no rubber on and now are really really angry because their ass hurts (altho I've meet people who don't mind, God help them). I hope blizzard sees this and realizes how much they ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up. Or maybe this review will be removed just like every mention of Taiwan in their games, LOL!Have a nice day."

Never understood why they added a 2 to the title when there is nothing about this that makes it any different than the original except this one has a battle pass. I guess there was supposed to be a story mode, but they canceled that? The biggest selling point of the sequel in my opinion, and they removed it. It's just overwatch but 5v5 instead of 6v6. I only really played it again because I saw it was on Steam and felt like playing a few rounds."
Venky BSc,0,August 12,11,,22,Not Recommended,"Overwatch 2 was supposed to be the sequel we were all eagerly waiting for, a chance for Blizzard to make amends for the missteps of the past and truly deliver on their promises. But what we got instead was a bitter disappointment that left me feeling completely ripped off.I had invested time and money into the original Overwatch, believing in Blizzard's commitment to the community. When they announced Overwatch 2, I was cautiously excited, hoping they would deliver on their promise of a free PvE mode to make up for the initial investment in the first game. However, they pulled a complete 180, charging us for content they once assured us would be complimentary.Microtransactions run rampant in Overwatch 2, turning a game that once celebrated fair in-game purchases into a cash-grabbing nightmare. The constant push to buy cosmetics and loot boxes has cheapened the experience and made it clear that Blizzard's focus is on squeezing every last penny out of players.But the biggest betrayal has been the lack of respect for loyal fans. We stood by Blizzard through thick and thin, only to be slapped in the face with a game that not only fails to meet expectations but also feels like a blatant cash grab. Closing down the original Overwatch was bad enough, but to then charge us for content we were initially promised for free is a new low.I can't recommend Overwatch 2 in its current state. It's a sad reminder of how a once-great franchise can crumble when greed takes over. I feel like a pawn in Blizzard's money-making scheme, and it's disheartening to see a game that was once beloved fall so far. Save your money and find a developer that respects their players more than their profits."

Blizzard killed my favorite game behind the back alley, took a piss on the corpse and then decided to wear it as a skinsuit, now pretending to be the once great game.

hee ho,0,August 11,6,,56,Not Recommended,"It's a game.Thoughts on Overwatch 2: InvasionThe paid story missions should have been free, they're barebones and the plot is extremely scarce. There's potential there but it ends extremely quickly. As soon as you press the purchase button, you'll regret actually buying it. With the monetization they're doing, it's extremely scummy to also ask for money for story missions when there's also $20 dollar skins in the shop. Especially when the OW community has been waiting years for story missions. At the end of the 3 short missions, it has the audacity to ask you to upgrade your intial Invasion pack to the ultimate version. I feel like there should be some sort of apology to players who expected things from Blizzard but there will never be compensation or actual love towards the game, it's players or their own developers. At the least, I can only show love to the art team and past developers who have worked tirelessly only for Blizzard to throw that passion away.Overwatch 2?Overwatch is still a fun game despite the move to 5v5. There are a lot of problems and issues but if you want some quick fun, it's still Overwatch at the end of the day. The new player grind as a free-to-play is quite daunting though. I don't think they should time gate heroes for 32(?)+ games . (You have to win those games too so that'll be a while before you actually unlock everyone) I don't think it's pay-to-win and more so pay-for-convenience since you can actually unlock those characters for free. The main monetization draw are the skins and battle pass. The legendary shop skins are at a ludicrous 20 dollars, which is insane especially when it's for 1 character. Free to Play experienceSo, how free is it? You can get 60 coins per week. Don't expect to get anything as a free-to-play player. Pay up. I think the whole system is a step down from what was in OW1 which is the universal opinion right now. It focuses too much on FOMO and tries to lure you to the shop to buy things. It's decent if you want to play but if you want cosmetics be prepared to cough up money. FlashpointI want to say that it's on par with Push. Not too great or too bad. It's a mediocre game mode that can get confusing really quickly because of the large map and rotating spawns. Both maps have similar colors to me which kinda makes it feel like they're all 1 map. I still need to play more to get a good grasp of things but it's kinda middling right now.Final thoughtsI have lots of love towards Overwatch but I wish they could get their ♥♥♥♥ together for once. I love the game and everything about it but there are too many issues to actually recommend anyone this game with my full confidence. Maybe in the future when they tone down all this stuff, eh probably not it's Blizzard. 🫢🤮🤮🤮🤮"

People said that PVE = Archive missions 2.0 but they're wrong it's archive missions 1.1It's so sad to see a huge potential being wasted to make fast and easy money without thinking of the long term.Just avoid this game. Go play another game."
Malakai*,0,August 12,8,,0,Not Recommended,"I'm glad to see the overwhelming negative reviews because this is exactly what Activision/Blizzard have been building up to in the latest years. Overwatch 2 it's barely an expansion more than a sequel and a downgrade in many other ways, along the broken promises.I've never been an Overwatch fan but I've been playing ocassionally since the first one. It's a decent casual game but to me it has always felt like one of those games that gets worse and worse the more you play it and how it's been handled only made that more evident.To me, it just lacks depth, the visuals design is rather terrible when it comes to visual clarity (huge ass weapon viewmodels, flashing lights all over, colorful maps that make the characters blend so they had to add an outline to everyone) and just boring encounters due to the healing and shields. Also, it has always felt like this team requires almost TOO much teamplay which means that playing with randoms is gonna be pure suffering for the most part.Another thing that never liked honestly is the ""sanitized"" aesthetic and characters which some people like but I've always thought that they were terribly lame and corporate which is sorta confirmed the moment we knew there was a diversity chart to build them. OW2 is just all of that once again, but now with a sorry excuse of a PvE mode and terrible monetization with skins that don't even look good compared to the ones they had previously. Game feels polished and runs incredibly well but does that matter when it's not that fun and it's being handled like this?"
eco🔰chocolatcchi,0,August 11,11,,0,Not Recommended,"I don't care about the PVE content fiasco. Each ""limited time"" PVE event they did so far was middling at best. Still a horribly mismanaged live service title that was far more enjoyable in its first year than now. Its not exactly that I disagreed with the game's vision, but more so OW had years of number adjustment balance patches all done by a balance team with obviously didn't play the game outside of ""work"". I don't like MOBAs so my hot/cold take is that the 24 at launch was more than enough heroes, we didn't need a content dripfeed where we'll get at least two heroes between every new map.The big positives is the hit detection and overbearing moderation were annoying for 2016 standards, but compared to the cuckholding experience of modern FPS titles its not all too bad, people can still release some ""steam"" in chat. I also hit 165fps @1440p stable on my ancient PC so the optimization team deserves some credit."
Sunrie,0,August 11,18,,0,Not Recommended,"Let's be honest...people who make OW porn work WAY harder on what they do than the developers do. Blizzard is more interested in ""The Message™"" than they are on making a good game, and even more than that, they're interested in squeezing every dime out of low IQ players. Don't be a low IQ player and buy the battlepass, which is amazingly more predatory than loot boxes ever were.The game is horribly unbalanced, the community is more toxic than the GTA community and CoD community COMBINED, and the SBMM will ensure that you have the worst experience playing the game. SBM isn't there to ensure you have a ""fair and balanced"" experience, it's there to ensure you're always going to sweat your brains out and rage."

Stay at the very least 50 meters away from a copy of this game, in fact. while Overwatch 1 may have been fun to play sometimes (not even all times), this game just sucks, plain and simple. This is mostly due to the developers and CEO Bobby Kotick's literal incompetency at managing this ""game"" unfortunately.-the PvE was promised in 2019 was cancelled and blizzard only told us in 2023 and knew it was CANCELLED before OW2 was even released in the first place, back in October 5th 2022-the """"""PvE"""""" that was given to us has a total of 102 minutes of content over three ""missions"" when you pay ~15€ for it, and you'll have to keep paying to get the other missions. this means for three batches of these missions you'll pay a total of 45€ after three seasons IF you only buy the missions and no battle passes, almost as much as a normal AAA game with a full blown story mode, while for that much you get 5 hours not including cut-scenes.-the """"""PvE"""""" missions which as mentioned previously you HAVE TO PAY FOR are literally comparable to the previous archive events shown in previous events in Overwatch 1, with the exception that those were FREE OF CHARGE, as they should've been in the first place seeing as they are linear and the AI of the enemies (and teammates if you are playing with bots) is dumber than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ brick-heroes, which is something pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ useful to be available in a HERO BASED 1ST PERSON SHOOTER, are locked behind an impossible grind or you can just use money to unlock with premium battle passes.-the shift from a loot box system which you could earn to a battle pass you must PAY to have-the lack of ANY premium currency in said battle pass, making it so you need to pay every season actual money for the battle pass, unlike damn near every game that has a battle pass nowadays. if fortnite does it better than you, then you messed up-skins which were originally a small grind to do now take over 400 years to unlock them all. Or, if you'd prefer, you can simply hand Blizzard OVER TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO UNLOCK THEM-balancing in this game is pretty much non-existent, with new heroes (which as mentioned above, are locked behind the battle pass) being overwhelmingly powerful against almost any other hero, while others get hit with the nerf hammer harder than anything-the competitive scene is literally being destroyed by Blizzard since it started losing money, so ♥♥♥♥ it might as well nuke it into oblivion-despite the terrible ""attempts"" blizzard did to stomp out the toxicity in this game, the game is still a toxic wasteland comparable to league of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ legends-the game heavily encourages counter-picking heroes over actual skill, which can be annoying if you're really good with a specific hero and the enemy team chooses the hard counter then you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥. this means the game HEAVILY encourages you being a Jack of all Trades instead of just playing with a hero you may like and/or play better with.Blizzard does not care for the game as it is plainly obvious. Just stay away from this ""game"", if you can even call it that. this isn't a game. its a poor attempt at an update disguised as a game by Blizzard to get off a controversy back in 2019 when Blitzchung was kicked off a Heartstone tournament by siding with Hong Kong during the protests at the time, and nowadays a poor attempt at getting to your wallet. go play almost literally anything else and i guarantee you'll have a better time with it than with this lazy, poor attempt at reviving a game that became a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ attempt at a cash grab. this is Diablo Immortal all over again, but Blizzard is trying to be just a tiny bit less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shameless than with that poor excuse for a ""sequel"". just do not get anywhere near close this thing."
bidiBuzz,0,August 13,6,,10,Not Recommended,"In 2014 when the first cinematic of Overwatch came out, I immediatly fell in love with this future IP. Beautiful, heroes, story and Ideas! Blizzard was going to make another masterclass of a game, and oh boy, what a game. In may 2016, when the game released I was overhyped, I even take a day out sick of school to play it all day long. That was amazing. Yes, lootbox system, it was feeling weird in a Blizzard game. That wasn't much of an issue to be honest. I then spent those last 7 years playing a lot of Overwatch (roughly 5000 hours). I got myself into esport in my country and it was beautiful I was enjoying the game so much even though he had some pretty important problem of balancing. In 2017 I started to dream of a campaign for such a game, Imagine ? That could be so f***** awesome no ?. And boom 2 years later ow2 is announced with all the PVE part. story mission, hero mission, new gamemodes, new maps, new characters. That was incredible, I was so hyped, and so confident into team 4. They did an amazing work on the pvp, and what they started to show us was really promising. Then we got asked to wait, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 3. 75 years... We had promicies, we had hope and we had the envy to discover that. Well, kinda delusional isn't it ? I will never say that they lied to us, because they didn't, Jeff and his team didn't lie to us they were really gonna bring us what they told us, I'm sure about that. The thing is, everyone left, Jeff and almost his whole crew of amazing devs left the ship. We lost a lot with thoses departures. we lost the vision of the game, talented creators, we lost hope... The actual devs are doing an amazing work, they are doing what they are tasked and they are doing it beautifully, but I'm sure they want to show us more. As a 3D artist myself, I know how passionate we are when we are on a project, all the hours of work we put to deliver something big, for people that will play it, or watch it just because we want to make them dream. It's a job of passion so I don't doubt a second. INVASIONInvasion? Well, at first I was positively surprised, new amazing maps, new amazing character, a sort of archive mission for free, this new progression system and those 3 story missions... Well i was waiting for a campaign no ? Cool, I guess I'll buy them and see what it is apparently it's not that bad, right ? Mmmmmh... The issue is that those missions are the missions team 4 was working on back in 2019 as tests. First mission, Rio well cool little mission no ? It's exactly the same mission than the one people in blizzcon 2019 had the chance to play, but without the little talent tree thing. Back then, players said to dev that it was fun but it was still a bit to simple, and they aggreed. So why we have access to less good than this experience today, august 2023 ? I'm gonna be honest, I enjoyed my time playing this missions and watching those new little cutscenes during the experience, it was fun. Some stuff is terrible though, AI is horrible and overall effort of presentation is less good than last archives missions. But the worst is that we have to pay 15 bucks for theses unfinished missions, because I'm sorry, they look like they are finished but they aren't. Devs had to use stuff that was in test in 2019, clean up in a hurry and throw it in the game to make people pay 15 bucks... and now ? Well we have to wait again, we don't even know how long, for the next chapter, whiches the one we saw in blizzcon 2021... So again, it's probably done already even if they have to polish the experience. i'm really sad with what this amazing IP has become. At the moment the game is actually good, pve is quite fun even though you'll probably only play it once, pvp is good, with nice balancing, nice new maps and nice new heroes, so it's fine, but this whole Idea of monetizing every bit of the game... it sickens me... Once again, I still believe the devs are doing a great job. But the decisions taken by Blizzard are hurting. They hurt their players, their employees and soon their precious investors. As a great man once said : ""Never accept the world as it appears to be, dare to see it for what it could be."""

Look for one that says ""high ethyl ether content"", such as PrestoneEphedrine The cottons in todays vicks nasle inhalers dont contain efed or pfed (ephedrin or psuedoephedrin) but there are still lots of easy ways to get good ephed or pfed, pure ephedrin can be extracted out of it's plant matter, from a plant that can be bought at most garden stores. Or you can get pfed from decongestive pills like sudafed. Most people perfer to work with pfed from pills rather then ephed from the plant. The important thing is that you must have pure pfed/ephed as any contaminants will ♥♥♥♥ up the molar ratio leaving you with over-reduced ♥♥♥♥ or under-reduced ♥♥♥♥. Or contaminats will jell durring baseifying and gak up your product which will then be very hard to clean. So you want to find a pill that is nearly pure pfed hcl, or as close to pure as you can get. Also check the lable on your pills and see what inactive ingredients they contain. Inactive ingredients are things like binders and flavors. These you dont want and will remove when cleaning your pills. but certain inactive ingredients are harder to remove then others. You dont want pills with a red coating, you dont want pills with alot of cellose in them and you dont want pills with much wax. you also dont want pills that contain povidone. As a rule, if you have a two pills that contain the same amount of pfed hcl then take the smaller sized pill because it obviously has less binders and inactive ingredients, time released pills are usualy harder to work with because they have more binders and tend to gel up durring the a/b stage. Also only buy pills that have pfed hcl as the only active ingredient. You first have to make ephedrine (which is sometimes sold as meth by itself):If you are selling it...I would just make ephedrine and say it's meth.Distilled water - it's really cheap, so you have no reason to use the nasty stuff from the tap. Do things right.List of equipment : A glass eyedropperThree small glass bottles with lids (approx. 3 oz., but not important)one should be marked at 1.5oz, use tape on the outside to mark it (you might want to label it as ether). One should be clear (and it can't be the marked one).A Pyrex dish (the meatloaf one is suggested)A glass quart jarSharp scissorsClean rubber glovesCoffee filtersA measuring cupMeasuring spoonsPreparing your Lab:Preparing Ethyl Ether: WARNING: Ethyl Ether is very flammable and is heavier than air. Do not use ethyl ether near flame or non-sparkless motors. It is also an anaesthetic and can cause respiratory collapse if you inhale too much.Take the unmarked small bottle and spray starter fluid in it until it looks half-full. Then fill the rest of the way with water, cap the bottle and shake for 5 minutes. Let it sit for a minute or two, and tap the side to try and separate the clear upper layer. Then, draw off the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, and throw away the lower (water) and cloudy layer. Place the ether in the marked container. Repeat this until you have about 1.5 oz. of ether. Put the cap on it, and put it in the freezer if you can. Rinse the other bottle and let it stand.Ethyl ether is very pungent. Even a small evaporated amount is quite noticeable.Ephedrine & or P-Ephedrine: Please discuss this on the neonjoint forum5. Pour 1/8 teaspoon of the lye crystals into the bottle of ephedrine and agitate. Do this carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air, avoid any flames as usual. Repeat this step until the mixture remains cloudy. This step neutralizes the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluble free base (l-desoxyephedrine) again. Why do we do this? So that we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities. For 3 oz. bottles, this should take only 3 repetitions or so.6. Fill the bottle from step 5 up the rest of the way with ethyl ether. Cap the bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes. It is very important to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible. This will cause the free base to dissolve into the ether (it -is- soluble in ether).7. Let the mixture settle. There will be a middle layer that is very thick. Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thin as possible. This is why this bottle should be clear.8. Remove the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, being careful not to get any of the middle layer in it. Place the removed ether layer into a third bottle.9. Add to the third bottle enough water to fill it half-way and about 5 drops of muriatic acid. Cap it. Shake the bottle for 2 minutes. When it settles, remove the top layer and throw it away. The free base has now been bonded to the HCl again, forming a water soluble salt. This time, we're getting rid of ether-soluble impurities. Make sure to get rid of all the ether before going to step 11!10. If there is anything left from step 3, repeat the procedure with it.11. Evaporate the solution in the Pyrex dish on low heat. You can do this on the stove or nuke it in the microwave (be careful of splashing), but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater (like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the remaining crystals will be ephedrine HCl.If you microwave it, I suggest no more than 5-10s at one time. If it starts ""popping"", that means you have too little liquid left to microwave. You can put it under a bright (100W) lamp instead. Microwaving can result in uneven heating, anyway.First Batch: 120mg ephedrine HClEstimated: 300mg (100% of theoretical, disregarding HCl)Now, Making Methamphetamine out of ephedrine by reducing it with Hydroiodic Acid and Red Phosphorus.Items needed: Alot of matchbooks (the kind with the striking pad)Coffee filters (or filter paper)Something that measures ml and gramsA flask (a small pot with a lid can be used)iodineHydroiodic Acid (I will tell you how to make this)Red Phosphorus (I will tell you how to make this)Lye*Optional (toluene and HCI gas)Making Red Phosphorus: The striking pad on books of matches is about 50% red phosphorus. The determined experimenter could obtain a pile of red phosphorus by scraping off the striking pads of matchbooks with a sharp knife. A typical composition of the striking pad is about 50% red phosphorus, along with about 30% antimony sulfide, and lesser amounts of glue, iron oxide, MnO2, and glass powder. I don't think these contaminants will seriously interfere with the reaction. Naturally, it is a tedious process to get large amounts of red phosphorus by scraping the striking pads off matchbooks, but who cares?Making Hydroiodic Acid: This is made by mixing iodine and red phosphorus. When making hydroiodic acid from iodine and red phosphorus, the acid is prepared first, and allowed to come to complete reaction for 20 minutes before adding the ephedrine to it. The way around the roadblock here is to just boil off some more of the water from the ephedrine extract, and make the acid mixture in fresh pure water. Since the production of HI from iodine and red phosphorus gives off a good deal of heat, it is wise to chill the mixture in ice, and slowly add the iodine crystals to the red phosphorus-water mixture.Now, Making Methamphetamine: To do the reaction, a 1000 ml round bottom flask is filled with 150 grams of ephedrine. Also added to the flask are 40 grams of red phosphorus and 340 ml of 47% hydroiodic acid. This same acid and red phosphorus mixture can be prepared from adding 150 grams of iodine crystals to 150 grams of red phosphorus in 300 ml"

It's a sequel in the sense that they just added a 2 to the end of the game and made content drops more infrequent.

Dision,0,August 14,6,,0,Not Recommended,"I used to be a big fan of Overwatch back when it was an actual game and not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ service.My story with Overwatch began in 2017 with the Anniversary. I only knew Team Fortress 2 and didn't have any interest in Overwatch until a friend convinced me to give it a chance during the free weekend of the Anniversary event. I immediately fell in love with the game, just everything: The gameplay, the sound design, the characters, the graphics, the high skill ceiling for many of the heroes. I was somewhat lost for a regular game and at this moment I found it in Overwatch. I remember spending the following nights awake playing Overwatch just because it was so much fun for me. I still remember being dead tired on Volskaya playing Widowmaker at like 5 AM. I was addicted in the best way possible.Over the years we gathered more and more players amongst our group of friends. Sometimes we'd only queue with two people, sometimes with a full team. I used to play every evening after coming home from school and later university. Overwatch was with me through a large portion of my life and with Overwatch I got my girlfriend into PC gaming. Even when other friends left the game for a while, they would return sooner or later, in Overwatch we had something like a mutual home. And even when everyone was playing something else, I still played Overwatch with my girlfriend almost everyday. I amassed something around 800 hours and had a silver potrait. Sometimes I got bored and thought to myself, I should at least get a gold portrait before leaving the game entirely someday. I also got into ranked with time but never spent as much time on it as I wanted to - too little motivation, too little time. But I felt like the game was the best when either you were playing with friends or you were tryharding your butt off in competitive. And I will never forget the countless hours I spent playing 3v3 with my friends, even having an 11 game winstreak once. I remember us grinding the coop stuff like ""Junkenstein's Revenge"" and the archives missions for hours on end. I knew and somewhat loved almost every character and was able to play them in a presentable manner. Hitscan heroes were my favorites and I became an Ana OTP with time peaking high plat with the little time I actually spent grinding, wish I played more. With time I even invested time into watching the Overwatch League with the San Francisco Shock becoming my favorite team after witnessing their win over Soeul Dynasty in 2020. The team consisting of players I all liked, legends like ANS and the streamer Super. Overwatch 1 was the sole reason I upgraded my PC. At university for becoming a teacher I even made a video presenting ways to utilize Overwatch for language learning.So, I stopped playing when Overwatch 2 launched. I still vividly remember the last ranked game of Overwatch 1 I played on Blizzard World and my last game in general on Lijiang Tower sitting in Discord with my group of friends. I remember everything being shutdown and people typing stuff like ""Love you all"", ""See you on the other side"" in the general chat. Overwatch 2 came and I just didn't want to play anymore, I just hated almost everything about it. And so did my friends. All of us moved on from the game, none of us are playing it anymore, all since Overwatch 2. I'm sure somewhere in there, the game is still fun but we just don't feel it anymore. Amongst the thing we absolutely hate are:-The monetization being changed to battle passes and overpriced shops (Lootboxes were a lot more fair to consumers)-The UI losing its personality (including stuff like the ""On Fire""-Mechanic, the symbols for ranks, the player portraits and so much more)-The balancing and change to 5 Players (Game just feels different, feels bad and unfun. And yes, I loved playing Reinhardt Zarya with my gf)-The fact that they basically cancelled the PvE they promised, making the idea of ""Overwatch 2"" obsolete-The change to free to play-Not being able to see progress made in Overwatch 1 (like prior ranked seasons and stuff like that)There are probably twenty more things I could say that I despise about Overwatch 2 but the one thing I hate the most and the one reason I even care about all of this is that they took Overwatch 1 away for this. The very product we paid money for and learned to love was taken away and replaced with this abomination of a service. After Overwatch 2, I never really touched the game again and just dropped it, just like my friends. We all just accepted Overwatch to be dead and moved on. We transitioned to other games, especially League of Legends but still have not yet found another game to include us all like Overwatch 1 did. Seeing gameplay of Overwatch 1 now just hurts because I guess we did not really understand and appreciate what we really had.So, why did I write this review and why do I have 0.4 hours in the game on Steam? I wanted to write part of my story down and share it with everyone and do my part in leaving a negative review. The reason I have 0.4 hours is because I left the gaming running while taking a massive dump, thinking about how much I hate this game. Unless we get Overwatch 1 back or some sort of ""Overwatch Classic"", I will not return. ♥♥♥♥ you, Blizzard"
AuraPSX,0,August 11,7,,0,Not Recommended,"Been a player since Overwatch released and I'm just here to leave my negative review because there finally is a way for me to voice my dissatisfaction with the absolute disappointment and mess that Blizzard made of Overwatch.I have never seen a developer not just ruin their reputation, but entirely fumble one of the best Multiplayer games to release in the last years this hard.Overwatch 2 is a complete downgrade of Overwatch 1 in almost every way:- Everything is locked behind a Battlepass with the design being based on FOMO so that you buy into it.- No more lootboxes, all of your lootboxes get/got opened and the only way to get anything in the game now is from the Battlepass tracks, or to grind for the near-useless ingame currency that takes you 100 hours of play to even unlock a basic skin.- Matches have been changes from the classic 6v6 to 5v5 and cut one tank from each Team, making the game a lot more boringAnd there are plenty more issues that I haven't bothered to type here and/or document because I'm quite honestly just done with Overwatch as a whole. I'll probably play a few hours on the Steam Version just to see of the changes made since the Overwatch 2's """"""launch"""""" but I doubt my mind will be changed much. If at all."

NotYourWaifu,0,September 1,18,,0,Not Recommended,"You might think people are review bombing OW2 on Steam but it is far from truth. While it seems like it, it is a silenced voice of many people that were (and still are) dissatisfied with Blizzard-Activision policy of censorship and development. These voices and negative opinions were present for many years, but Blizz are very good at buying reviews, deleting negative ones and not letting anything even mildly negative stay on their forums for more than a few hours. That's called censorship and this corporation is very good at doing it, starting from Diablo 3 or even earlier. Negative opinions about Overwatch have been present for years, they just kept being swept under the carpet, so people that are not familiar with it could see only good reviews and then buy/try it and perhaps leave some more $$$ in the form of microtransactions.I have more than 3000h played in OW1. It was a blast back in 2016/2017. I really enjoyed this game even when i kept losing, and losing a lot since i'm not that good at shooter games. But when you like something even constant losing can't stop you from having fun. But now i can't really force myself to play it. It sucks. I don't mind racist, trans/homophobes, afker and toxic people that will make your day worse - i had long experience playing multiplayer games and i'm somewhat thick-skinned when it comes to ""loud people"" in pvp games. They exist and not even big price tag will make them disapppear. But the game is just not the same - it lost its shine and individuality. It shouldn't be an issue if you never tried Overwatch since you have nothing to compare to. You definitely can have fun in Overwatch 2. It is game worth trying especially now that it is free to play. Game wise it hasn't changed its core that much for all these years and i bet a lot of people could enjoy it. On top of that they seems very progressive and supporting LGBTQIA+ (personally i don't like it - companies that are keep making poor decisions shield themselves with being pride-friendly to keep people(and their money) in game but proceeding with poor choices that are rainbowcolored. In the end it seems like it is bad for game development and for LGBTQIA+ community in the long-run since we can't know for sure if they really support this community or is it just to get more cash from rainbow-painted facade). Like...do they support LGBTQIA+ in the middle-east? Why they don't fight for their rights there if they are so pride-supportive?I recommend you to try OW2, you might enjoy the game but watch out for toxic people. Play with friends for better experience. I personally lost any interest in this game. They hide their past mistakes by adding ""2"" to the title promoting it like it is completely new game, switching grindable lootboxes for real-cash only battle pass pissing on their loyal but poor part of community and abandoning overwatch league cause it is not profitable anymore (insert toy story ""i don't want to play with you anymore"" meme)Blizzard-Activision is not worth supporting my dudes - they are getting worse and worse with each and every next big decision they make. Sad to see, but maybe it is time for new king of video games?Oh, and don't forget about 2019-2021 Blizzard sexual harassment lawsuit[knowyourmeme.com]. Internet remembers."

♡RoxyPaw♡,0,August 11,5,,0,Not Recommended,"I have played this game since Season 3 of the Original Overwatch. I was absolutely in love with the game, the changes, the new heroes, the small PvE events we got and I loved that the Lootboxes were optional in terms of whether you'd buy them with real life currency, or play the game, level up, and get lootboxes that way. I loved the entire mechanic of it, free lootboxes, level system, the rank system wasn't absolute gopshite and people genuinely enjoyed the game, even when raging, being toxic and what else you can expect in a competitive game.What ruined this entire game, was the content drought, the empty promises of a seperate game named ""Overwatch 2"" that would be PvE only, for us PvE andies to enjoy without ruining the aspect of the actual PvP game we all know and love.We all believed that they would keep their promise of making this huge, openworld-ish, amazing skill-tree PvE and we were all EXCITED for it. I, like many others, bought the Pre-Release game pass/DLC/whatever you want to call it at this rate, in hopes that my money would go into making that and like many others, I was severely let down when Blizzard announced Overwatch 2.It was Overwatch, but no level system, no lootboxes, no new conent besides for updated graphics and one less teammate in the game's gamemodes. That was all we were getting at the start. Then, a year of nothing later, get bombed with ""We're cancelling it, sorry guys bye"" and that was it.Due to the huge backlash, they've now decided to release these tiny PvE events and new weird hero level systems that are merely a bandaid ontop of a large flesh wound that really isn't doing anything to fix what they did. Also, the Battlepass. I don't even wanna f*cking talk about that.And that's just ONE of the ""Big Game Company"" Activision Blizzard's Games, without actually going into the whole mess that is the Company itself.

StarryLuna,0,August 16,5,,0,Not Recommended,"I've played Overwatch from 2017 and reached Grandmaster rank on Competitive, so I want to take my frustration in this space. (Still playing on battle.net, but trying the Steam one just for reviewing it)I don't know what Blizzard think. If they want to put ""2"" in title for just making it 5v5 and free to play, sure. But don't give us a false hope on PvE content. The hype in that number ""2"" was the promising PvE, and now what we've got? Invasion? the one that's good in it just the cinematic cutscenes.I still play this just because I have friends to play with. But I DO NOT recommend this at all for people who wants some lore or story that they PROMISED. just enjoy the cinematic, comic and such. but the game? if it's competitive one that you want, sure, go on. But if you come to play for lore and such, Blizzard already let us down.And don't make me started about reward system and cosmetics. I miss loot boxes that gave us the feeling that the game gave us rewards of playing it. Now? God... nothing to reward you, how hard you play, how you want to queue that role that is short of players (often tanks). just 'exp for battle pass' bs. Oh, and the coins for weekly.. the only thing that can make us get BP for free is to play almost 2 seasons of OW with all weekly done. Even after buying with real money for 10 USD, there is some.. emptiness. It feels pointless except if you really REAAAALLLY want to get that mythic skin on BP. It feels not rewarding, the lies, the frustration. name it all. Overwatch has it.Once more for TLDR: If you want to play for competitive, go on, you can try, just make sure to look at patch notes, your main hero at some point can be really OP and be really weak. If you want lore, forget it, enjoy the cinematic shorts, comics and short stories, don't hope for the game. they don't care about putting the story on the game properly, just the cash."

Makima,0,August 11,6,,1,Not Recommended,"Alright, let's actually provide a constructive review. Why are people ""review bombing"" Overwatch 2?We paid for Overwatch, we supported it throughout its lifespan, it was popular and liked by its community, and turning a happy profit each year.When Blizzard announced Overwatch 2, the big new feature they announced, the entire premise that made it ""worth the sequel treatment"" was the PvE campaign mode. Hero talent trees, customizable abilities, an expansive co-op campaign that would add to the story and lore. We were told it was going to be so much work that they wouldn't be putting out updates for Overwatch any more, they were re-allocating the staff to work on this new project.With no updates, and no content, Overwatch started to get stale... people grew tired and bored, spending less time in the game, or moving on. Many of us stuck with the product, playing a little each week just to keep fresh... waiting for the new campaign mode. For a lot of us, playing became a chore, something we were doing out of habit, so we'd be ready for the new campaign...But the new campaign wasn't the premise that established OW2, it was the pretext. It was a lie. Blizzard abandoned the PvE campaign a full YEAR before OW2 launched - but continued to push it in marketing as the big new feature. It's even in the announcement trailer for OW2, and on the roadmaps. They knew they'd canned it 12 months earlier, but they knew that's what people wanted, so kept putting it front and centre to get people's money, to get people to buy into the project. They took our trust and monetized it.-----What does OW2 ACTUALLY offer then? What did they work on for those two years that was so important that they couldn't make content for OW1, the product people paid for and were supporting?1) They overhauled the graphical engine:Before, Overwatch would play on a relatively low spec computer, and it'd be smooth. Now, it stutters and stammers in the menus. They've added this weird shiny plastic finish to everything in the world, heroes and environment alike - so where before, heros would ""pop"" against the background and be easy to follow, now everything has the same texture to it, and it all merges together into visual noise - especially at longer ranges. They've compensated for how bad this looks by adding lots of additional flashy effects and explosions, that makes it much harder to see anything amidst the chaos. A PvP game at this pace relies heavily on quick disambiguation of what you're looking at, so you can react and compete, and the new engine makes this impossible without turning all the effects back off... meaning that the two years of development is for a feature best disabled.The new engine also has a weird slippery ""feel"" to it. Reviewers who'd played Overwatch for 50 hours came into Overwatch 2 and reported ""look! it's the same Overwatch you love, but it's F2P now! Just ignore the monetization and you can play this great game for free!"" Established long term players with thousands of hours were on reddit complaining that their hitboxes were all over the place and shots that would previously ""feel"" like a dead certain hit were just completely whiffing, and they didn't understand why. All the timings are messed up.2) They reworked most of the heroes:TLDR: they screwed up the game balance. Previously, one of the biggest appeals of Overwatch was that you could find a hero that suited your play style, and main them, getting good at whatever suited you best. Some people like sniping, or hitscan run and gun, some people aren't good at reactionary aim and instead liked to focus on positioning, tactics and strategy. You could make a big positive different to your team by playing lucio or mercy, and paying attention to your surroundings, and positioning yourself in the right place at the right time to make the difference.With Overwatch 2, the damage and healing behaviour has been reworked heavily. Now, the one tank on the team is insanely chunky, and it's near impossible to kill them quickly - with healer support, they can just stand in the line of fire and laugh. Everyone else dies almost immediately, regardless of who their aggressor is.Team-fighting now is very one-note, you have one tank who's immortal if they have support, and you have four hitscan DPS characters following them - there's not a lot of difference between supports and DPS characters. The teams try to pick off the other team's DPS/Support characters, and when they pick a few off, they can finish the tank and take the objective. Repeat. There's no room for variation in play style at all, you either play a DPS and try to kill the other team DPS, or you play a tank, and try to position correctly - maybe picking off an enemy hero that gets too close to you.I understand a lot of this came from feedback at the professional levels, where support players were complaining that they wanted to have more direct impact in teamfights, they wanted the game to feel more like other FPS games - but for a large portion of Overwatch's playerbase specifically, the appeal of the game was that you could do something else and still matter.3. They got INCREDIBLY greedy with the monetization...It's a longstanding argument that lootboxes are terrible in modern gaming... but Overwatch was one of the few examples of Lootboxes done right. Most of the long-term players of the game actually liked the system, that just rewarded you for playing the game and let you unlock whatever content you wanted relatively quickly. I started playing OW1 with the first anniversary, cleared the weekly boxes from arcade every week, and at the launch of OW2, I owned every single item in the game. Those who didn't have the time to invest in doing everything could still quickly unlock specific items they wanted (and let's be honest, when you have your favourite skin, how much do you care about unlocking other skins?) - and those who didn't want to spend hours unlocking stuff could spend a little cash to get it - if they wanted to.The new system puts almost everything behind a paywall. The minute number of cosmetics on the ""free"" track are often insultingly lazy, simple recolours or minor alterations, while they put serious effort into skins that you can only buy for $20. The content you can unlock by grinding often feels like it only exists to drag you into interfaces that advertise the paid content for you. Even content from the first game, that was originally free, is now paid only.Battlepass systems suck. ""Pay us for the opportunity to unlock stuff if you play a lot. If you don't you have to pay us more, or lose the stuff you already paid for."" - Limited time deals, rotating shop offers, FOMO FOMO FOMO... it reeks of manipulation and insincerity.4. Occasional DLC packs of PvE adventures.These are Blizzard's ""new"" approach to PvE. Occasional mission packs where you can get a little bit of story and a PvE mission. You can pay (in my UK currency) £13 for the DLC pack, or £35 (the cost of a good indie game"" for the ""ultimate bundle"".So here's the thing - this content is the same amount of content, and the same pace of release as the old mission scenarios - it's just now, instead of them being a free event to get people excited about playing and encourage their friends to join up - now they're paid DLC.Nobody likes paying a regular subscription for a product that they previously owned completely. It doesn't make anyone like Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Office, and it doesn't make anyone like Blizzard.-----So this is why people are ""review bombing"" your game. You took something we paid for, supported and enjoyed for years, lied to us about your plans, and turned it into trash. Now you're telling us to pay for features and content we previously enjoyed in the game we paid for. It's greedy, it's cynical, it's manipulative, and you've lost our trust.Also you should fire Bobby Kotick."
「OMX」Eragon,0,August 11,7,,0,Not Recommended,"I've loved playing Overwatch since the beginning. But when Overwatch 2 came out, things changed, and not in a good way. It feels like they don't care about how much time players spend. Doing daily and weekly missions takes up a lot of time, but the rewards aren't worth it. It's disappointing because it seems like the developers care more about money than what players want. This shift has made the game less enjoyable and more like work, and it's not the same as it used to be. the developer just want your money and has no respect of what the players want anymore. Everything you will want in the game you wall have to pay for every week and every month and every season."
匚ソケム 乃レソムナ,0,August 11,19,,0,Not Recommended,"Overwatch players had been waiting for 2 years with barely any updates to OW1. Here's what they've got in OW2:- Loot boxes, which used to provide rewarding & nearly infinite progression to all OW1 players, were replaced with battle passes. Now if you want to be rewarded, you have to pay money every 2 months & turn your game into a part-time job, because the pass will expire at the end of a season.- New Heroes are now locked behind battle passes. A major aspect of Overwatch's core gameplay is switching heroes & adapting to the situation. This change goes against that core gameplay, put new players & those who don't want to pay money in a major disadvantage.- PVE, the major selling point of Overwatch 2, was cancelled. Blizzard is now asking you $15 for a handful of missions, with no features teased during OW2's development such as skill trees.Can't believe I'm gonna write this, but I miss Jeff Kaplan, I miss loot boxes. I'd rather learn C++ & Data structures instead of playing this ""sequel"".We live in a timeline where our favorite game franchises are being ruined by greed. We're in the wrong timeline, lads."

The gamemode ""no limits"", as well as various custom gamemodes made by the community is about the only real fun one can have with this game. With friends.The greedy corporate practices made by this company are horrible, selling skins for upwards of $20 per hero(in a game with like 30+ heros?) as well as putting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ co-op missions behind a paywall. Furthermore, a lot of cosmetic packs contains ♥♥♥♥ nobody asked for or wants(what's the point of souvenirs??) just to artificially inflate the already predatory prices further. I believe there used to be a pack for $42 that included 2 skins and some other gaudy garbage.1/10."

Da Bird,1,August 11,7,,0,Not Recommended,"To the overwatch fans: This is is not a review bombing from TF2 fans. Overwatch was a game with promise, a bit lacking in features and game modes but people really loved it. All it needed was support. Instead all it got was lootboxes, a few additional heroes, and a few additional maps. Then we were promised all the content that should've been added to Overwatch in a sequel called Overwatch 2. What was actually added? Additional monetization in an effort to nickle and dime every cent they can from people. Nothing new has been added to this game. A few more maps, a few more heroes, and a few copy pasted pve events that they've been rolling out temporarily every few years.There's no love behind this game, no passion, no art, nothing. It's a soulless husk being squeezed for every penny that it can and it's completely worthless. Twenty years later people still remember games like Unreal Tournament. In twenty years nothing will be remembered of Overwatch but porn."

																Constant questionable balancing decisions that really make me question why I keep playing, on top of the anti consumer micro transaction practises + Bobby Kotick + inability to make a balanced hero in the past 3 years. They want to make new players pay for hero's unlocked from the start in order to ""aid the new player experience"". Overwatch 2 is like when that awesome friend you grew up with randomly becomes an alcoholic and beats his partner. Honestly this is one of the best games in mechanics and is totally ruined by the management who make the developers who put their sole into the game look like they are greedy soul-consuming anti-human wankers. Somehow Bobby Kotick makes Mark Zuckerberg look human. But like an abusive relationship I will return. It genuinely feels like I am rubbing my balls with sandpaper.If you are looking at this game as a new player.......Don't"

Krezg,0,August 11,24,,3,Not Recommended,"Let me tell you about this truly awful game company, one that seems to have no regard for its players except for how much money it can squeeze out of them. They have recently released Overwatch 2 as a free to play business model, but don't be fooled, my friend. This new model is filled to the brim with microtransactions, overpriced skins, and downright predatory behavior.But wait, it gets even worse. They have actually shut down the first game, rendering it completely unplayable for all those who had purchased it. Can you believe that? They simply expect the entire playerbase to migrate over to this free to play model if they want to continue enjoying the game. It's a blatant disregard for their loyal customers and a clear money grab.Now, you might be thinking, ""Well, at least they promised a PvE Hero mode with character progression, right?"" Wrong! Just when you thought there might be a glimmer of hope, they go ahead and cancel that too. Can you believe the audacity? It's as if they're actively trying to disappoint and deceive their players.But fear not, dear gamer. They do offer a lighter story mission for the low, low price of $15. How generous of them, right ? But it's a shame that they wouldn't just give the players what they wanted in the first place. In any case, we can only hope that the gaming industry will learn from this experience and be more transparent with their players in the future. Companies should be more willing to provide content that their customers are willing to pay for, without resorting to tactics like these. Additionally, they should be more open and honest about their pricing structure, so players don't feel like they're being taken advantage of. Just think of how much more money the gaming industry would make if they simply asked players for their opinion on what content they'd like to pay for, instead of resorting to these underhanded tactics!"

Such an amazing Blizzard moment.My favorite part was when Sojourn said ""This ends now!"" And ended PvE development indefinitely. One of the Overwatch moments of all time.I love the part where Junkrat said, ""Fire in the hole!"" and proceeded to blow up the development of PvE to smithereens.Loved when Moira said ""Surrender to my Greed"" as she takes the creed and motto of Blizzard to heart and decimates the PVE from existence.I loved the part when Tracer said ""time's up"" just like our patience for PVE.I loved the part when Zenyatta said “experience disappointment” and proceeded to cancel PVE.I love when Ashe said, “Bob, do something!” And then Bob shot down our hopes of getting PVE.I loved when reaper said ""clearing the area"" and destroyed all the people and machines working on PVE.I loved the part where Bap said 'I'm only guilty of stealing PVE' then jumped off sanctum.I loved when Zarya said “fire at will” and the executives at blizzard fired all the PVE developers.I loved the part where mei said "" it's blizzard time"" and she proceeded to freeze the pve developers.When Ashe said she was “heartless” it totally reminds me of blizzard when they stole PvE from us.I loved when Reinhardt said, ""HAMMER DOWN!"" and stunned the whole PvE team so they couldn't work on it.My absolute favorite part is when Widowmaker said “No can hide from my sight” and then proceeded to see no one working on the PvE campaign.Love it when Orisa said ""I have a bad feeling about this"" and then Blizzard cancelled PVE. Amazing !I liked the part where Pharah said “injustice rains from above” and let Blizzard cancel PVE.I loved it when mercy said, “sometimes I’m not sure why I even bother” and didn’t even bother with the PVE.I loved the part when Sombra popped her ult and said ""Apagando las PvE!"" and scrapped what we've been begging for since 2019. Truly a blizzard moment.I love that Reinhardt said “ Are you afraid to fight me” and fought everyone working on pve.I love hearing it whenever Lucio says, ""OH LET'S BREAK OUR PLAYERBASE'S TRUST!"" Lucio dropped the beat, so hard blizzard had to cancel PVE.I love when genji said “I need pve” and didn’t get it.I loved when Reaper said ""BUY! BUY! BUY!"" and the item shop appeared and proceeded to tell me every 5 minutes that a 6 year old skin is now in the item shop for 20§ and then PVE got canceled!Loved that time when Orisa said ""Meet your fate!"" and then PVE met its fate and got smashed into tiny little pieces. Truly one of the moments of all time. I love the part where Reaper says ""Die, Die, Die!"" then proceeds to kill off the PvE.I LOVED the part where Reinhardt shatters our faith and respect for Blizzard as a company.I loved the part where Lucio said ""Oh let's break it DOWN"" and broke down the entire community's hopes for a good PvE mode.I love when Hanzo said “Let the dragon consume PvE” and dropped Overwatch players pointless sequel of the original game with battle pass and the shop no one asked for. Truly an Overwatch 2 moment.I loved when roadhog went “unloading scrap” and scrapped the entire pve.I loved when Mercy says “Blizzard always LIES!” And cancelled what a majority of the community was looking forward to.I loved it when DVA said ""Activate Self-Destruct Sequence"" and blizzard blew up our hopes for pve.I love the part when Junker Queen says, ""My PvE is where I say it is!"" and points to a dumpster fire.My favourite part was when Ashe shouted ""Bob, do nothing!"", and Bob decided to stop working on the PVE.I loved it when Torbjörn yelled ""molten core!!"" and then the cpu cores in the single computer making PvE turned into lava.I loved the part where Sojourn said ""Development ends now!"" and she proceeded to fire a railgun shot at the last computer working on PVE.I absolutely adore when mercy says ""I'll send you my consultation fee!"" And proceeds to fee us for the pve, the new characters, and for the new skins.I loved it when witch mercy said ""My servants pay in credit"" and proceeded to empty everyone's bank account.I love it when zen said “Pass into the unknown” and the PVE team did.Are you wondering why Zenyatta got a Pinocchio skin? That's because Zenyatta lied about the PvE update.I loved when Sigma said “the wallets sing for me” as he used his gravity powers to suck the money from our wallets.I love it when mei said ""Freeze dont move"" and froze the pve team.I liked the part when Ramattra said ""Justice is cruel, it demands a sacrifice"" and then he proceeded to sacrifice the pve devs in a ritual.I liked the part where Doomfist said to  Blizzard ""such potential... wasted"" as Blizzard made OW2 a game missing 80% of its promised features hidden behind 20$ skins.I love when Lucio shouted ""Turning up the heat!"" and then raised the pressure price to $15 for 3 missions.My favourite part was when Winston said ""A better world is impossible today!"", as he fails to deliver the PVE to the community.I loved the part when Sombra said “apagando las luces” and completely shut down the skill tree.I love when pharah said ""SKILL TREES RAIN FROM ABOVE"" and threw all the skill trees outside of Blizzard HQ to be broken and never recovered.I loved when reinhardt shouted ""FOR THE BATTLEPASS!"" Then proceeded to shatter the pve and skill trees, truly one of the moments of all time.My favorite part is when Zenyatta said “Pass into nothingness” and PVE did exactly that.Loved the part where Genji says “THE DISAPPOINTMENT BECOMES ME!” As he unleashed his dragon blade and slashed away all of the unfinished skill trees and hero missions so that way blizzard could have their well deserved rest for working so hard.Loved the part where Zen says ""Experience no accountability!"" and then proceeds to scrap pve and sell old skins for 20$.I love when orisa says ""BUY A MORE-EH"" And proceeds to destroy my bank account and cancels PVE.I loved the part when Sigma said “the money sings to me” and used his ult to send the game improvements to the stratosphere.My favorite part is when Soldier said ""I've got you in my sights"" little did we know he was talking about everyones wallet he had in his sight.Really loved the part where Mercy said ""Profits never die!"" as she flies around lifting money from our pockets.When Torb said ""MOLTEN LORE"" and burned down all the PvE files; it was truly one of the moments of all time.I loved the part where soldier says “remember what we’re fighting for” then abandons PVE.Loved the part where widow said ""no one can hide from my sight"" referring to everyone's wallets that she can see. Truly a blizzard moment.Loved when pharah said ""disappointment rains from above"" and proceeded to cancel everything related to PvE.I loved it when Bastion hummed a little tune, and then dropped a mortar on the single computer from 1998 that was working on PVE. Inspirational.My favorite part was when Wrecking Ball said ""dropping"" and accurately predicted the player count."
Hajime Kashimo,0,August 13,16,,48,Not Recommended,"To every content creator reading this that ""Can't believe people are review bombing the game on steam. Think of the devs."" and the worst statement ""This season has the most content so far and people are still complaining"" WAKE UP or stop lying to your self. OW 1 was ABANDONED for 4 years with 0 content and then blizzard promised a full story mode and talent trees and blah blah blah and then cancelled all of that after changing the game from being 5$ on sale with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to being free upfront with 19$ skins plus a battle pass. THEN after all that monetization they bring back like 8% of the story mode that was promised and still charge 15 dollars for that AND you cant use coins that you've earned in game to buy the story missions so anyone who has saved up coins from their weekly's, and definitely has enough coins by now to buy this story mission pack if it was 1500 coins instead of 15$, can't buy it without using real money. This season may have ""the most content so far"" but that isn't saying much seeing as the only thing its adding that the other seasons didn't is the story missions which aren't included in the battle pass. THE STORY MISSIONS ARE SEPARATE FROM THE SEASON. THEY ARE BOUGHT SEPARATELY. This is the same exact thing Destiny 2 does (another game that activision forced to make a sequel when there was no need). In Destiny 2 you have a seasonal battle pass thats 10$ but its separate from the expansions they release every year so you have to pay twice for 1 season of content that should be bundled.Like most other people writing reviews I have tons of hours (1500~on xbox and 1300~on pc) and you are delusional if you think I'm going to write this review like I just started playing the game yesterday and haven't been playing since consol beta and seen all of the good and bad of this game. Also everyone knows it's not the devs fault for most of this stuff (other than hero balance and map/gamemode design) and that all the marketing and business practices are because of the higher ups but thats the people who these reviews are aimed at. Like with all big games and movies and shows the executives who these reviews are aimed at will ignore the reviews and, as they already are, will simply say the game was review bombed and they'll most likely remove all the reviews before a week has passed but all of these reviews are real from real people who care about the game and haven't had a place to band togeather and express their displeasure at how they've been treated until now. And to all the content creators that are saying ""all these negative reviews are from people who play all day everday"" OF COURSE THEY ARE. THOSES ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WANT THE GAME TO BE GOOD AND WHEN ITS NOT GOOD THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE THINGS IS TO SPEAK UP. Why would a new person give a negative review after a couple hours, like, do you understand what you are saying. And I'm not even going to get into how every content creator constatly flip flops between posting screen shots of twitch at 4am with more people watching roblox than overwatch and saying the game is dead to posting right when a season comes out about how much content there is and how anyone who says bad stuff about the game is a hater. 8/10 content creators are fake and change their opinion to fit the popular narrative and even attack other content creators for their opinions. Vultures. Vile people and vultures.Anyway. At its core Overwatch is an amazing game and nothing will ever come close but the company running it is the most vile gaming company in existence and their business practices even out do EA (Not forgiving them for Battlefront 2 which they fixed and then cut the servers. Also cut support for anthem.) The only hope for things to get better is the Microsoft acquisition finalizing and Bobby Kotick being pushed out. A lot of people don't like Microsoft for one reason or another but they are FAR more consumer friendly than Activation Blizzard. A final note to any content creator reading this. Grow up. Look in the mirror and realize that you can make decisions for your self and you will still have an audience. From everything the public has ever heard Blizzard aren't nice to you guys either so there's no reason to like their boots and speak out against these reviews like you work for them.Edit: I stand by all that stuff but also HOLY MOLY the game crashes mid game like every hour or two."
ooMIGIToo,0,August 15,11,,0,Not Recommended,"1544 hour diamond Zen veteran since day 0. This game use to be a right gem despite all the crummy balancing, toxicity, and lack of heroes. The original team really tried to keep the fans happy and excited, but the slow drip method was just not working. All the feedback provided fell on deaf ears and the game fell to the wayside. This game had a special place in my heart, but after playing season 1 OW2 something didn't feel right. The game just lost its charm and was simply no fun anymore. Why was I playing this? Why were any of us playing this? Was a hope that the game would return to its former glory and become fun to muck around in again? There was always the toxic player base that made competitive pointless in gold and plat, and made those playing in QP feel worthless, driving away newcomers or those just trying to relax after a day of work.OW1 had everything we wanted and more, but OW2 took away the systems and game we loved and turned into a F2P, microtransaction, FOMO, hellscape that we were promised wouldn't happen. Activision really dropped the ball on game that had huge potential.Take it from a vet. Don't waste your time. I wasted too much of mine."

Game is fun don't get me wrong, but it is not the Overwatch I and milions of other people fell in love with. TL;DR Not worth wasting your time, money, emotions and effort on this. Game fell off and is gonna die because of the devs and playerbase of nerds, porn addicts and f2p kids that buy battlepasses and overpirced content for the price of another Triple A Game.Just play Team Fortress 2, Paladins, Rainbow Six Siege or even f**king Valorant if you wan't a class/hero based shooter that is actually decent and does not want your wallet every 2 months.

I could write a long list of issues I have with the game, but ultimately I don't enjoy any of it.  Nothing about this game is fun anymore.  The matches are stale and one sided.  I've been in matches where you are waiting for it to end so you can try and play a better balanced match.  There are unity mobile ads that are more enjoyable than this.So I will just say, if you like this type of game, there are better ones out there.  I simply don't enjoy this anymore.  Its permanently off too."
小黄的老程,0,August 15,20,,191,Not Recommended,"There is no doubt that Overwatch was once unmatched, but in recent years, the heroes’ balance of the game is seriously freaking out , and there are serious loopholes in the internal management of Blizzard, which makes this game go into decline.

It does not take into account the efforts of players for many years, it is really a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid company!! In the past, it take players’ interests as treasures and finally it treats us like ♥♥♥♥.

LK335q,0,August 21,9,,0,Not Recommended,"TLDR: I just want Overwatch 1 back. :( Now I'm going to write a heavily opinionated rambling essay on my grievances with Overwatch while running on fumes late the night before my college semester begins, because for the latter half of my high school years this game was one of the few things I had to look forward to every day. Seeing it in the state it's in now makes me feel as though it's taken a part of me away with it.At the time of writing, the number of hours I've played as listed in-game is 735. For the first years of Overwatch's release, I lived, breathed, and drowned in this game. I don't regret a single second of that. Some of my best teenage memories were spent with Overwatch at the core of it all. I met new friends and grew closer to old friends through it. Overwatch is one of only about four games that have brought me such joy in my life. I loved this game and everything about it.Around Christmas of 2016, I picked it up with a close childhood friend of mine and we played for hours and hours on end, each and every day. I instantly fell in love with Overwatch. The gameplay was fresh and addicting. The characters and the story interested me enough that I would scour YouTube for lore tidbits and every bit of news on the game I could find when I was supposed to be doing schoolwork. I looked forward to hearing papa Jeff tell us all about the awesome new updates that the game received. Between gaming sessions I would listen to coaches like Jayne so that I could learn how to play Overwatch.I wanted to be good at this game.I took pride in maining Sombra. I tried learning as many tips and tricks for her as I could. 16 year old me felt cathartic when someone praised me for my Sombra. For the first time in my life I found something that demanded effort from me while also feeling rewarding.This was Overwatch between the years of 2016 and 2019.Something changed about the game within that time. I can't put an exact date on it, but I'm sure anyone else who shares my experience knows what I mean. The players became more jaded. The sense of fun withered away, some kind of bitter resentment slowly festering in its place. Developers who touted transparency communicated with the players less and less. The grand epic story failed to move forward after years of buildup. The competitive scene slowly overtook every aspect of the game as the Overwatch League became more prevalent, hero balance and map design focusing on esports first and players second. People became alienated from heroes they enjoyed playing because of drastic balance changes, reworks, and meta shifts.Blizzard gearing the game towards competitive pushed away Overwatch's casual players.At the time, it seemed that the game was slowly fizzling away. I found myself losing interest along with many others simply because the game just didn't feel fun anymore. Overwatch became a game you play to win, not a game you play for entertainment. Others may have different reasons to have lost interest in the game, but that was mine. I remember how I felt when Overwatch 2 was leaked. I was a little bit excited. More than anything else, I felt dread. I was afraid of what a sequel would mean for the game that I had adored. In hindsight I find that reaction strange, because on paper it seems like I should have been ecstatic. Overwatch finally had a chance to be saved, if the leaks were true. And come to find out, they were. Overwatch 2's announcement seemed promising. It's the same game but now with a PvE campaign to go alongside it. The perfect chance for Overwatch to redeem itself with its casual playerbase, assuming that nothing goes wrong.The game was revealed, and that was it. For the longest time, nothing. Eventually, Overwatch 2 did release. Seeing that we're all here, I'm sure I don't need to explain the rest.I am beyond disappointed with the direction of this game in the short time since Overwatch 2 released. Somehow, not only were none of the issues I had with the game in the past solved, but they were actually made worse. And to add insult to injury, the one thing that was the entire point of Overwatch 2 in the first place was cancelled. PvE, as it was promised, is not coming. All we get is a cheap, half-baked approximation with a 15 USD price tag slapped onto it as an added ♥♥♥♥-you. In fact, allow me to list every particular grievance I have with this game that I can be bothered to consider at this moment minus the cut PvE content, because I feel the need to put into perspective how this sequel has managed to not only backtrack compared to the original game, but fall into a pit of mud behind it and soil its pants while spontaneously bursting into flames. Overwatch 2 has:- Put a price tag on all original Overwatch 1 cosmetics, which were once available completely free of charge. With the absurd overpricing of cosmetics in this game, Overwatch 1's once-free collection of cosmetics will now run you approximately ~$12,000 if you want to purchase all of it at once.- Broken the promise made in the days of Overwatch 1 that new and old heroes would all be free and fully available to play for everyone, requiring no unlocks.- Removed features compared to the original, including: an entire core game mode from the map rotation, the on-fire feature (though at the time of writing this was re-implemented), profile borders, the card screen at the end of matches, exact SR, and I'm sure there's more that I'm forgetting. - Went out of its way to reduce CC and oppressive abilities from the game, then for reasons beyond me, two of the first new heroes released - Ramattra and Kiriko - have some of the most oppressive abilities in the game.- Fully transitioned from 6v6 to 5v5, which in my opinion is an absolute nightmare. Healing and pocketing is even stronger than it was in OW1, meaning now it's nearly a requirement to kill the healers before anyone else. Tanks are a headache to play in this system - with only one tank per team, hero advantages play such a massive role that you're put at a very heavy disadvantage if you don't mirror or counter the enemy tank.It's just exhausting. I really could keep going, but this review is long enough as is.Overwatch 2 feels like it's too little too late. Too many broken promises, too many compromises, too much greed, and to top it all off the game hardly retains even a sliver of its original spirit. I just can't help but feel like the people at Blizzard forgot what Overwatch was.Overwatch is a hero shooter. It's about HEROES. It was plastered literally everywhere. You log into the game and are greeted with a heroic score and one of many heroes in their iconic pose like they're a Marvel character. The game was full of so much hope and optimism in its tone. In Overwatch 2? The title screen is there to show off the new battle pass theme. The heroes aren't heroes anymore. I mean, Orisa, the protector of Numbani, lost her shield and was given a javelin in place of it. The tone of Overwatch has shifted, and I believe that's because its original spirit was lost.I still think that the characters and the story are kinda cool though. Ramattra is pretty awesome, I like him. The art direction behind the game is as impressive as ever. I'm sure the story isn't that bad either. Some part of me still loves this game. I've had too many memories with it to forget any time soon, but everything that I once played this game for is now gone. Blizzard has announced that another rework of Sombra is coming, and I think that once she's no longer the same, that will be the end of the Overwatch I once loved. After so many years of playing this game, at the time of writing this review, I have uninstalled it from my machine. I don't intend to return soon.I just really miss the time when this game was fun. Thank you Blizzard for creating one of the best games I have ever played, and I hope you are proud of yourselves for what you've done to it."

It's crisp fun gameplay with lots of awesome characters. Colourful and really diverse. I could praise this game till death.However the current state of this game and Blizzard is just awful. Don't get me wrong, this game is still a ton of fun. But it could be so much more than that. The community took one hit after another just because Blizzard was greedy for money. The devs don't really care about this game anymore, the monetization is horendous with even the scrapped pve recycled missions costing 15 euros. This game feels like pure greed right now, bringing back old features they scrapped in a worse way. The league is dying. And and and.... I just wish they would've never announced Overwatch 2 :("

Shin,5,August 11,27,4,2,Not Recommended,"Aight, Another negative review.I'm a 6 year veteran player in this game. Used to literally study the game to teach people to play it. And I refuse to call it a sequel.Project Titan gave birth to 2 games. Overwatch and Firefall. Both died with bad management. Firefall was a MMOFPS from the start, Overwatch was suposed to be a ""beta"" for another MMOFPS. Or as they call it, the ""walk"". But Bobby Kotick Happened somewhere. Mr. Call of Money, CEO of Activision since 1991. And Activision Blizzard since 2008.To be honest, ever since Activision and Blizzard became one, they have released 7 games:StarCraft 2 (2010), Diablo 3 (2012), Hearthstone (2014), Heroes of the Storm (2015), Overwatch (2016), Diablo Immortal (2022) and Diablo 4 (2023)Hope you can see where Kotick started to put his hands on our games.StarCraft 2 had no problems on launch because it was too late in development. But remember Diablo 3 Launch RMTs and bad Servers? Hearthstone is a game that ONLY works with microtransactions, Heroes of the Storm were built after the success of League of Legends, Overwatch, the last original blizzard game, launched with a box price and microtransaction lootboxes. (that looking back now, were not so bad), Diablo Immoral...Look for Josh Strife Heyes video. And Diablo 4 That right now, is being drowned in bad reviews.No game after kotick has been ""Blizard Level""Now, after the history recap. To Overwatch Review.Good points?The comunity is passionate.Created a lot of oportunities for smaller streamers to grow.Had the passion of the old team emanating from every single character, map, voice line even the gut down version of the CAMPAIGN.Now for the current bad. And oh boy. There are a lot to be done.First of all. Bobby Kotick still have this game as hostage.The game won't respect your investments. Be it time or money.Balance is only done to ""mix the meta up"" because designwise, asymetrical characters will never be balanced.Most of the Development team LEFT or were cut from Blizzard. so the ""NEW TEAM"" are literally learning how to make Overwatch again.The ""events"" in the game are shadows of the first year of life of the game. About the unpredictable future of Overwatch.This update had everything they had in their pockets after a few seasons without releasing content. The cut down Campaign, the latest new character, new game mode and maps. From now on, Overwatch's Future is a mystery. People who bought and played the campaign, liked the story, but wants more and do not know if we will ever get it. Those who still play the main game, have no fun anymore or are only playing because their friends still playing. BUT with Microsoft now holding the company, who knows. There's hope, but not much.I don't want this game to die, because I've met friends, my wife and they still have fun sometimes with it, The game still have all the potential it had from when it launched... but the way this is heading, hope is running thin.""Never accept the world as it appears to be. Always dare to see it for what it could be."" - Jeffrey Kaplan"
Karicas,0,August 11,6,,28,Not Recommended,"It is insane how Blizzard lunches good games but then proceeds to ruin every single one over time. What a money hungry company! Advertises Overwatch 2 will have PVE mode, canceles it and expects us then to pay extra 15-40$ for it!"
JumboSizedFish,0,August 13,4,,0,Not Recommended,"Overwatch 2 is a 2022 sequel to the titular 2014 Overwatch, and mate, I have to be honest with you: I made this review for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles to contribute to the blizzard of negative reviews, so I have a hilarious amount of playtime. However, I also made this to make sure you know that this game wasn’t worth my time, and more importantly, neither yours. While I never played the original Overwatch, I heard by its fans that it was a fun and enjoyable game… but then, Blizzard Entertainment, being the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ they forever are, ruined everything!For those unaware, Overwatch got a – quote-unquote “sequel” – with hopes of including an admittedly promising cooperative players vs. enemies campaign, jam-packed with skill trees, randomization, and other good ideas that extends replayability and fleshes out this new mode. But of course, we can’t have nice things, sadly; after hyping up the game with many fans wanting to play together in this PvE gamemode, Blizzard decided to can the mode and many of this features, then double downs with a classic pull of “Blizzcon 2023.”This self-proclaimed sequel will never be worth it, as the main reason why it even exists was pulled away, and considering Blizzard and generally every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AAA games company, I doubt that Blizzard wouldn’t even brother making a reasonable substitute. If you are a fan of Overwatch, nothing wrong with that by the way, then I recommend finding something else to play, as Blizzard isn’t worth your time nor money; perhaps consider patching Overwatch to support private servers, since Blizzard since then couldn’t do that.At the end of the day, is Overwatch coming back? Oh, hell no!!P.S. I was actually planning while writing the review to give the game an actual shot, but creating a Battle.net account was and still is a massive plan in the ass. When I finally made it to the human verification, wasting minutes solving twenty math puzzles, the website refreshed and the account was never made. Despite that, that will ever be more fun than this bloody game, and even then, I was getting really pissy on how annoying such puzzles are."

Marble,0,August 12,25,,43,Not Recommended,"Overwatch had everything to be a good game, but the greed of the developers ruined it. In 2017 it was an exciting team game, I remember a lot of people laughing and saying that this is a team fortress 2 killer. And now here we are, the team fortress 2 and overwatch community have come together to humiliate overwatch and I fully support them! The greedy company is to blame for everything, which is squeezing the last juices out of its cash cow. I don’t even see the point in listing all their broken promises and sins, you all know them very well. They killed overwatch with a ""2"". I had hope for the best, but apparently you can no longer hope, all adequate people have long since left Blizzard and they are left with only LGBT workers who are only interested in holding a month of pride and a wallet full of money. I think it's not worth talking about the fact that they have production hell there. This is a vivid example of the fact that the greed of developers can ruin any game at any time."

There was one lord that showed the world he can make great games and treat people fair and with equalness. His name was Blizzard. The world trusted his magicians who created diffrent fantasy worlds full of fun and love. It did not take long, Activision could not satisfy the greed of his secret monster named ""Bobby"" that was trapped in the upper dungeon of his headquaters swimming in pools of champagne and breastmilk. The people loved and valued Blizzard for the joy he brought to their lifes. It did not take long the monster got too strong. To survive it needed to incorporate more gamer souls and make them suffer as many before them suffered. Blizzard fought strong and defended his lands with honor and glory, but everything was futile. Over the years the moster got too mighty. Blizzard lost the fight and had to give in. But as many legends said: Not all heroes were capes. A close friend of Blizzard who gave his everything to help defend Blizzards lands like it was his own son. Today people still tell stories about that hero named ""Jeff"". But to protect his family he decided to go a diffrent route. He fought willingly but could not save his friend. That decision might have saved his life legends say. Looking back on the shards of his friend all that was left was his broken heart. That was the last time we heard from him. He might have found a new friend. Meanwhile the monster was still alive. The people got left in the dust with bread crumps for years with no hope in sight.Months went by and the people lost hope more and more. Weekly false promises and worse desicions of balancing their new lands lead to people looking for new jobs. A new experience was praised from the lords but it was all the curtain of the dark money spell. Food was rare, it was a true dark time for many people. But there was this small hope on the horizon. A new maschine and new ways of earning food. A new maschine was delivered but it did not work how it should. The people slowly realized if they just stop buying the overpromised lands maybe the kingdom Activision would fall apart and could get back to his older days. But the monster controlled the lands with his iron claws.5 years later it was a cold season, Activision was desperate. People noticed the might of Activision does not look that bad if you just leave the lands and look for alternatives. Demoralized Activision reached out to some far away monks named ""Microsoft"" and ""Valve"" to save his lands from the total downfall. But it was too late. Was the monster defeated? Bad stories were told about Activision in the suggestions box of Valves castle door. Till this day only selected legends will understand the full story.What have we learnd today kids? Yes absolutely correct: Karma will get everbody even monsters and their false kings.Sincerly your brother - Cas -"

EarlyZ,0,August 11,7,8,2,Not Recommended,"Ah, Overwatch 2, the game that's been ""coming soon"" for so long, I started to think it was sponsored by that one friend who's always late to the party. But hey, good things come to those who wait, right? Well, after waiting for centuries, I finally got my hands on Overwatch 2, and let me tell you, it's like they put the ""hi"" back in ""wait.""First of all, let's talk about the new heroes. They've got Sojourner, who looks like she's been hitting the gym and the library simultaneously. She's got the kind of biceps that could give Reinhardt a run for his armor. But you know, for someone who's all about knowledge and enlightenment, she sure spends a lot of time hanging out in the battlefield shooting stuff. Maybe her ""intellectual conversations only"" Zoom call got canceled.And then there's good ol' Junkrat, the explosive jester himself. He's still as lovable as ever, with his wild cackles and knack for turning every fight into a pyrotechnic extravaganza. I swear, if Overwatch was a sitcom, Junkrat would be the wacky neighbor who accidentally blows up his own mailbox every week. But hey, at least he's consistent!Now, let's talk about the maps. Blizzard seems to have taken the ""world tour"" approach, as we're traveling to all these cool locations like Rome, Rio, and New York. It's like they decided, ""Hey, saving the world is great, but have you tried doing it while enjoying some gelato?"" I can just imagine the Overwatch team's brainstorming session: ""Okay, we've got Paris. Now let's add the Eiffel Tower as a payload. Genius!""And can we talk about the game's title, ""Overwatch 2""? It's like they went, ""Hey, sequels need numbers, but let's not get too crazy. Just slap a '2' on there and call it a day."" It's like naming the second kid in a family ""Junior"" because you couldn't be bothered to come up with a new name. Classic move.But jokes aside, Overwatch 2 does promise some pretty exciting updates. The story mode looks like a blast, and the new PvP changes have everyone buzzing like a certain electric scientist. So, after all is said and done, I have to admit, Overwatch 2 might have taken its sweet time, but just like a fine wine or a perfectly timed ""Nerf this!"" explosion, it's worth the wait.Rating: 5/5 exploding piñatas – Unexpectedly explosive, and full of colorful surprises!

NeKrowmancer,0,August 13,32,3,0,Not Recommended,"Disappointment is the feeling of dissatisfaction that follows the failure of expectations or hopes[1] to manifest. Similar to regret, it differs in that a person who feels regret focuses primarily on the personal choices that contributed to a poor outcome, while a person feeling disappointment focuses on the outcome itself.[2] It is a source of psychological stress.[3] The study of disappointment—its causes, impact, and the degree to which individual decisions are motivated by a desire to avoid it—is a focus in the field of decision analysis,[2][4] as disappointment is, along with regret, one of two primary emotions involved in decision-making.[5]EtymologyDisappoint is traced to the Middle English disappointen by way of the Old French desapointer. In literal meaning, it is to remove from office.[6] Its use in the sense of general frustration traces to the late 15th century, and it first appears recorded in English as an emotional state of dejection in the middle 18th century.[7]PsychologyDisappointment is a subjective response related to anticipated rewards.[8] Disappointment recovery time depends on the intensity of the disappointment, as well as the person experiencing the disappointment. For some it can take a few minutes while for others the same disappointment can take a few days.Disappointment, and an inability to prepare for it, has also been hypothesized as the source of occasional immune system compromise in optimists.[9] While optimists by and large exhibit better health,[10] they may alternatively exhibit less immunity when under prolonged or uncontrollable stress, a phenomenon which researchers have attributed to the ""disappointment effect"".[9] The ""disappointment effect"" posits that optimists do not utilize ""emotional cushioning"" to prepare for disappointment and hence are less able to deal with it when they experience it.[10][11] This disappointment effect has been challenged since the mid-1990s by researcher Suzanne Segerstrom, who has published, alone and in accord, several articles evaluating its plausibility. Her findings suggest that, rather than being unable to deal with disappointment, optimists are more likely to actively tackle their problems and experience some immunity compromise as a result.[12]In 1994, psychotherapist Ian Craib published the book The Importance of Disappointment, in which he drew on the works of Melanie Klein and Sigmund Freud in advancing the theory that disappointment-avoidant culture—particularly therapy culture—provides false expectations of perfection in life and prevents people from achieving a healthy self-identity.[13] Craib offered as two examples litigious victims of medical mistakes, who once would have accepted accidents as a course of life, and grieving people following the death of a loved one who, he said, are provided a false stage model of recovery that is more designed to comfort bereavement therapists than the bereaved.[14]Lacanians considered childhood disappointment essential to entry into the symbolic world of culture;[15] disappointment in adulthood - the frustration of our demands by the world - as key to discovering who in fact we are.[16]LawWhere goods or services have been purchased in the hope of some enjoyment and the delivery of the goods or services fails to generate the anticipated result, customers have at times sought damages for breach of contract on the grounds of disappointment and distress. Such damages are not generally allowed by the courts, but there are cases where an award for damages has been considered and agreed. English law cases include Jarvis v Swans Tours Ltd (1972) and Farley v Skinner (2001).Milner v Carnival (2010) is another example where customers, in this case Mr and Mrs Milner, who took an extended cruise on the Cunard ship Queen Victoria, had expectations of a benefit which did not materialise and for which damages were sought both for ""diminution of value"" (the quantifiable difference between the payment made and the value derived) and for ""distress and disappointment"". Judge Simon Tuckey gave permission for an appeal against the trial ruling on damages, noting that this case ""may provide the opportunity to give authoritative guidance on the appropriate measure of damages in 'holiday' cases"" where disappointment is an issue.[17]TheoryDisappointment theory, pioneered in the mid-1980s by David E. Bell with further development by Graham Loomes and Robert Sugden,[18] revolves around the notion that people contemplating risks are disappointed when the outcome of the risk is not evaluated as positively as the expected outcome.[19] Disappointment theory has been utilized in examining such diverse decision-making processes as return migration, taxpayer compliance and customer willingness to pay.[20] David Gill and Victoria Prowse have provided experimental evidence that people are disappointment averse when they compete.[21]Disappointed individuals focus on ""upward counterfactuals""—alternative outcomes that would have been better than the one actually experienced—to the point that even positive outcomes may result in disappointment.[22] One example, supplied by Bell, concerns a lottery win of $10,000.00, an event which will theoretically be perceived more positively if that amount represents the highest possible win in the lottery than if it represents the lowest.[23] Decision analysts operate on the assumption that individuals will anticipate the potential for disappointment and make decisions that are less likely to lead to the experience of this feeling.[18] Disappointment aversion has been posited as one explanation for the Allais paradox, a problematic response in expected utility theory wherein people prove more likely to choose a certain reward than to risk a greater reward while at the same time being willing to attempt a greater reward with lower probability when both options include some risk.[24]While earlier developers of disappointment theory focused on anticipated outcomes, more recent examinations by Philippe Delquié and Alessandra Cillo of INSEAD have focused on the impact of later disappointment resulting when an actual outcome comes to be regarded negatively based on further development; for example, if a person receives higher than expected gains in the stock market, she may be elated until she discovers a week later that she could have gained much more profit if she had waited a few more days to sell.[18] This experience of disappointment may influence subsequent behavior, and, the analysts state, an incorporation of such variables into disappointment theory may enhance the study of behavioral finance.[18] Disappointment is, along with regret, measured by direct questioning of respondents.[25]See alsoAnticipationParis syndrome"

We want to reward good games that has the player's satisfaction in mind and not be complacent with bad practices.They even entice OW1 players that OW2 will have a separate PVE mode with its own skill trees.I am a OW2 player so I was not there in the glory days. However it went all downhill from there where the company decided to cancel its PVE separate mode, decided to drip feed PVE missions in chucks of 3 and ONLY ACCESSABLE THROUGH A 15USD purchase.Blizzard will always choose profits over player's fun.I would recommend this game but with a heavy terms and conditions applied - Don't play ranked in hopes that you get a fair game (play quickplay and just chill with friends)- Don't buy any battle passes if you think is not worth it. Blizzard and Bobby Kotick(The House) always win.I like this game however the direction of the game going is breaking my heart. I will play as long as it is still fun for me."

Dog Nerd,0,August 12,5,,3,Not Recommended,"You could have been a contender...It kind of sucks to have to leave a negative review for a game that I used to love so much, but as someone who has played Overwatch for hundreds of hours across the Xbox One and PC versions, Overwatch has only ever gotten worse thanks to the botched post-launch support. Every time that the Overwatch devs attempted to add new content, it managed to disrupt the enjoyment of the game's sandbox in ways that every kind of player could feel. It made keeping up with Overwatch extremely demoralizing all the way up until the game's final years where content drops slowed to a crawl. Everyone hoped that the followup to Overwatch would fix the game's multitude of unaddressed issues. But, we didn't account for Blizzard's incompetence.Blizzard's consistent trend of decline unfortunately made itself manifest in Overwatch 2, the game that was supposed to breathe life into this floundering franchise. For something that bills itself as a sequel, it is quite literally a downgrade in every conceivable way from Overwatch's initial launch version.They replaced a 40 dollar purchase that guaranteed all of the future content in the game to be unlocked and available with a horrific free 2 play model with all of the terrible features we've sadly become used to: an awful cash shop, new heroes locked behind either paywalls or extremely grindy challenges designed to make you want to skip them with a purchase, and previously advertised content being split up into tiny chunks and sold separately. Much of the promised PvE features including the super cool looking hero skill tree system were outright cancelled as well, cementing this game's marketing and its release as a huge fraud on the Overwatch community. People tend to not forget when you bait people in with exciting features that are coming in the future and then attempt to sweep it under the rug when you decide to scrap it.Buried underneath the messy development history and terrible, exploitative systems is a pretty fun casual shooter with charming characters, a great art style, and gameplay that can occasionally be very entertaining. However, why would anyone want to stick around to experience it when the company running that game has a proven track record of ruining every good thing they've ever made with horrible, heavy-handed balance updates, out of touch communication, and promises that things will improve that are always broken without fail? Most people won't want to, and that's why you shouldn't play this game."

⛧Marissa⛧,1,August 11,8,,93,Not Recommended,"I'm not going to get in all the diplomacy of why this game landed on Steam, nor all the shady stuff that Blizzard has done lately. I'm just going to talk about the game itself...It's an FPS that pretends to be played like a MOBA, and thus it's a playground for the most toxic, close-minded community that managed to surpass Dead By Daylight in the sense of hostiity between players, something I didn't think could be achieved.I'm far from the best player at anything, and I haven't played OW in general for 7 years now, but what I've noticed since I started playing is that EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. of the matches I've played end up with one team absolutely dominating the other. This could be a result of really bad matchmaking, and it happens both in casual or ranked matches.It seems that whatever happened in these years gave birth this forced playstyle of two bunch of people dancing back and forth in place, poking each other until someone gets bored, steps out, dies and then their whole team gets decimated as a result. I really don't mind team-play being the optimal way of playing, hell I would even consider it to be the most rewarding kind. But when it's the ONLY viable way of playing the game, it makes for a very broing, forced list of tasks to go through over and over and over, regardless of map, mode or team composition.Having owned the original game, I didn't have to go through the struggle of unlocking all characters, but I can only imagine what a horrible experience that would be. Either that or spend half the cost of a AAA-game on one character... Everything else, cosmetic-wise, is just as overpriced, and the PVE stuff that should've been the selling point for so many people is also, unsurprisingly overpriced for what it offers.The game also seems to be badly optimized, where I keep having frames drops and hiccups every few turns of my mouse, as if the game's struggling to load in all the models and textures while I move around, an issue I've never had with OW1.Overall this game left a very bad taste in my mouth, gave it a try for nostalgia sake and maybe messing around with friends for a few matches, but even as that I've never enjoyed a single minute of what I was offered."
Pyke Ozori,0,August 11,4,,0,Not Recommended,"I only installed and ""played"" this on Steam so I could leave a review. Started up the game and literally forgot it was running in the background which is the only reason I have more than 0.1 hours ""played"".Overwatch 1 was fun and all for a while even though they were constantly re-using their events. Blizzard had an excuse to no longer release proper updates with new heroes, maps, etc. because they claimed they were working hard on Overwatch 2 because it would be mainly focused on PvE which was their priority. Let's fast forward to right now, what did we get? They cancelled the promised PvE mode, yes, now there are PvE missions which will be released in batches of 3 that you will have to pay 15 dollars for every time and won't be anything close to the PvE content they promised. The game is no longer 6v6, they turned it into 5v5, might not sound like a big deal but it really made a difference in gameplay experience. No more lootboxes that you earn by levelling up for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, sprays, etc. instead there is a shop. The prices for the skins alone, including the ones from Overwatch 1 which people earned for free are 20 dollars, not to mention skins and what not that are locked behind bundles. They even got greedy with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Twitch drops which now give you 5 battle pass levels. Overwatch 2 heroes are locked behind the battle pass, you either gotta pay for it, or have to play this game enough to unlock the new hero for the on-going season which is a demonic sacrifice on its own.Are you new to Overwatch 2 and want to play as heroes from Overwatch 1 which everyone got absolutely free? Or maybe you missed out on some heroes from previous seasons? Don't worry, you can buy the Complete Hero Collection for 20 dollars.This game is literally just a worse version of Overwatch 1 with a 2 on the logo, more micro-transactions, a few new heroes and maps, and yes, still the exact same events from Overwatch 1. Junkenstein's Revenge is back of course, not even with a new map. It's exact same map but you get to play in a different area.Do yourself a big favor, save your money, don't give it to Blizzard and play an actual fun game instead of this boring, stale, piece of ♥♥♥♥ god forsaken disaster of a cash grab. Wake up, Blizzard. You guys should be absolutely ashamed of yourselves.If any other devs see this review, take a good look at Overwatch 2. There's no better game in existence to show you how to kill your game."

TheTopDogRob,1,August 11,6,,3,Not Recommended,"Look Overwatch definitely went down hill the past few years and while i don't hate it i feel ive been lied to about it especially the more recent content that has been added since the launch of Overwatch 2 if you can even call it Overwatch 2, it feels more like an extension if you ask me. Especially since the removed maps like horizon lunar colonies, and Temple of Anubis. As a player who has been playing it since April of 2017 ive seen this game grow and ive seen it fall and for questionable reasons too. The positive thing i can say about Overwatch being ported too steam is that my stuff got carried over my, 3000+ hours ive had on console, and ive gotten all my stuff. Gold weapons, skins, sprays, emotes. It even carried over all of my achievements so i don't have to try and 100% this game again. Thank god for that even if Junkenstein Revenge and Retribution were really fun. The question is do i recommend this game with friends, sure ive had fun moments in the past and still do time to time on this game. However i'm not gonna give this a positive review because of the state the game is in right now. If the game gradually gets better as time goes on i may consider coming back to my review and giving it a positive review. As of right now thumbs down Overwatch. What happened to you?"
SanitysEdge,0,August 11,4,,1,Not Recommended,"I never review anything but I figured I might as well give my two cents why this game and the company behind it are absolute trash and have betrayed me not only here but in another blizzard related game as well but first a disclaimer.I give not a single rats ass about the PVE It was never good and I dont even like Tf2s PVE either or the communities focused around it.- Firstly when the release of Overwatch originally happened it was a good time, fun times were had but I noticed sometime after the shift in the games atmosphere and focus shifted pretty heavily, it became more competitive focused starting with the removal of of multiheros from casual and ♥♥♥♥ only got worse from there, it got so bad that the community itself started morphing and catering to the type of clowns that still play league of Legend whos reputation is that of a whiny crying passive aggressive baby who cant hold L's to save their lives. I literally watched casual turn into Wienie Hut jr for competitive asshats instead of being a game where I can sit down and kill a couple peeps and relax unlike a certain game whos the precursor of Overwatch and its sequel and its still a good time. The last straw for me personally when it came to the community was when I watched our widowmaker get angry at a winston for spamming his voicelines and threaten to report him for it to which I and the team told him ""shut up you're an idiot"" at which then he piped down for the remainder of the game (we won) but not long after Blizzard instated a limit to speech spam I could see which way this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was blowing because I once saw LoL devolve to such ♥♥♥♥ and lo and behold it came to pass complete with role que. Enough though about how blizzard basically fostered a toxic community by design and choice, lets talk about why the game actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sucks.- Lack of depth or removal of depth to characters and mechanics some of the characters in this game feel like their missing things like some of the things you watch Overwatch characters do in cutscenes are actually full of ♥♥♥♥ or dont exist ingame, like to give an example The shimada brothers are capable of literally jumping up and down left right on walls in these cutscenes but they can only run up walls in game thats some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or how D.va actually have full hover and flight in the animation, Roadhog literally having another weapon on his back that he never uses and now recently Doomfist not being able to uppercut anymore even though all you would need to do is make it like Baptise where if you crouch and then hit space it gives you a higher jump but instead this high jump is also an attack Blizzard is Wholly afraid of being too creative with their character kits that its kinda annoying that they create these characters around Meta ♥♥♥♥ instead around being fun which now leads into the BIGGEST reason why this game sucks ass now- Game balance is absolutely trash and it got even worse when they removed a player slot now we got a few characters that are fundamentally not even working correctly because they were balanced around having another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tank but the reality is that Overwatch Balance fundamentally doesnt ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ work because its a System meant for MMORPGS and last time i checked overwatch is a PVP oriented game they really need to ditch it because all it does is limit them what they can do with the game and the characters in it.-Removal of features and or maps this is a pretty clear cut case lets be real here.-Monitization is absolutely abhorrent I played this game at its original release and looking at what they're doing to the F2P is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, League wasnt a good game when I got done with it but atleast they let their players earn their currency through games I cant believe Iam praising riot of all things for being more consumer friendly ffs.-Lack of content there is no reason why this new and shiny game should not have more content then it does now blizzards mismanagement and troubles have affected this game so much.- Blizzard themselves are the biggest fartsniffers on this earth I dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about no legality's or anything but damn if it doesnt make them look hypocritical when I see all these politcally charged ♥♥♥♥ in my videogames while mr kotick  basically steals the very souls of his employees(and maybe one or two babies) Ive seen their arrogance first hand when I was still playing world of warcraft and needless to say they ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pissed me off they do not listen to feed back or criticism or otherwise untill now that their backs are against the wall and even then people are still getting resistance.Pretty much basically save your time and effort because Blizzard is not worth supporting not until they finally get the message."

Realistically, the signs were there from the first balance patch in 2016.Now, the game only cares about siphoning as much money from your wallet as it can. PvE was cancelled (y'know, the whole reason for the sequel in the first place) and replaced with buyable missions, most of which seem to be around or below the quality of previously free 'story' events.The competitive integrity of the game is a joke. After years of fostering a culture of ""you can play whatever you want in comp, you don't even have to try to win"", Blizzard now wonders why nobody wants to play competitive. Not to mention of course the massive smurfing issues, which would only be exacerbated by F2P, if anyone still cared enough.Cheaters are rampant and regular, both the well-hidden and the obvious. Every balance change is completely nonsensical and thrown together with no critical thought. Their brand new ""hero progression"" is also a watered-down restoration of the previous system, which they chose to remove to put the focus on MTX.However, most importantly of all, Blizzard have just ruined the game. It's not fun, it's not challenging, it's just a yawn fest of visual noise and no rewards. I don't think I've ever quite seen a sequel be such a downgrade from a product that was already failing, and the only reason for the sequel is the cash shop. Don't waste your time, TF2 and even Paladins are much, much better."

brantodb01,0,August 14,4,,0,Not Recommended,"Overwatch was a great game, fun, interesting story hooks, pretty and was pretty good for the first year it was out.The biggest problem was getting your 5 teammates to coordinate in a push and not die in dribs and drabs.Then they started trying to balance the game around the E-sports scene they manufactured. This meant balancing the game around people who were good at overwatch, but most importantly, people who knew how to coordinate. So the issues became even more pronounced and unfun.Overwatch 2 is Overwatch 1 with micro transactions (The cosmetics aren't even good) and a team size of 5 instead of 6. This did improve the game slightly in that it was easier to coordinate however fixed roles and 1 tanks means that most of the ""tanks"" essentially have no role, as they overlap with DPS and support...but you only have 1 tank so not playing a tank is throwing.Plus the maps are the same, designed and balanced around having 6 players so the maps are too big with significant dead zones, map worse by how it's death ball vs death ball.Overwatch was a great start ruined by bad design over and over again for years until it's a shell of what it should've been"

Toast_i3,0,August 18,5,,2,Not Recommended,"While the game play of overwatch can be fun, it's over shadowed by the greedy developers that have milked this game of every possible cent they can. Skins that are basic recolors are worth more than they should ever be and unlocking skins passively has become nigh impossible unless you feel like waiting months and months to get only one for free. Overwatch classic was abandoned for three straight years in the promise of this new release. The only reason there's a two next to the title is because the developers promised us an expansive PvE game mode that would have interesting missions and unique skill trees to unlock. Rather than do all that the developers canceled this update, released the 2nd game with barley any changes at all, and profited. Not a single item in this games store or DLC page is worth a cent of your money. The game play is fun but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ greed ruined the experience"
yoshi,0,August 11,5,,0,Not Recommended,"From heroes to zeros, Blizzard's trajectory is a typical short-sighted, greedy, capitalistic fall from grace.It's one thing to evolve a game, but to essentially hijack our initial monetary and time investment by completely removing Overwatch1 and forcing us into Overwatch2 is beyond manipulative, it's a calculated betrayal.""Heroes never die"" was the rallying cry of a game I once loved. But seeing how OW2 and Blizzard are in their death throes, goes to show they were never the ""heroes"", they just pretended.Given the trash they've produced, Blizzard, together with its internal garbage they call ""execs"", should be hung out to dry. They've taken a masterpiece and mutilated it for their petty gains, althewhile abusing their own employees, taking the community for fools and thinking we'll just forget if they give us a few shiny things. Buying this game is like funding the mafia. Behind closed doors they engage in abhorrent behaviour thinking nobody will find out. Joke's on them, the world found out!The legacy of Blizzard's harm, highlighted by the death of Kerri Moynihan at the hands of Blizzard's sexual abuse, is their indelible stain. I hope all those involved in the abuse experience 10 times the pain of Kerri. If they were all lined up to be flogged, I'd buy front row tickets and request an encore.May you burn in hell Blizzard, together with all of your decision makers.

-=๖CŽﮔ=- ℓιℓ sqυιɗ,0,August 11,5,,0,Not Recommended,"Well, Overwatch 2 is finally on Steam. Let's look back on what has happened up to this point.✓ Game of the Year 2016.✓ Incredible Cinematics.✓ Amazing diversity of Characters.✓ Solid gameplay with a variety of habilities and ways to play.✓ Spearhead of eSports becoming mainstream with Overwatch League.✓ Stadiums, Merch, events with VAs, special announcements.✓ Incredibly talented artists that make visually impressive content such as skins, maps, even sound.✓ Lootboxes that were pretty generous if the player just plays for a little while per week, easy to get all the new content being released.✓ Over 40M copies sold...X Several grave controversies involving the company.X For a game with a setting about being included and being a hero, they completely blocked people's words and desperation in a time of need for Hong Kong.X Stopped giving constant updates, got lazy.X Very bad patch notes that were unable to break a boring meta that stayed relevant for over an entire year.X Unable to fix several issues that plagued the first game such as toxicity, smurfing, broken strats.X A very good lore, but painfully slow to actually develop and progress to the point where majority doesn't care about it anymore.X Broken promises.X Overwatch 1 was left to rot and suffer a slow death while all their focus were on Overwatch 2 for almost 3 whole years.X Papa Jeff is gone.So, what is Overwatch 2? It's is supposed to be a rebirth, make the game relevant and incredible again. It's nothing more than a fresh coat of paint to Overwatch 1 with a few key differences. PvE, the main advertisement of the game and the ""reason"" it exists won't ever be released, so all those lost years of suffering a dying game was for nothing.Blizzard now shows their true predatory nature, the game does not respect you. New heroes have to be unlocked on the Battle Pass, the progress is extremely slow, the rewards are often not worth it with the exception of the final tiers. No way to unlock content faster without paying a large amount of money. Toxicity and other issues from 1 are still present.● Game looks incredible and runs very well too, lots of graphical customization.● Gameplay is solid, many different characters and ways to approach a game and situation.● Many QoL features.● It's free.● Requires a battle.net account.● Not many active players, especially on higher tier of competitive.● Increasingly complex the more characters are added, not friendly with new players.I've spent hundreds of hours on OW1 when it came out, and played for plenty of years until 2019. Nowadays considering everything Blizzard has done, it makes me incredibly sad with just how low this franchise reached. All the broken promises, incredibly missing opportunities, bad takes and choices, it saddens for me to say this but it just doesn't deserve to be mainstream anymore. Try the game if you'd like, some of my favorite memories in all of gaming came from Highlights of OW1 but with the direction OW2 is going, I won't be a part of it."

I've played this game 7 years and it feels like my trust was gained in the first 4 and then exploited in the last 3. Overwatch was genuinely a life saver in high school, but the company decided that money was better than player trust and happiness. I pray this era of live service gaming comes to an end, and companies start making complete products again. I've watched every Blizzard series die at this point and it feels like they took Bungie with them. I feel ashamed to have once been called a fan of Activsion Blizzard."

Fel,0,August 11,4,,0,Not Recommended,"Don't let the ""Blizzard Entertainment, Inc."" developer & publisher fool you. The Blizzard people loved for so long has been dead for years. It is a corpse puppet Activision uses for marketing purposes, that is all.Overwatch 1 wasn't a perfect game, not by a long shot. But Overwatch 2 is a worse version of Overwatch 1 in every single way. Lets see what bad design choices fall onto the tracks as my train of thought gets rolling...I will preface this with the fact that if they didn't take Overwatch 1 away from everyone that bought it I wouldn't give a ♥♥♥♥ that they released a inferior Free2Play sequel, I would just go play that.5v5 sucks horsecock, I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ what streamers, pros, or the devs say. The majority of players are not pros, if the balance of Overwatch 2 built around such a small segment of the community its no wonder people are quitting the game. Its not like 6v6 was ever perfectly balanced, but I think that it allowed for a bit more freedom when it came to counter-picking. I know that counter-picking is big part of the game and always has been, but 5v5 has made it almost impossible to have fun in the game without selecting meta characters/hard counters (this is doubly true for tanks).6v6 enabled soft-countering, which made it possible for people to play characters they enjoy. It allowed people to pick someone they wanted to play that could contribute to dealing with a particular threat without putting it all on their shoulders. It meant that success or failure in a fight wasn't down to just 1 player death on 1 team deciding who wins that engagement. Also many of the tanks in Overwatch were never built with solo tanking in mind and without complete reworks never can.I know some will say 5v5 was done to solve shield meta. But how ♥♥♥♥ is changing the game to 5v5 and then trying to re-balance everything off that easier than just re-balancing some shield users or their counters?5v5 is why Open Queue and Mystery Heroes are the only main modes its possible to have some fun in.Push sucks horseballs. Assault had its issues, but push just feels like you are going nowhere fast escorting a idiotic robot back and forth(What the ♥♥♥♥ is it pushing? A tall jersey barrier?). Its entirely possible the whole match will take place in quarter of the map as both teams just trade the bot and it goes barely farther one way than the other. You don't feel like anything was accomplished. But its probably a good thing cause the map design is just a lazy mirrored layout. At least with Assault you could change tactics and lineup based on location. And sure some games were steamrolls on attack or defense, but at least it was quick. Charging for early access to characters is pay to win. Just because they can EVENTUALLY be earned doesn't mean they aren't pay to win. And just because other games do it doesn't mean its acceptable. Its a scumbag move no matter who does it. Overwatch 2 coulda earned a couple positive points on the ♥♥♥♥ meter if they didn't do it.What can I say that hasn't already been said about the overpriced cosmetics? Well I could say how they converted Overwatch 1 players' in-game currency into the least valuable type of 3 currencies in Overwatch 2. And how the legendary skins of Overwatch 1 became only available for the 2nd most valuable currency of Overwatch 2. Essentially anyone who hadn't already spent their Overwatch 1 currency had it turned from ""real"" money into monopoly money as far as the game was concerned. But I guess if Activision is willing to steal the game we paid for from us, it is willing to steal our time and money also. They did end up changing this so the old skins were obtainable with that monopoly money, but it doesn't change the fact that they tried to do it. And the new ""gold"" currency is such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ grind to obtain its not even worth trying to get it. Essentially its give them money or you cant get anything new that is cool.Do I even need to talk about the removal of the PvE campaign? How they cancelled it internally at least a year before Overwatch 2 was released but were perfectly happy to use it to market the game and sell garbage for 6 months after release. If you look at the Invasion menu in-game you can even see the broken, frankensteined together hunks of flesh that were gathered from the meat and soul grinder they put their lower level employees into.The moral of the story: Stop giving this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ company your money. It is the only way they will EVER do better.PS I'm calling it now they are going to try to sell us Overwatch Classic"

The reason with they justified making Overwatch 2 (the storymode) in the first place was canceld afterward. They try to rip off the player with minimal efforts like the battle pass or the new skin system. A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ charm costs more ingame than in the real life. You cant get skins for free now and have to pay a lot of money for it.

OW2 is a cashgrab, a wicked attempt to generate more revenue on a popular game they've made years ago, shame for Blizzard, and a bigger shame, because millions of players got screwed over without any compensation.Overwatch 2 is WORSE in EVERY aspect compared to first one, literally. it's much worse version of the game that millions of people bough and loved, and we can never get back the game we paid for."

zero,0,August 11,4,,21,Not Recommended,"Used to be an awesome game with reasonable balance containing some fair and unfair moments in it, but still fun to play. Game speed was optimal. Gameplay was clear and visible. There was pretty high entry threshold on some heroes but it felt rewarding to master them.But now its all gone. Each new character generete tons of particals and effects that preventing you from orienting in game, even on low graphics. After switching to 5v5 mode game speed increased drastically wich affects heavily on aim and movement. Becouse of that you constantly feel unsatisfied in fights even if your team is winning.And of course monetization issues and broken promises. How would you feel when your favorite game you once bought suddenly becoming f2p (p2p if you want to play new heroes on their release date) with battlepass system. Game where you could get all event customization items just playing it, instead of buying them in shop for $15 each. When last hope of what ow2 deserves to be dies with promised pve content.You would feel empty. I certanly am."

You also have to pay separately for the new PvE content, since you cant use the coin if you extra beforehand.Protect your kids from this predatory practicesThe only content youre gonna get is 'Hero damage is reduced/increased by 0.5', same game map design with the same game mode, game mode that being stole from other game (cant come up with new game mode), a new hero locked behind a battlepass that you have to pay for or ♥♥♥♥ you wait next season, and skins, you just get a bunch of free old recolor skin so you can feel bad about yourself and prey on that for you to spend money on a skin to make yourself feel good, until new skin comes in.

Disgusting, blatant cash grab.After neglecting (initially really fun game, promising to be the next great brand) the original OW to death and forcing players to switch to OW2 (yes, it is not possible to play original anymore) everything went downhill.Oh, and just to remind and highlight the fact: the original OW was a full-price game; after enjoying it with my family and friends since 2016 all we got in OW was some lousy badges and an access to one new character.Anticipated story mode? Straight to the bin, there wasn't even an attempt to implement it.""Free to play"" model? That's just an excuse to rake in skins and other cosmetics money from not-knowing-any-better players (previously, obtainable for free - loot boxes mechanics might have been a tiresome, random grind, but hey - those are just cosmetics, in the end).New characters introduced periodically? Well, that is one thing they kept to, but still - they put a paywall in front of it (battle pass, season pass or whatever they call it).In conclusion: after hundreds of enjoyable hours spent in the original OW, but with OW2 I am just disappointed in how they treated the player base and the game itself.

Aziz-Alrafaei,1,August 11,4,,0,Not Recommended,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."
Falcon,0,August 11,5,,58,Not Recommended,"Blizzard's decision to lock Overwatch story missions behind a paywall is nothing short of a slap in the face to its loyal fanbase. It's a brazen move that reeks of corporate greed, showing a total disregard for the gamers who have supported the franchise since its inception.Let's start by recalling the initial promise. Overwatch-1 was a paid title. Gamers spent their hard-earned money, investing not just financially but emotionally in a game that, while primarily a competitive shooter, tantalized with a rich backstory and a world filled with lore. The prospect of Overwatch-2 offering PVE story missions was a shimmering beacon of hope for many. It was a chance for fans to delve deeper into the world they had grown to love, to connect with the characters on a level that went beyond just the competitive arena.However, what transpired was a series of broken promises and missed opportunities. After years of teasing Overwatch 2, the company decided to cancel it altogether. It's a move that left many feeling betrayed. Gamers had committed countless hours, bolstering the community, creating content, and sharing their passion for the Overwatch universe, only to be left high and dry.And now, the audacity to reintroduce story missions, but at a staggering $15 for just three missions? It's a move that feels more like a cynical cash grab than a genuine effort to provide content. For context, many AAA titles with intricate stories, hours of gameplay, and cutting-edge graphics are available at prices that make Blizzard's offering look like daylight robbery.Overwatch's allure was never just about the gameplay. It was about the world, the characters, and the stories that tied them all together. It was about the emotional investment players made into this universe. But with this latest move, it's evident that Blizzard views its players not as fans, but as mere dollar signs.Comparing it to other games, the value proposition is laughable. But even more than that, it's a sad reflection of how far Blizzard has strayed from its once-storied reputation of being a company that prioritized its fans. Today, it seems they are more interested in short-term financial gains than in nurturing the community that made them a gaming giant.In conclusion, locking the Overwatch story missions behind such an exorbitant paywall is not just bad business—it's a stark betrayal of trust.

Don't waste your time: it's an unbalanced, buggy, mtx ridden shell of the original.At least they released this travesty on steam, so everyone can see what's the community's opinion on it.R34 is still going strong tho, so that's something."
Bathius,2,August 11,4,,1,Not Recommended,"I've had Overwatch 1 through 2  when it first came out and 1 was great (loot boxes feel way better than a SCAM OF A BATTLE PASS). My final conclusion is that blizzard has the same mindset as someone who thought the American School System was a great idea today. An example of their stupidity is from today where I was playing the game because of the new character and I see it as my favorite support so far. I was also surprised that the character was FREE finally; which makes sense for a game where meta matters (I mean, every other fighting games has the same problem; but that's besides the point). BUT...but but but...the servers all of the sudden did an ""update"" where she's only available where YOU HAVE TO BUY HER IF YOU DON'T WANNA PLAY 50+ GAMES. That'll takes way to long; AND IMAGINE FOR THE OTHER CHARACTERS WHEN THEY WERE ON THE BATTLEPASS. IMAGINE GOING THROUGH THESE CHARACTERS ONE BY ONE THROUGH BATTLEPASS OR EVEN THE CHALLENGES. When i was looking at lifeweaver. It wanted me to play 35 games of open queue which is completely stupid. If i want to  play the characters I have to do those 200+ matches of games quite possibly or buy them. BUYING THEM IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ANY OTHER FIGHTING GAME CHARACTER. Fighting game DLC is usually like 5 bucks per a character or 20 bucks for a whole season of characters which isn't much. BUT THIS GAME; IT'S 10 DOLLARS PER A CHARACTER ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP! YOU'RE SPENDING 50 + (15 FOR THE BATTLEPASS) DOLLARS TO PLAY THE CHARACTERS THIS IS ONLY FOR A 6 CHARACTERS VS A SEASON PASS THAT'LL COST YOU 20 BUCKS FOR 6 OR MORE. GUESS WHAT; FIGHTING GAMES ALSO PROVIDE FREE CONTENT SUCH AS PVE WITHOUT MAKING YOU SPEND MORE THAN WHAT YOU'VE PURCHASED OR EVEN A FREE FIGHTING GAME. While that's one problem of the game; there's another, being a big fat liar. THEY'VE PROMISED SO MUCH BUT NEVER DELIVERED A SINGLE TIME IN THEIR LIFE. PVE, CUT EVERYTHING THAT WAS PROMISED, LOCKING HEROES WHEN THEY SAID THEY WON'T, AND MANY MORE THAT I DON'T WANT TO FIND AND BE SAD ABOUT. I don't know how you fail a game harder than any other game I've ever seen. How the hell does Paladins have a better hero unlocking system than OW2. TEAM FORTRESS 2 HAS LESS SUPPORT BUT A BETTER FREE TO PLAY SYSTEM THEN ANY OTHER GAME I'VE EVER SEEN. Illari was literally my favorite hero in the support role and I can't play her without banging my head against the wall 50 times. ♥♥♥♥ you blizzard and I hope you go bankrupt."

wildwingBat,0,August 11,5,,0,Not Recommended,"Overwatch 1 was way better than Overwatch 2, and it isn't close. Overwatch 2 is a mobile-looking, budget version of what Overwatch 1 was. The game feels like a free for all with zero structure compared to Overwatch 1. It is significantly easier to climb the ranked ladder in OW2, causing an inflation of diamond players infesting GM/T500 matchmaking, taking away any competitiveness the game used to have. They purposely did not release content in OW1 for YEARS in order to push out this false-advertised, TRASH downgrade from what could've been. The worst part is they are just now proving they have the resources and are completely capable of maintaining the game, so why didn't they just do that in the first place? Every time I log on this game, I'm reminded why Overwatch 1 was so much better and I think about what could've been. Do not support this company. Do not be led on by their constant lies.I like the roadhog rework though! ...oh wait"
Kunio,0,August 11,5,,0,Not Recommended,"If you're looking for a fun, rewarding team-based FPS, look elsewhere. Overwatch was probably my most played game in 2016 and 2017. Got every achievement (Prior to Doomfist) on the PS4 version and had an absolute ball with it. I'm not sure what was going on in the heads of the developers between then and now. But what is it now? A ton of false promises to distract us from the many awful things Blizzard has done. Heck, I'd even be able to live with that if the game was fun to make progress on, but now it's just battlepasses and other predatory forms of microtransactions. Every new hero use to be free so that nobody was left in the dust when it came to learning how they worked, and thus learning how to counter them. Now, the only way to learn is by forking over some cash.Overwatch 1 had lootboxes, yes, but at least you can play to earn those back then and still get neat skins and whatnot without spending a nickle. This game really is just a shadow of what it use to be. More content won't fix the game."
✱MarioBlue22✱,0,August 11,7,,0,Not Recommended,"Although I will be trying whatever is left of the PvE can't say I will pick the game back up at this current time, what at first was a good idea to remove 1 tank turned into a unfun game of punching bag where if your the tank, your the punching bag.DPS has the most variety but that's because they are 75% of the roster.Support is as fun as DPS with the down side of having not many to choose from making the role stale after a while.The battle pass does little to excite me outside of the mythics skin most of the time, with many cosmetics being horribly over priced ranging from 10-20 bucks for 1 skin which sucks if the cool skin you like turns out to be 20 bucks.Balance changes are back and forth half the time being changes that aren't all that impactful to changes that are so out of left field they get reverted or overly nerfed next patch.As a tank main I simply refuse to really pick the game back up due to either not having fun relying on my team to do things to constantly being called out for being bad (skill issue) and outside of giving the PvE a shot (review been made before trying it out) I don't know if I will ever fully play the game again.Post One pve mission/watching a friend play the rest opinion:it's not worth the $15 for 3 missions, the cutscenes are well made and the banter is pretty good, but its basically like missions from overwatch 1, you play it one time and that's about it, only unique things are the enemies with the down side of it being scripted spawns instead of random spawns seen in left 4 dead or deep rock galactic.Also blizzard bad, there I said it."

Imrür,1,August 10,28,2,0,Not Recommended,"Overwatch 2: A Step Back for the FranchiseI recently had the opportunity to play Overwatch 2 and, unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. What was once an innovative and dynamic franchise seems to have taken a turn for the worse, favoring the financial exploitation of players over creativity and commitment to a quality gaming experience.At the core of my disappointment is the fact that Overwatch 2 feels more like a costly update than a genuine sequel. Despite the change in title, the game has failed to introduce significant changes or improvements that warrant the financial investment it demands.The first point of disappointment was the introduction of the paid Season Pass. What should have been a chance to explore new heroes turned out to be a frustrating experience, having to ""farm"" the Season Pass to unlock them. This approach seems contradictory to the spirit of fairness and accessibility that once made Overwatch famous.Another significant issue that reflects poorly on the game's management was the balance changes. The rebalancing was so poorly executed that two characters, Torbjörn and Bastion, had to be temporarily removed from the game. This is a clear indication of the lack of foresight and testing before implementing such changes.I was also shocked by Blizzard's decision to cancel the PvE mode, reducing the scope of the game. It seems that the financial success of Diablo Immortal, which brings in $2 million a day thanks to the Asian market, led to this decision. Instead of investing in new features to enrich the game, the shift towards selling skins at €20 gives the impression of a lack of creativity and ambition.A significant issue was a bug that forced the purchase of paid skins, and Blizzard's response was to not provide refunds. This behavior raises serious concerns about Blizzard's regard for its player base and overall business practices.The removal of Assault mode, replaced by Push mode, did not contribute to enriching the gaming experience either. This gives the impression of stagnation rather than progression in the game design.As for the reward system, the more you play, the less you earn. This is discouraging and seems to go against the objective of any game - to encourage players to spend more time playing.In terms of technical issues, the game is far from stable. Bugs and crashes are frequent, hindering a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.Finally, while veteran players can transfer their skins, newcomers to Overwatch 2 face an almost insurmountable financial or temporal wall. To acquire the complete collection of skins from the first opus, they will have to spend about $10,000 or play for 327 years. Even for smaller collections, like Kitsune's, one must either spend $156 or play for 5 years.In conclusion, Overwatch 2 is a disappointment. Instead of innovating and pushing the boundaries, it seems that Blizzard has chosen to favor financial exploitation. Given the upcoming acquisition of Blizzard by Xbox, I earnestly hope we will see a shift in the company's direction. Here's hoping that Xbox can help steer Blizzard back to its roots of quality and creativity, putting an end to these recent questionable practices.Overwatch 2 Invasion - 15€Ultimate Invasion - 40€Heros Collection - 5€Ultimate Heros Collection - 20€LOL.I still don't know why people still playing Blizzard games ..."

BasJack,0,August 11,18,,0,Not Recommended,"Preface, i played 243 hours on overwatch, most on 1 and a couple of really depressing ones on 2. Reached gold before burning out and level 302.I loved overwatch 1 it was like TF2 on steroids, more compact, focused and with character with a richer skill set. Got hooked up, trained my aim, got quite good. Unfortunately soon after i joined (around season 2) all friends playing quit because they got burned by season 1 competitive (which apparently was hell on earth). So i started playing alone and ranking, eventually reached gold and burned out. It was around the time they started the Overwatch league that all the problems started to really sprout. Updates to the meta became slow because ♥♥♥♥ if a 16 years old that is getting payed to play a video game can be expected to adapt to changes in a game. Atrocious decisions on character balance and reworks, born from the all inclusive style of character planned but the extremely competitive nature of the game (Symmetra melted people without havint to aim, Junkrat shooting grenades at random and now doesn't even take damage, i think that still stands) or just bad ideas alltogheter (Mercy Valkirye update because Mercy players where hiding like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and using their overpowered Ultimate to res a whole team after a fight). Not to mention fun charachters immediately nerfed (Ashe).I kept following from a distance, sometimes coming back, have a couple of games and then quitting againTHAT SAID: Overwatch 2 is the worse update the game could ever have, it's a sort of miracle for how bad it ♥♥♥♥♥ up and lessens what was a great game, not understand what made the game great.Let's start with a slimy note, I bought Overwatch 1, i also bought a couple of lootboxes (like an idiot). If you delete the game, make a ""second"" and bring all the skins from the first and put ridicolous prices on them, I that bought and supported the first game should have them all, they were bundled with the first game, even if the caveat was that you had to ""earn"" (random) them. Or at least i should be able to keep earning them in the 2. It would also help the game because them there is nothing to strive for in the game, except some dumb achievement. I won't even count those challenges that give so little currency that it would take years to earn anything meaningful.Now no matter what all the brainlet streamers say, the change to 5v5 from 6v6 is the worse decision they could make, especially with the locked roles.  There is a reason why even when roles where free there was always at least 2 tanks. Between 2 points pass 1 line. 2 tanks made a wall behind which the team could hide, move, change shooting angle, try flanks confident that the team could hold for a little. With just 1 tank, even with a huge health bar, no wall can be built, the only hope is to huddle up behind it and hope it doesn't die, if it does the whole team is ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The only meta is now deathball, if someone tries to flank, as soon as it gets spotted by the other huddled team it gets shredded. The only one that could do it and have fun is Sombra (my main in 1 that brought me to burning because i was adamant in using her in competitive and climbing rank, when soldier would've been a thousand times easier but boring). I'm sure soon after they nerfed Sombra to the ground but i didn't stick to see.Another huge change is the lack of crowd controls. I at least get the idea of this, the first person nature of the game makes crowd controls feel awful, you are forced to just see the screen and wait. Problem is the game was built with them in mind. McCree(don't remember the new name) neeeeds them to survive, otherwise everyone can just push right into his face and melt him. And if the problem was that for him was a easy way for him to get headshot, i'd say skill issue, i had a 70% precision with him at my top, no flashbang needed to get headshots. Last the PVE, they worked a lot on it (allegedly) then dropped and scaled it down. Problem is they are asking a stupid price for it (Shadows of Change much?) like they are selling what was originally planned but in reality they find out they could sell the PvE events that used to be free, truly a genius move. As genius as putting the game on Steam. And Gabe i better not see you delete reviews because of ""brigading"", This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ revies/rant is a long time comingSorry for it, maybe i will come back and write it again better, i doubt it."

Saint,0,August 11,10,,1,Not Recommended,"for anyone looking for a serious review explaining why OW2 has a (at time of writing) 10% positive score:they took an incredibly fun game in OverWatch 1, and applied layers of terrible systems on top of it to destroy any sense of fun and replace it with monetization.free loot boxes when you level up? gone. Now there are 5 different currencies and skins are ~$15+ apiece.Battle Pass: a relatively good battle pass, bogged down by useless filler items like ""souvenirs"" that are literally just static 3d models your character holds over their head like you just opened a box in a zelda game, and a new currency that is extremely restricted and intentionally looks similar to the premium currency.gameplay: Matchmaking can take upwards of 5 minutes, and you're STILL not going to get a balanced team. As someone who's been playing the game since OW1 release, I routinely get matched with brand new players who have no idea what they're doing. Balance is terrible, where healers are now responsible for all of the healing AND damage, if you don't have a healer who can keep up with both easily, you're not going to clear the enemy team and you're not going to win. period. Games tend to flip between completely stomping and getting completely stomped, ruining all of the fun of a hard match.Menus: they reworked the entire Menu to look like a mobile game, it feels cheap, like overwatch is a cheap knockoff of itself now."

ImBobbyMuddah,0,August 16,4,,0,Not Recommended,"Prepare yourself for a mind-boggling experience that defies all expectations of incompetence. If you thought the previous installment was a masterpiece, then get ready to have your hopes and dreams crushed like bugs under the boot of mediocrity. This sequel is less of a step forward and more of a headfirst plunge into the abyss of laziness and disregard for player satisfaction.Remember those crisp, cutting-edge graphics that left you in awe last time? Well, buckle up, because this time around, the developers decided to treat your eyes to a visually unappealing spectacle that looks like it was designed on a calculator from the 90s. The ""upgrades"" are so stunningly underwhelming that it's hard to believe this wasn't just a cheap attempt to cash in on the previous success.Gameplay? Oh, don't you worry – they managed to take a perfectly good formula and somehow make it worse. The controls feel like they were designed by someone who's never held a controller in their life. Forget about the smooth, responsive gameplay you used to enjoy; now you'll be struggling just to get your character to do the most basic actions without feeling like you're wrestling with a drunk octopus.And let's not forget about the stunning lack of innovation. If you were hoping for new maps, exciting game modes, or anything remotely fresh, prepare to be disappointed. This game takes recycling to a whole new level, as it shamelessly regurgitates the same old content, as if hoping you won't notice the stench of stagnation.But wait, there's more! The sound design is a symphony of disappointment, featuring uninspired weapon sounds that are about as menacing as a kitten's purr. The soundtrack seems to have been composed by someone who just discovered the ""default"" setting on their synthesizer.It's genuinely impressive how the developers managed to strip away every ounce of enjoyment from a previously beloved franchise. This sequel feels less like a game and more like an elaborate practical joke played on unsuspecting fans. If you're looking for a masterclass in how to take a promising franchise and drive it straight into the ground, congratulations – you've found your golden ticket.In conclusion, this sequel is the gaming equivalent of a soggy cardboard box left out in the rain: sad, unappealing, and destined for the trash heap of forgotten failures. If you're a glutton for punishment and have an insatiable craving for disappointment, then by all means, give this game a shot. For the rest of us who value our time and sanity, it's best to avoid this abomination like the plague."

From the very beginning, a solid and engaging PVE was what I wanted most out of the game. I played PVP to death and burnt out, but I still consider the original Overwatch to be my favorite PVP game ever made. If they had been able to deliver an equivalent experience in PVE, this review would be positive in spite of the multiple awful things surrounding PVP and Blizzard as a whole.I'm someone who can deal with a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Brig's release, GOATs, Role Lock (Definitely the worst update in terms of game enjoyment, even worse than Brig), and the three year content drought were not enough to dissuade me from playing the game because I could always feel the passion from the dev team behind the project. I still miss playing heroes like Reinhardt, Roadhog, and Junkrat, but I can no longer gaslight myself into supporting a product that so heinously prioritizes grabbing at your wallet over actual quality. They're only after your wallet, plain and simple. Blizzard failed to realize that short-term profit boosts from battlepasses and $20 skins completely screwed their games reputation and dwindled their player numbers. They're trying to build a multiplatform brand out of Overwatch, but it will fail because even their most diehard fans from the early years no longer care about the game. They should have prioritized keeping their players happy over their investors, as their long-term financial gains from multiplatforming would have been massive. On top of making OW2 and objective downgrade from the first, you cannot go back and play OW1 (which millions paid money for), which makes this stain on the game industry an even bigger kick to the ♥♥♥♥. OW2 is the pinnacle of what gamers mean when they talk about why ""modern gaming sucks."" Abysmal predatory microtransactions, inconsistent at best ""live service"", tone deaf lead company and developers, and a lack of passion and direction. Their eyes were on the money and they choked out their golden goose. I'm surprised to see that at the time of writing, this game only has a 13% positive review on steam. It should definitely be lower. The Microsoft acquisition isn't going to save Overwatch, the dream is dead. If you still support this game (especially monetarily), please take a long look at many of the negative reviews and figure out why people don't like it instead of blindly acting as Blizzard's PR lapdog. If you aren't bothered by the issues people have, enjoy the game. But I can promise you that they will only disappoint you in the future with half-baked updates and illusions of a grand future."

You can get teams that just plow through the enemy team and you get teams where every single team member thinks they're Rambo and can solo the entire enemy team.

KingKrouch,0,August 10,8,,1,Not Recommended,"This is just Overwatch 2, but on Steam. No launcher nonsense (Take notes EA, Rockstar, and Ubisoft) here. Seemingly works fine on Linux via Proton as well. No complaints with how the Steam release has been handled so far.Blizzard also added FSR 2.2 for those interested, and honestly, even with the max render percentage of 67% in this mode, it looks better than native res with just SMAA. Just make sure the game runs at a high framerate (120 or higher), as TAA greatly benefits from more frame data to work with.Can't stand the monetization of this game, how much of a meme the changing meta has become, or the way Blizzard handles their PR or workspace culture though, so that might be a downside for you. I wish they'd just release a proper map editor, add LAN support, and user-hosted dedicated server tools already.I've always felt like BattleNet was antiquated, and the launcher really didn't have a reason to exist even back in the 2010's. Now just release good games again and fix up your workspace culture, and maybe I'll buy a full priced game from you again."
zee.dragon,0,August 21,5,,0,Not Recommended,"This game is ruined by the greedy monetization practices of the current live service game landscape. Note that I bought the original Overwatch but then was forced to get Overwatch 2, when the game was just Overwatch the game was 40 dollars, and everything that was essential to the core gameplay loop which literally was just all of the heroes came with the game. Skins were not a factor for me but I got most of them through literally playing the game and events and got most of them as I did buy the Pink Mercy skin as it was for charity. Now the game is free to play and you have to buy, buy, buy to have a full core gameplay loop which involves having all of the heroes as you are picking and countering picking heroes throughout a single match.Additionally, all new skins from what I can tell you can only choose to purchase and there is no free currency to get them as the free currency from the free Battle Pass is only for classic skins for what I can see meaning Overwatch, not Overwatch 2 skins and for the Overwatch 2 skins, it seems to be the practice of fear of missing out.With that, I feel they made the change to force people to pay to win with their wallet from my perspective, and for no other reason than a literal bait and switch of products and providing empty promises (this should honestly be illegal if you ask me). One of the promises is the Hero Mode (this Mode was not a thing I was interested in but my friends and community were), which was supposed to be a free PvE/story/progression/hero trees system that was removed. Mind you that this was the whole point of Overwatch 2, or at least that's how it was marketed, toward consumers. Now they made it into an empty shell of a PvE mode that you now need to pay for whenever a new one comes out it seems.Additionally, they removed most of the crowd control mechanics of affecting the enemy at first launch for Overwatch 2 to just add back into the game for the Hero called Lifeweaver to affect your teammates which if you do not know this player and are not in communication together can lead to you want to do something and then all of a sudden being literally YEETED in a placement you did not want and in most cases, the hero does this to get teammates killed or be their bullet sponge as they are about to die (most cases they die anyway) for this reason they tend to get the title trolls and can turn a game from 5v5 to a 4v6.If what I said sounds like a game and company that you want to support then go ahead and be roped into a one-side step and then take a mile steps back as they never took a step forward from my viewpoint. If this is not a game and company that you want to support I would suggest staying away from it for the newcomers on this platform.If things change to a better state then, I may update this but this is just my honest opinion on the current state of the game as it stands."

Play the game like its a full-time job to unlock a hero or pay $ to unlock it quickly. The whole reason this game was called Overwatch 2 was because of the anticipated PVE which got canned and turned into £12 DLC which is nothing special and the same as archive missions we once got for FREE.Heroes are locked behind paywall unless you grind in a team-based game with counters involved. New players who couldn't play OW1 are being charged for skins you could unlock for free for the last 5 years and basically this sequel wasn't needed. Greed."

"Throbert ""Based"" Johnson",0,August 11,6,,0,Not Recommended,"Overwatch 2 has seemingly deviated from its prior deference to players, adopting a veneer of continuity from its predecessor while effectively pursuing pecuniary gain.In the year 2016, I initially engaged with the game and, akin to numerous others, promptly became enamored by its allure. Overwatch continued to occupy a prominent position among my preferred shooters throughout subsequent years, even during the period marked by a paucity of content leading to the advent of OW2.While the title retains its endearing design, captivating ensemble of characters, and commendable multiplayer maps, Overwatch 2 has introduced notable deviations that cast a pall over its foundational essence. Permit me to elucidate:#1 - Restriction of Heroes within the Sphere of the Battlepass FrameworkForemost among these alterations is the confinement of heroes within the parameters of the Battlepass framework, an alteration of profound significance.Overwatch is grounded in the selection of heroes and the orchestration of team dynamics. Each distinct character confers unique advantages, with varying degrees of compatibility or incongruity. In its previous iteration, Overwatch periodically introduced new heroes to its player base, fostering an inclusive environment devoid of financial barriers. However, Overwatch 2 now demands either a protracted commitment to the acquisition of new heroes or pecuniary expenditure via the Battlepass to gain access upon release (or a fee of £9 for established heroes).Though superficially innocuous, this transformation bears consequence as players can partake in competitive gameplay with an incomplete hero roster.This presents a crucial facet of gameplay sequestered behind a monetary threshold, a construct that runs counter to principles of competitive parity.How can equitable competition persist when one cohort of players possesses a plethora of options solely due to financial disbursement? The semblance to a ""pay-to-win"" model is discernible, though I defer to your discretion in formulating this judgment.#2 - The Battlepass Framework and the Evolution of Cosmetic AestheticsMy disposition toward the concept of the Battlepass framework has heretofore been one of tempered concurrence; however, when juxtaposed with analogous implementations in other gaming contexts, OW2's iteration is decidedly wanting. Each iteration of the Battlepass proffers an assemblage of 80 tiers of rewards, conventionally encompassing 8 distinct skins (augmented by an admirably customizable variant as the culmination), alongside sundry ancillary accoutrements, as is the norm. This latter category encompasses designations, insignias, and gestures. It warrants mention that a recent addition includes ""credits,"" a commendable augmentation, yet one that falls short of rectifying the foundational error of entrenching pivotal gameplay attributes behind a monetary barrier.The role of cosmetics within Overwatch has historically been of pivotal import, epitomized by the creations of accomplished artists and modelers responsible for crafting superlative skins. The aesthetic merit of these offerings endures, yet their valuation is characterized by audacity. Notably, legendary skins, denoting designs beyond mere chromatic reconfigurations, approximate an average price point of £20 or more per unit.Heretofore, these cosmetic items were obtainable through the mechanism of lootboxes, awarded with each advancement in player level, a frequency that could be deemed appreciable. In my personal trajectory within the game, my engagement with direct box purchases was intermittent, yet I managed to amass a substantial collection of skins spanning various characters. The rationale often cited in defense of the transition to a commercial model was predicated on the notion that the extant munificence of the lootbox system was compromising fiscal viability, an assertion I find subject to dispute. Evidently, by the year 2019, a mere triennium post-launch, Overwatch had amassed a cumulative revenue of $1 billion through the medium of lootboxes.Presently, avenues for acquiring cosmetic embellishments devoid of fiscal exchange are notably restricted, unless one is inclined to endure protracted trials to secure a singular legendary skin over a span of months.#3 - The Praxis of PvE ImplementationWhile my personal inclination seldom gravitated toward Player versus Environment (PvE) experiences, it is imperative to note that this facet was heralded as a focal pillar underpinning the narrative of Overwatch 2's proposition.In principle, that was the prevailing tenor; however, the eventual manifestation transpired as a bait-and-switch maneuver, ostensibly orchestrated to facilitate the integration of novel monetization mechanisms. Curiously, even in the wake of the ostensibly delineated cessation of PvE endeavors, discrete PvE missions persist, albeit available as individualized acquisitions, serving as yet another conduit to extract monetary remuneration.In Conclusive RecapitulationFor devotees of competitive shooters, Overwatch 2 appears to be wanting in its adherence to the principles undergirding competitive integrity.For adherents of the cosmetic acquisition facet, Overwatch 2 necessitates a financial commitment of significant magnitude.While the factor of amusement remains extant, thereby retaining vestiges of the gratifying experience that once resonated, its essence is overshadowed by the intrusion of acquisitive proclivities to an extent that compels me to withhold endorsement for discerning enthusiasts."

Gummientchen,0,August 10,3,,0,Not Recommended,"I entered the Overwatch universe through its second installment, primarily due to friends. Not having experienced the first game, I was eager for Overwatch 2's launch. Sadly, my excitement was overshadowed by the letdown of unfulfilled PvE promises. Instead of substantial improvements, we got weekly PvE missions that mirrored the ones in Overwatch 1. The introduction of paid options for skins that used to be free in Overwatch 1 felt like a bait-and-switch. The Overwatch 2 release with minimal advancements left me questioning the choices made by the developers.My experience with matchmaking has been frustrating. It struggles to pair players of equal skill, resulting in an unsatisfying gameplay environment. Furthermore, the change from 6-player teams to 5-player teams feels imbalanced and has had a negative impact on my overall enjoyment.While playing Overwatch 2 with friends has had its enjoyable moments, the unfulfilled promises and the issues with matchmaking and team balance have left me feeling cheated by the developers/publisher. This makes it hard for me to recommend the game wholeheartedly."
SmashinVP,0,August 10,5,,0,Not Recommended,"So I do like Overwatch, never played enough Overwatch 1, so I was excited to play the game with friends again when Overwatch 2 came out.

The Skill tree got completely removed. Old Overwatch 1 skins that were free now are in the store to be bought with real money. Also Overwatch 2 came out so much later with so little changes to Overwatch 1 that you wonder what the leadership at Blizzard was/is doing.When Overwatch 2 launched, do to bugs and glitches, you essentially had less then when Overwatch 1 was out. They have fixed most things to my knowledge.There is more to type out here, but I feel like that is enough.

Darkdrinker12,0,August 22,7,,1,Not Recommended,"Once upon a time this game showed a lot of promice.  The game had a fun element to it, lots of fun new characters, and playing it was a bit of a good time.  Then came the Drought.  Things became more... static.  less new characters, less maps, and less fun.  Then came Overwatch 2.  Which promised an expansive PVE experience, a more coherent story line, and elements to bring onboard the non-pvp crowd.  To make this happen they said they would need to revamp the game, rebuild it.  But, we were promised that Overwatch 1 would continue.  Both games would continue side by side.Feel free to look up what happened.  In the end, there is no expansive PVE content, the dual game format was changed and Overwatch 1 died to allow Overwatch 2 to paywall the game away and strip features, free content is now paid content, free characters are now payed characters....  This game is a mess.  Its a hellscape of pay to win content, dividing its player base into the Have Battle Pass players and the Free to Play players.  Blizard has made it clear that they do not plan to make good on this games potental, they would rather harvest money from its loyal fans.This game is a disappointment across the board.  Do somethign better with your money.  Like play the Avengers game from Squaresoft.  That game is more honest that this mess."

Command217,0,August 13,5,,0,Not Recommended,"Overwatch has lost its way, it’s time we Petras Act it and move on. I have 2,259 hours in OW and that’s only including time in matches. Any time in the menu’s, in queue, PTR, and OW2 beta are excluded. It used to be such a great game, but it was left behind to chase a dream that ended up being a pile of cancellations and disappointment. It has been mismanaged for years now which has led the game to a place where they release minimal content, are oblivious to the games issues and even if they weren’t, are too incompetent to be able to fix them. There has been a very clear brain drain over at Blizzard across all teams and they clearly have lost a critical mass of their employee skills and knowledge as a result. Their patches show a clear misunderstanding of how the game has been balanced in the past, recreating major issues that we had thought the OW team had learned from. The team made a gamble to try to deliver on a dream to make an incredible story that would have lots of replay ability, customization, and lore. They completely failed and in the end, they decided to cancel it all. They scrapped the plan and decided not to tell the player base until several months later, all the while trying to recoup the losses of their failure from the last 5 years. In order to do this the game has turned into an extremely greedy cash grab with very little effort going into the game anymore. The game is destined to die in a pit of despair as its failures amount to digging it into a deeper and deeper hole until it reaches hell itself. Those of us who put our time and money into the game will move on to bigger and better things as heroes never die."

Ive put thousands of hours into Overwatch since I started playing in 2017 and Ive experienced every rank from Bronze to Top500, but Overwatch 2 doesnt feel like Overwatch. Blizzard has made too many mistakes in the recent years and its completely killed off my excitement for the game. Transitioning to 5v5, cancellation of the PVE, the terrible shop prices, and the locking of heroes behind battle-pass levels are just a few mistakes off the top of my head. The only things I can think of to fix Overwatch 2 would be bringing back 6v6, improving the battle-pass, fixing shop prices, and completing the PVE. I know none of these things will happen due to the insane amounts of money they're making but OW2 isnt the game I fell in love with. If I had to summarize the current state of the game it would be ""Stockholm Syndrome."" Pretty please Blizzard, fix your game.-JeffyJA"

And through it all, the dev team just refuses to admit what they have done to this game and insists that ""all is well"".   Every time I play this game now, I pray to God that Valve makes TF3 and saves this community from the deep dark pit that Blizzard has created here."
Vi,0,August 11,4,,0,Not Recommended,"Nearly everything in Overwatch 2 is a downgrade, from the switch to 5V5 making the game both more frustrating in solo queue and less interesting in a party alongside the erosion of tanking, to the progression being a paid feature retroactively making all of Overwatch 1's collecting gone and the removal of defining multiplayer-FPS maps of the 2010s like Hanamura & Volskaya.Its garbage content salvaged for Kotick & Activision-Blizzard to milk every last drop out of the dumpster that was Overwatch 2's development. Blizzard learned their lesson from WoW Classic when they cried because people would rather play the defining game from 2004 than settle for their watered down live version. The original game that was so critically acclaimed (An overstatement in retrospect imo) is now lost, and this is what remains. Without dedicated server support, Blizzard get the final say, and as long as people settle their greed will continue to infest and ruin their genuinely good IPs.OW1 won't be the last defining multiplayer title lost to time.The original game had a mountain of problems, but at least, at its core, it was a unique FPS that could be full of teamwork and counterplay. Overwatch 2 lacks any of the teamplay that set Overwatch apart, while being devoid of anything resembling good movement or gunplay that more individual-focused hero shooters, such as Apex, has.I had far more fun during Overwatch 1's 'maintenance mode' than I have during Overwatch 2, More content does not mean better, especially when its as half-baked as most of Overwatch 2's additions.Overwatch 2 is just another attempt from Blizzard to force fans to settle for mediocrity for the sake of their own greed.  A complete and total waste."

Neon Noodles,0,August 18,5,,10,Not Recommended,"The saddest thing about this game is knowing where it was to where its now come. This was an amazing team shooter that valued the player by allowing you to unlock cosmetics for your favorite champs through gameplay and dedication. That is no longer the case. Everything you want to buy costs 20$ a piece. New hero? 20 bucks. New skin? 20 bucks. Recolor of the skin you just bought? Another 20 bucks. When you add that Blizzard has also gone back on the promise for extended PvE content (the entire reasoning for upgrading this from Overwatch 1 to Overwatch ""2"") you can see they clearly did it to maliciously monetize the game. They basically said ""we've already made all the money we're going to make from selling this game at 60$, so let's make it ""free"" and monetize everything else."" Its a great game, but Activision-Blizzard is a terrible company and nobody should invest money into their properties.Edit: Even the SPRAYS cost 5$.

The whole point of Overwatch 2 was to make it so they could release a PVE part of the game, which is now not being released. There is no point to the existence of Overwatch 2. The skin prices are absolutely ridiculous, the game feels unbalanced and uninspired. Do not support Blizzard in any way. Play literally any other game. The overwhelmingly negative reviews are absolutely warranted. This company at the top is completely inept and are a stain on the gaming industry."

Gem,0,August 14,6,,0,Not Recommended,"There once existed two team shooters,  Both were a paid experience at launch. Later down the line these games became free with additional payed PVE content. One was barley updated for over half a decade, while one had a 2 slapped onto it's name. In the end one keeps getting updated while the other wishes for one final major update. But in a twist of fate, The one that was being updated has left consumers with a overwhelmingly negative response with poorly made micro transactions and repetitive game play. While the other with no updates to call its own still strives with a community persisting and enjoying its game play even after more than a decade on the market. These games represent a duality on how the game industry makes game and how in the last decade our landscape has shifted. making it more predatory, with free to play models, making money and content for cosmetics instead of making quality and worthwhile content changes. Although both had a similar start, Tf2 and Overwatch have made highly different outcomes.  Moral of the story? Make the game before calling it a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ product"
Symystery,0,August 10,5,,127,Recommended,"I have played Overwatch since May 2016 when Overwatch 1 released. I have around 5,000 hours in the game Overwatch at its core is a good game and always has been, even from the switch to OW2. However it’s terribly mismanaged by the company and they mistreat it’s fans often with false promises and terrible business practices.I love this game, I really truly do, but it’s so hard to recommend even as a fan of this game from the very start. I am only recommending it because at its heart the gameplay is fun, the company however is terrible.EDIT 8/15 Steam Deck Performance: Game works perfectly on the Steam Deck, however you need to use experimental proton at the minute. The developers have made optimizations specifically with the Steam Deck in mind. Going above 60 FPS on the deck is not supported, you can go lower to extend battery life if you wish. The default graphics are a mix of medium and high, which runs flawlessly on the deck with no dips at all. i didn't personally try, but you could probably push them a bit higher, I wouldn't recommend it though."

Intrepid Gaming,1,August 30,9,,0,Not Recommended,"Let me start off with this: I'm autistic. I'm a 24-year-old woman with heart failure. My lungs are half the size they should be.As a result, I can't physically do many of the things others my age can do. I developed heart failure due to complications from COVID-19 halfway through earning my nursing degree and now I'm not even sure if I'll be able to work as a registered nurse like I've always wanted to. So, I resort to playing video games with friends.The first team-based game I played was the original Overwatch in 2021. It quickly became my favorite game and worked its way into a part of my routine. It was a way to have some control in my life, and as an autistic person, this was appreciated. I worked my way up to Diamond rank in Competitive after only playing for a few months. My favorite hero to play above all others was D.Va because her lore kind of reminded me of my own ""lore."" Seeing all of the diverse heroes was so cool.And then Overwatch 2 came around. Just like my nursing career, my favorite game was ripped away from me. All of my friends stopped playing, even the one who showed me Overwatch. I can't blame them. The monetization is predatory, the ""balance"" changes are horrible, and what on earth did they do to mess up the matchmaking system so much?I don't even know why I still play it. I guess I'm clinging on to the nonexistent hope that the game will reach the level of glory it had before. I miss playing with my friends. I miss earning so many amazing skins simply by playing the game. I miss not being teamed up with players who have never played an FPS game in their life.The heroes? I love them. The developers? No, they aren't heroes. But the world could always use more heroes. They have time to change."

I don't hate the devs, they are doing their best, however the higher ups ruined this game. Overwatch has so much potential with its world behind it, some of the cinematics are the most enjoyable videos for me to watch, they are fantastic and expand on the characters I grew to love over time. However I fully understand why Jeff Kaplan left the overwatch team, he probably knew that his vision was not in the interest of the executives since their vision is filled by money and greed. OW2 to them was an excuse just to release battlepasses and overpriced skins, and unfortunately a fair portion of the community supported that. One of the most wasted potentials I have ever seen in the gaming industry.PvE is why I gave up after all this time. The PvE being replaced by missions similar to those found in events in OW1 instead of what we were going to get is largely disappointing, especially since you have to pay for those 3 bland missions. $23AUD, hell no.I played hundreds of hours of OW2 since its release, waiting and hoping for that hero-based upgrade filled, unique PvE only to be told months later that there was no plan to bring the PvE that was promised ever since OW2's release. I instantly unistalled and forgot about the game, never to touch it again. Yet here I am, because they had to make a desperate move to steam to try and get some players back. If it does bring numbers back and those numbers stay up,  keep going devs, good for you.All I know, is that I will not be one of those people. Thanks for the achievements, I appreciate them. I could sit here and rant about all the frustrating changes that has been made since OW1 released, and numbers have only exponentially grown since OW2. I probably put more effort into this review than blizzard ever has into Overwatch. Sad."

Cxlzu,0,August 19,24,10,0,Not Recommended,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead- murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was… astounded. I… I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess… I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."

That1BIGDude,1,August 13,6,,2,Not Recommended,"Have you ever loved something so much but you had to let it go because the relationship was so toxic that if you did not let go you would go down with them? That is the best way to describe my relationship with Overwatch and despite all its wrong doing I still love overwatch with every fiber of my soul. It hurt me quite a lot to give up on this but just like a toxic relationship I had to cut it off because all it was doing was hurting me.Everything started great when Overwatch first released I was confident that this would be it the next big thing the kind of multiplayer game that would make it to the big leagues like CSGO TF2 and Call of duty. I Loved Overwatch so much that I sunk 500 hours into the console version of the game Just to go and buy it again for PC and sink 1500 in game hours. I loved it so much that I continued to play this game religiously and Continued to buy Loot Boxes when its creators decided that the best thing to do with a freshly blooming game was to drop it and work on a PVE Sequel. This Game went from Number 1 to Lifesupport just because they had to redirect the manpower to make this amazing PVE MMO and Competitive Shooter Hybrid .  They said don't worry it will all be worth it when you finally this new PVE Story  mode we have created. This went on for several Years until finally  when I was just about to give up hope that my favorite game was dead, Came the announcement for Overwatch 2. Finally all our hopes and dreams will be solved. So Overwatch 2 came out and it was Overwatch 1 with less content one less player slot, A brand new monetization model and battle pass. There was no PVE content they said that they just needed some more time to cook and that they did not want to leave the game dead so they were going to start making more multiplayer content while the PVE was still cooking. They said don't worry its coming and this new Payment model is here because we need some extra funds to finish off the PVE. Disappointing  but I already waited this long whats a few more months.  so in those 10 months what did we get? 6 new heroes, 8 new maps and 5 maps removed. Each of those Hero's has been locked behind a $10 paywall. While you can unlock them through progression it can take up to the end of the season to even unlock them if you are  a casual player. Most of the time these hero's are extremely powerful when first released so you are at a disadvantage if you do not have them. Skins went from something you could work hard to unlock to starting at $20 a piece. The Battlepass does not pay for it self like every other game in existence it was not until a few months ago when they started including currency in the battle pass that you can use to purchase only old skins that existed before Overwatch 2 was a thing. The game does offer you ways to unlock premium currency but you have to literally play every single week for 3 whole season to be able to unlock one battle pass. This game does not respect you or your time whatsoever. You know who respects more of your time than Overwatch does? Bing you can use Bing for a few weeks and unlock the same amount of rewards that it would take you 4 months of playing Overwatch without pause.  For several months of its inception there was no way of earning any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at all. They also removed Several key QOL features from Overwatch 1 and spoon fed some of them back to us under the guise of new content. There was an extremely useful in game LFG where you could make groups and join strangers without having to matchmake you could do this to ensure you had a semi decent group of player to play comp or if you just wanted to chill with people that actually used their Mics. 10 months later and that feature is no where to be seen  There were dozens of these useful features that were removed for Overwatch 2.So at the end of the day this was all going to be worth it because they were going to release this super amazing fleshed out PVP game that they had to make a whole brand new engine for. I mean who cares about Overpaying for skins when it means that the actual good product that you have been waiting for several years for will be released. So where is the PVP that was promised? Never happening two months ago they told us that right before Overwatch 2 was given its final and official release Date they decided that it was no longer feasible and that they were going to scrap it. So before this ""Sequel"" ever came out they new that the PVP was not going to happen yet they promised it every step of the way saying that your money was going towards the funding of the PVE content and it was just a short release away. How did they tell us about this news btw? They made a long press release where 90% of it was talking about game mode designed to sell new skins and at the very end of it they said oh btw PVE is cancelled but do not worry we will still sell you the scraps. So the giant full blown PVE was not going to happen but they were still going to release some of the stuff that they already made. But they were going to charge everyone 14-$50 for non re-playable story missions that are barely 45 mins a piece. Every step of the way decisions have been made that have slowly killed this game off piece by piece and its absolutely guts me because I love this  game. I just can't support it because its only going to encourage these decision again. So I have to step away and watch my favorite game of all time slowly die So no I cannot recommend this game"

Oh let's not forget about the fact that you gotta pay for the new characters! I've got a total over 100 hours on Overwatch, it's always been a fun game but it keeps being updated into a complete disaster! I regret paying twice for this game. :)"
ValyriaN,0,August 11,14,,2,Not Recommended,"Do i recommend playing this game to play with friends? Yes. At a core this game might be the most fun FPS game there ever was. It has a hero cast that anyone can enjoy and the game does feel very good to play until you start to notice all the bads the game has that will make your hair grey within a span of a year. The first 3 years of the game was phenomenal, Best game ever phenomenal.. But after that they absolutely destroyed this game and yet i kept playing for 3 more years, Why? Because this game at it's core is still good.. I dropped this game because it was getting too frustrating in competitive mode and i don't really play this game casually in quickplay because i think that's the boring version of the game. There was nothing more fun than seeing self improvement and your rank reflect from that but as time went on they started changing stuff.. Now ever since Overwatch 2 the ranks are inflated, pretty much anyone can be masters/Grandmaster now if you put more than 2 hours a day into it. This was NOT the case before. There are an incredible amount of cheaters and that didn't really get any better once this game went free 2 play. So remember that 3 year drought we used to have just so they could focus on the PVE version of the game? Yea, Big fricking mistake Blizzard.. That was really enjoyable to play the game in the most horrible state it was ever been for 3 years just for you to cancel the whole PVE idea anyway and sell it in small bulks for a pretty ridiculous price. What has this game become? If you focused on PVP all those years the game would have been fine.. You know? Why your Overwatch fans started playing games! This game can still be turned around but they just refuse to do so. But hey Illari.. The new support is extremely fun to play ^^ But it's yet another dps disguised as a support you can't fool me, She pretty much replaced Cassidy at this point. I will say.. +1 point for the Steam release and i hope all Blizzard games come to steam because it's just the better platform."
musk911,0,August 11,20,,0,Not Recommended,"Overwatch 2? More like Overwatch 1.1. The only difference between 1 and 2 is Blizzard putting new heroes behind a paywall, the introduction of a battle pass and the complete removal of being able to get cosmetic items at a consistent rate for free. The reason it's called Overwatch 2 is because there was going to be a massive PvE mode added to the game. When Blizzard announced that this mode had been scrapped it became quite apparent to me that they do not care about Overwatch fans. All they care about is attempting to milk as much money as they can from this IP through overpriced cosmetics and making it so if you don't spend money you have a much worse experience. Want that new hero? Pay us to get it instantly or grind for a long time to finally get it. In a competitive team based shooter, when a team doesn't even have access to the entire roster because none of them spent money that feels very pay to win to me. It's been reported that someone would have to grind 7-8 months to get one legendary skin for free. Or they can spend $23 to get it instantly. Overwatch 2 is an abomination and it represents how hard Blizzard has fallen from the company everyone used to know and love. TF2 better"

Cypherous,0,August 10,30,,0,Not Recommended,"So, overwatch 2, born from the desire to add a proper PvE element to the game, however that would appear to not be the real reason for the 2.0 designation, it seems the real reason was just to add more ways to get people to pay for thingsThe reduction in team size to 5v5 and the complete role lock once you start a match do not make for a better game, freedom to swap roles in the middle of a match was greatBlizzards choice to gate access to new heroes behind battle pass progress was also extremely questionableBlizzard themselves have admitted that the game is no longer retaining players or bringing in the money they had hoped, this is why we even see this steam releaseAt its core the game can be fun, but the mismanagement by blizzard has ruined what was actually a fun game to play with friends and i have hundreds and hundreds of hours logged in it, but this, this does not spark joy :("

I quit in mid 2018 because the game was heading in a direction I didn't like, but it wasn't nearly as bad as Overwatch 2. Overwatch 1 meant a lot to many people who played it back in the day, and it's really sad to see blizzard running this amazing game. Blizzard's greed, ignorance, and false promises let to downfall of this amazing game. It pains me to say this and not recommend it to new players until Blizzard gets their priorities straight.

Gaz,0,August 14,5,,8,Not Recommended,"Ah, ""Overwatch 2,"" the long-awaited sequel that promised innovation but instead delivered a financial abyss and personal despair. It's like my mother-in-law in digital form: takes all my money, criticizes my decisions, and leaves my family in ruins.Let's start with the microtransactions. ""Overwatch 2"" basically reached into my pocket, took out my wallet, and started charging $20 for skins. You know, those shiny digital garments that don't keep you warm but do keep your self-esteem artificially inflated? Well, my wife looked at the credit card bill and said, ""It's me or the skins, choose wisely."" I chose... poorly.Gone are the days when you could earn skins through loot boxes. Now, they just straight-up charge you for them. If I wanted to spend $20 on something I don't need, I'd go to a fancy coffee shop and get a ""venti-mocha-something-pretentious.""And the game itself? My friends, if you take ""Overwatch"" and slap a ""2"" on it with the added bonus of bankrupting players, that's what you get. It's like they took the old game, gave it a new hat, and then charged me rent for looking at the hat.I tried to explain to my kid why Daddy was spending so much on virtual clothes. He just looked at me and said, ""I don't love you $20 worth, Dad."" It's a touching sentiment, really.So, if you're looking for a revolutionary gaming experience that will not only rob your bank account but also alienate your loved ones, ""Overwatch 2"" has you covered. Just don't be surprised when you find yourself explaining to your therapist why you value digital pants more than your family's affection.All in all, I'd like to thank ""Overwatch 2"" for teaching me a valuable lesson: never spend more on a digital skin than on your child's lunch. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to sell some furniture to afford my next game purchase. And maybe a new family.They promised us a riveting PvE story mode, and what did we get? Three missions for $15. That's right, FIFTEEN DOLLARS! I could've bought three gourmet sandwiches with that money, but instead, I have three digital adventures that were over quicker than my attempts at family bonding.These three missions are like a teaser for a movie that never comes out. My wife asked me why I'd spend $15 on something so short, and I told her it was an investment in our family's entertainment. She then reminded me of our actual investments, like our child's education. Whoops.And the story? I've seen more compelling narratives in my son's finger paintings. If I wanted a shallow plot with no real closure, I'd just read my high school diary.I mean, the graphics are still nice, and I guess the characters are cool, but it's like being given a beautiful cake made of cardboard. Sure, it looks great, but try explaining to your family why you're choking on paper instead of enjoying dessert.In conclusion, ""Overwatch 2"" is like that shiny new toy that looks appealing but breaks after three plays. My son stopped loving his broken toys, my wife stopped loving my financial decisions, and I stopped loving myself for spending money on this. If you're looking for a game that delivers the excitement of throwing money into a pit while slowly eroding your family's affection, this is the one for you!"
LG Kaz,0,August 14,6,,0,Not Recommended,"Oh boy, where do I even begin with Overwatch 2? I mean, have you ever felt like you were promised a gourmet pizza only to be handed a soggy piece of cardboard with some ketchup smeared on it? That's pretty much the Overwatch 2 experience in a nutshell – a game that's about as satisfying as biting into a pineapple-loaded monstrosity. And speaking of pizza, let me just take a moment to express my undying love for that cheesy, saucy delight. I'd rather have a lifetime supply of pizza delivered by a slow-moving sloth than play another minute of Overwatch 2.But let's not stray too far from the utter disappointment that is Overwatch 2. I mean, Blizzard, or should I say Blizz-NOT, has really outdone themselves this time. And by ""outdone,"" I mean they've managed to mess up a sequel so spectacularly that I'm starting to think it's some sort of performance art piece. Remember when we used to believe that Blizzard cared about their playerbase? Yeah, those were the good old days before they started treating us like guinea pigs in a sadistic lab experiment.Let's talk about how Blizzard treats their female employees, shall we? Oh wait, we're supposed to be talking about Overwatch 2, but hey, it's all related, right? Just like how pepperoni and mushrooms are related on a pizza – they might not go together, but they're both ingredients in the same mess. It's like Blizzard took a page out of the ""How to Alienate Everyone"" handbook and ran with it, disregarding the very people who make their games successful. But hey, at least they've got their priorities straight, like a pizza with an extra-thin crust and more cheese than you'd find at a dairy convention.Back to Overwatch 2 – I'd rather be stuck in a never-ending loop of ordering pineapple pizza and then immediately regretting it than subject myself to the lackluster gameplay and uninspired design choices this sequel offers. It's as if they thought, ""Hey, why make a game that's actually enjoyable when we can just repackage the same old stuff and slap a '2' on it?"" It's like ordering a pepperoni pizza and getting a pizza with nothing but crust. Yeah, that's what Overwatch 2 feels like – all crust, no substance.In conclusion, if I had to choose between playing Overwatch 2 and watching a documentary about the history of pizza dough, I'd be reaching for the popcorn and pizza-scented air freshener. Blizzard's ability to disappoint knows no bounds, much like my penchant for ordering extra cheese on my pizzas. So, if you're considering spending your hard-earned money on Overwatch 2, I'd recommend investing in a pizza franchise instead – at least then you'll have a chance of getting some real satisfaction. And who knows, maybe Blizzard can learn a thing or two from the art of crafting the perfect pizza, like how to deliver on their promises without leaving a bad taste in our mouths.But hey, at least Overwatch 2 has taught me one valuable life lesson: no matter how bad things get, at least we're not the poor souls responsible for greenlighting this disappointing excuse for a game. And that, my friends, is something to be truly thankful for."

Unknown,0,August 11,5,,0,Not Recommended,"I have played this game since the first overwatch 1 open beta. I had been hyped for this game since the first trailer. This game on launch was the best competitive FPS on the market for its time. Pushing the limits of what a team shooter was. Over the course of Overtwatch post release. I put thousands of hours of my time into the game. While originally playing the game for fun, i found myself improving to the point where I had begun participating with open division teams and getting to 4300+ SR on accounts before role queue came out as a hitscan player. I was there for every patch, meeting new people, pushing myself competitively in tournaments with people that at the time i could call my good friends while we spent easily 50+ hours a week playing and improving. watching our POVs, scrimming, and doing whatever was best to be the players. This was a game I was happy to grind at the time enjoyed as I wanted to eventually reach the point of GosuGamers and eventually Contenders/OWL once that was started. Even when i stopped as a player I still found myself doing coaching for players and even managing of a T3 team for a short period.However, this was years ago at this point. After months, the blizzard polish wore off the cracks and flaws of the game would show. While the Dev team has a lot going against them internally, they still failed to create changes to the game that benefit its players or to improve the game. On the contrary, the dev-team actively hurt the game. We went weeks and months with stale patches. Countless new heroes additions, maps, and balance changes that further created an unfun experience for everyone in the game. A majority of the release heroes were fine, even in some niche cases like mei, she still had obvious ways to play against that felt fair. Ana was the only post release hero that felt like an overall good thing for the game. Her sleep, while one of the strongest CC tools we have seen, was balanced around being a 'hard' to aim projectile that could be interupted by anyone accidently waking up a target. It was fair. Other heroes, Sombra, Moira, Orisa, Doomfist, etc. While cool and interesting and had their issues. Which in any game could have been fine, the devs would have done or tweaked these new heroes eventually. This was sadly not the reality for overwatch. Heroes like Brigitte and Sigma were troublesome heroes for MONTHS. Just those two heroes alone tranisitioned METAs into GOATs and doubleshield. Meta shifts are fine, but these were MONTHS if not years of problematic issues that the balance team could never solve. This problem of being unable to create a positive change lead the dev team to attempt multiple rash decisions due to their inability to properly change the game. GOATs became an issue due to the strength of Brigitte's utility and the value that tanks could have over picking DPS. Instead of making radical changes to try and change up the meta, they threw in the towel and introduced 2/2/2-rolequeue. Now, this obviously fixed the issue of GOATs, but it felt like a band-aid fix. Sure, GOATs was definitely strong but i never felt that attempted any major changes to target the team composition due to fear of targeting players to make them feel weak. (Personally i loved GOATs btw, it was one of the most technical metas we had and individually each player held so much strength to improve from GM-top500 mechanically in this meta. the main people that hated GOATs was ironically the flex-dps players that were stuck on brig.)Then it was sigma with double shield right after. The near impenetrable shields of Sigma/Orisa would wreak havoc. The fast paced way of playing GOATs was replaced by a shooting shield sim. Sadly, the dev team again showed they were unable to make any significant change to the meta. This is what lead overwatch 2 to be a 5v5 game instead. Losing the possibility of Reinhardt/Zarya comps is one of the saddest decisions to happen to this game. Every major change that effected gameplay has only further limited the game.Not to mention Blizzards fear of reworking or touching problematic heroes for months. It took MONTHs to convince the devs during launch that hey, maybe having a mass-revive on a support hero. Leading to camping inside the spawn room to wait for ults on 2cp maybe wasnt the best choice. But this was all overwatch 1, the dev team worked to improve overwatch 2 right? They had put ow1 on life support, leaving players with a huff of copium every few months to keep our spirits up. So what came to ow2 after leaving the existing players left to rot?While heroes were reworked, to remove CC and PVE to look out for, Everyone was hyped for OW2. Even at the time it made no sense to re-release the game outside of money reasons but that was put to the aside, excited for what was to come. and what came?- We lost 6v6 for 5v5 due to failure of the dev team to balance. We lost the possibility of many compositions and interactions because the team couldn't figure out balance. Reinhardt/zarya - Winston/D.VA - Orisa/Sigma. All iconic tank compositions just gone from ever existing again- We lost many features from OW1 - on fire, previous season data, loot boxes. some of this is still being RE-added into OW2.- we LOST the PVE originally promised, shown and that was playable. For 4 years, the dev team worked on something that never existed, and even though they knew they were no longer providing on their original promises. The dev team kept it behind doors that PVE was trashed in what was promised for the watered down PVE experience that we had already played X amount of times. the Replay-ability heavily reduced, and player freedom was gone.- After Blizzard killed HOTS pro circuit around the rise of OWL, they just killed it recently as well, with a mass-layoff of people I had known or interacted with previously.- We lost 2cp for a gamemode thats just as frustrating. Teams were punished for winning the first fight due to counter picking on 2nd fight. Losing the possibility to gain momentum due to losing ults % or forced into playing in an unfavorable comp.- Skins that were in the game since release were re-slapped with a price tag. the only fully functional thing in overwatch 2 was the battlepass and shop. The battlepass would also lock new heroes behind a slow grind for free players.The steam release is not a decision to get more players but only for the money so that execs that see theyre in the green in their quarterly calls. Blizzard is no longer the company that has the players best interest at heart, only its shareholders. I feel bad for the Devs that put blood sweat and tears into their games just for them to be shells and forgotten relics of the time where they used to be and I hope they are able to transition to other companies successfully. I hope that OW and other blizzard IPs can make a turnaround eventually. But in the current state, i do not recommend OW2. There are better alternatives at this time for both casual and hardcore competitive players."

H30000,0,August 10,7,,7,Not Recommended,"TL:DR: Don't try this game, just don't. Stay as far way from it as possible, it is for your own well being. Now, where do I even begin? Overwatch (2) is one of those games where every 5th review is a person with 6000 hours saying: ""I hate this game, and it makes me hate evreyone. 10/10"" and that is very true. There is nothing like overwatch, but it is still awful in so many regards. Overwatch(2)' gameplay is something truly special, and while many will disagree: you cannot replicate a game like this, blizzard has caught lightning in a bottle. No matter how many losing streaks filled with horrible matches you have, you will be coming back for more. The joy this game brings is inexplainable.  However...  Blizzard's handling of what was once a game of the year winner has left it being a shell of its fromer self.To begin with the elephant in the room: Overwatch 2 is not a sequel, especially not anymore. Overwatch 2 was supposed to be blizzard's big splash into PvE for this franchise. Overwatch 1 was left with basically no new content after the release of 'Echo' in 2020 with the promise of PvE. Overwatch 2 releases early in October of last year with all the map and hero content the last years were missing, and no PvE. What it did have though, you guessed it a cash shop. Blizzard took away overwatch 1's progression system which allowed for the acquisition of almost all cosmetics for free, given enough time, with the launch of overwatch 2. In its place the game got a battle pass and $20 skins. One skin, for one character (of which there are more than 20)  for 20 dollars USD . In May of this year blizzard announced that PvE (as they advertised it) would no longer ship due to it being too big a undertaking (translation = it wouldn't generate enough money for the company). The game got no major content for two years under the promise of a big release with the sequel, just for the ""sequel"" to strip players of all free progression and then cancelling the promised PvE anyways. Overwatch (2) removed  more features than it added and some are still being added back by blizzard. Lol. Don't get me started on the disaster that is blizzard's handling of the esports scene.On to the actual playing experience: Awful. Blizzard constantly adds power creep with every new character they release (which is initially locked behind the battle pass by the way). They heavily favour certain characters, while others have been bottom tier for several years. The game has no sense of direction when it comes to balance, and blizzard does not know what to do with certain heroes. This would be fine if blizzard didn't take  several months  to release new patches to fix the mess they created. Characters like Lifeweaver and Sym will probably never see the meta. While charcters like Mercy, Kiriko, Ana and Sombra (just to name a few) will always be proplematic due to the extreme difficulty of balancing around certain parts of their kit. Word of advice: never ask a doomfist main how they feel about the character, or how many bugs he has (some from release).Other than that: Matchmaking is horrible even in the highest ranks simply due to the nature of how the game is structured with it's heroes. And solo queue is an absolute slog in the most casual of modes. This game will leave you fuming at the sheer lack of awareness many people exhibit. In casual modes you will be at a minor to severe disadvantage 50% of the time when queuing into a game, because players who get defence are at such a big advantage.Oh and screw push, the chane of that horrible game-mode appearing single handedly keeps me from doing ""one more game"". Can it be fun? Absolutely, especially with friends. Is there anything else like it on the market? Absolutely, not. Is what blizzard has done, and is doing to this game not at all the way to go? Should you honestly pick this up as a first time player? No. Will I still play this and have fun even if not for long periods like pre-OW2? Yes, probably."

Latte,0,August 17,5,,21,Not Recommended,"The game itself is great, well polished, the gamemodes are decent, the heroes are fun, the music is nice the visuals and animations are stellar, there's obviously a lot of care put into the game on a development and optimisation level... It's just that the executive lies and deceiving from the games past is impossible to overlook and Blizzard has completely sabotaged everything likeable about the experience from an ethical standpoint. I do love the game for what it is, a very well made ability-based team-shooter, however I think that the community is rightfully upset about how their expectations have been set so high and then been let down by false promises, corporate greed, and lack of communication up to now. I also genuinely hope that things change in the future, and I have seen the recent strides taken from the developers to do so. I genuinely love playing Overwatch and have done so since the beginning of Overwatch 1 so it's slightly painful to not recommend the game for me, that being said: until the management of the game is overturned or sees significant changes I doubt the review bombing will ever really let up."

Gillder,0,August 11,3,,19,Not Recommended,"I've been Playing Overwatch for Years now, and despite their flaws, it was a fun game that's I would play quite frequently. Overwatch ""2"" feels like a chore with bare minimum rewards, unkept promises, way too overpriced skins, and strange match making that just drags this game down. It's honestly a real shame. Maybe it'll be fun again one day, but from the looks of it, this is going to stay a quick live service cash grab.Slight edit for clarity. I in no way blame the devs for this. they are clearly working their butts off to give a good experience. and honestly, season 6 is the best season they've released so far.

However, Blizzard (or rather, Bobby Kotick) robbed me of my purchase, and replaced it with this ""Free-to-play"" garbage.  It's more aptly labeled ""Pay-to-Win"".  The depths to which I despise their assassination of my favorite game cannot be put into words.I miss this game so much..."
Desperado,0,August 12,33,2,0,Not Recommended,"It uses auto mutes and auto banns.Which means if enough players report you you be muted or banned automatically.It all comes down to how many reports you have, not about if the report was legit or not.Counting up from 24 hours and every time you get muted or banned it doubles by 2.Again, even if you got banned or muted for nothing and they overthrow it.You still be banned for 48 96 192 etc hours every time you reach a report threshold.Blizzard doesn't care about you, make sure you note this one down.Even if you got banned or muted for no reason, prob they won't overthrow it anyway.So if you don't play the meta roles, don't be suprised you getting muted and or banned out of nowhere."
Lexarate,0,August 27,6,,1,Not Recommended,"Not the game i remember playing, they murdered the game we all once loved and put this cashgrab instead.Where is the PvE mode promised, oh yeah it got cancelled, so basically this is worse that Overwatch 1 with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ battle pass system, heroes hid behind paywall or grind, skins are only available for those who has deep pockets. Man come on, 20 bucks for a recolored skin? Stop with the greed and give your community what they want. Oh right, you have one passionate about game anymore.Also Aaron Keller, if you want this ""review bombing"" to stop - I am only writing a review to share my opinion - you could have delivered your promises, keeping the original ""all heroes are free"" design and keeping level system with loot box ( I got it, it is gambling for some and you had problems with some countries and their laws, simply remove purchase option for loot boxes and add battlepass as well) this way you could make money with battle pass and people who won't spend a dime on this game still could get cool skins and stuff.I also missed Hanamura and Volskaya as well, you could just remove it from ranked rotation and keep them in quick play map pool.Pros:- Free to Play- ???Cons:- Heroes behind pay wall- 20 dollars for skins- Push Mode- No 6v6- Battle Pass- Paid PvE content (15 bucks for 2 hours worth of content)- Releasing too many heroes which will cause an unbalanceable game- No access to the game I paid for (Overwatch 1)"
Assass1n1191,0,August 14,12,,0,Not Recommended,"I have over 800 hours in Battle.Net.Since I first played Overwatch 1 I loved this game. Game's universe, characters, mechanics, map design - I loved it. We played with friend since 2018 and had tons of fun. Even when game stopped to receive updates we continued playing, because we genuinly loved it.When Overwatch 2 was announced I was SO excited, i couldn't wait for beta to start. Then beta was released. It was buggy, raw and with lack of content, but ok, I waited for full release with hopes that it will get better. And then on October 4 Owerwatch 2 was released. Same lack of content, more than a half mechanics removed compared to OW1, added skins for 20$, insane amount of grind required to get a legendary skin (a few months for a single skin), battle pass which gives 0 excitement to complete it, but still I played it for the first 4 seasons.But then I left, I can't stand it anymore. Matchmaking is SO bad, low rank players playing with high rank, also new events are pointless and no excitement to play them at all. But you know what is the worst? The attitude for players. They cancelled PvE, they put insane prices and grind limits just for one reason - money.I don't like when game developers theat players like that and I wish nobody to be treated like that. So my review is a warning to don't start playing this game, developers don't care about anything but money, they don't deserve that loyal playerbase they had.I wish for Overwatch 2 online to be 0 - that what Blizzard deserve. They need to understand that their desicions have consequences."

Given the increasingly predatory nature of Overwatch, Diablo, World of Warcraft and HearthStone, it was not simply the right thing to do—it was the only thing to do. Supporting Activision Blizzard in any way contradicts basic human morality. Even worse, experiencing something positive in those games is becoming close to impossible.

KiKO,0,August 12,3,,5,Not Recommended,"Not a day one player, nor closed beta but I've been playing it actively since the first anniversary event (2017) until late 2020 where I switched to Apex Legends. Honestly? Best switch I've made, game feels more rewarding to me and more fun despite its flaws. I have around 1k hours on OW. Apex nearing 3k now. My Overwatch backgroundThis is the game that introduced me to online FPS world and made me hooked on the genre. There are so many heroes and mechanics catered to everyone's level of entry, experience, and prefered role. My first main or character I picked up being D.Va because Neon Genesis Evangelion. I stayed mostly on the (off) tank role since then, too. I survived the GOATS meta (tbf I didn't bother with ranked there) and the content drought. I came back for new events and weekly arcade lootboxes just to close the game again. That interest eventually died too after the Halloween event. I became so burnt out on the game and its technically non-existent balancing. Rank-wise I played it rather casually around Platinum level.Overwatch ""2"" (or 1.1)Now, OW2 was on the horizon. They released it early, keeping us warm on the promised PvE (THE WHOLE JUSTIFICATION OF CALLING IT A SEQUEL AND PUTTING A ""2"" BEHIND THE NAME). I tried it out, it was ok! I had fun playing it casually with friends and adjusting to the 5v5 mechanics and gameplay. It did feel better than the double shield stuff. S1, I purchased and finished the BP in the end. Didn't get much out of competitive (though the system of grinding and displaying ranks was really annoying at the time). It was alright but it also didn't hook me back as it did. Apex had me by my balls witih a firm grip.S2, Ramattra comes out. Darn, it's my first locked hero and it's a tank. Caved in and purchased the BP again because of the very slow XP progression at the time. Didn't regret it because I love this character but I haven't had the time to finish the BP so it felt like 10 bucks down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ overall. Didn't bother with the game S3-S5. Lifeweaver was lackluster, I tried him out. He felt very underwhelming to say the least. The game itself wasn't rewarding for me to play.Then they dropped the bomb during the Starwatch stream or whatsoever. Basically 45 minutes of filler content about the current event I didn't bother with, just to then drop the bomb. They are cancelling the PvE (and they knew it way before but didn't know when to drop the bomb). Or at least cancel it how they wanted to sell it to us at BlizzCon 2019 with a watered down version of it. So basically they're bringing Archives events (that used to be released for free in OW1) and want us to pay 15 bucks if we wanna play it?? Honestly this is so shameless. The whole monetization of this game has been a disaster. OW2 is just a huge shop update with predatory microtransactions. I can't even comprehend how you can release something so bad that people prefered the old lootboxes system over whatever this is. A cashgrab. And it seems to work. Who tf buys that?The skins are bangers, no doubt. Blizzard's art team is carrying this dead horse of a game so hard. I don't think they're reasonably priced though. Same with the story missions. I'd rather put those 15 bucks elsewhere and just watch the cutscenes on YouTube which I did.And it all makes me so mad because I really enjoy the lore and world-building. The Genesis triology slapped and it got me so mad, thinking of this game's wasted potential over the years. The new hero (Illari) looks fun and strong though. tl;dr I'd rather pay full price 60-80 USD for the promised PvE and come back to the PvP casually than whatever the hell they made out of this game. Playing Blizzard games is like being in an abusive relationship at this point. Promises to change but never does and becomes something worse that you could ever imagine. Yet you still wanna give her another chance because of that first spark that hooked you."

Froggy B,0,August 23,10,,10,Not Recommended,"To quote Aurelio Voltaire in The Necropolis of Former Lovers:  ""You finally made me mad enough to write that song about you.""Consider this review a swan song. Initially I wasn't going to join in on the negative review train, but then Aaron Keller had to open his mouth and act like the foolish corporate puppet he is.Hey, Aaron? If getting review-bombed is not a good experience, maybe consider that your game is not a good experience to play.TL;DR version: Overwatch 2 is not a game worth your time or money. Overwatch 2 is a testament to executive abuse, out of touch developers, corporate greed, and a playerbase that is held in a Stockholm Syndrome-esque addictive bondage. Do not play it, do NOT spend money on it. The only thing Actiblizz understands is money, and until that money stops flowing, they do not care about the sheer volume of negative press they get.Let me get these facts stated first, for the shills who will scream ""REVIEW BOMBER:""-I admit to inflating my Steam playtime by letting the game idle, to make it harder to filter out. HOWEVER, I had over 1400 previous hours through the Blizz client, from January 2018 - February 2023, so I think I am allowed a little ""fibbing"" to ensure my voice is heard.-I am not a ""disgruntled"" TF2 or Paladins player. If I'm going to point you to any multiplayer game, it's Don't Starve Together.-I officially quit in February 2023, shortly before the Valentine's Day/Cupid Hanzo event, and kept up with the major events through news/social outlets. I did in fact play through the ""maintenance mode"" years of OW1 as well as the first two seasons of OW2 as well as part of Season 3, until my disgust became insurmountable. So I am not one of those ""hasn't played the game since 2018"" people.With that out of the way, let's talk about why this game *is* so bad as to warrant over 100,000 negative reviews, shall we?The deletion of the original game.When Overwatch 2 was first announced (back when Jeff Kaplan was still the lead director), it was said that Overwatch 1 would still exist in a sort of ""stasis state."" Players could still play the game they paid for, and would receive PvP updates (maps, characters, etc.), but the ""full experience"" which was the PvE material and all things related would have to be paid for. Instead, the devs removed OW1 outright and forced OW2 down everyone's throats.The monetization.This is the biggest and most justified complaint that most people have. OW1 was a ""buy to play"" game with cosmetics-only lootboxes, which could also be bought *or* earned for free through gameplay. While lootboxes have their own problems, the fact that they and almost all save a scant few cosmetics could be earned for free alleviated the gambling issue by a large margin. (This is something you cannot even say about TF2, which requires you to buy keys and the like in order to unlock their loot crates.) All other content was free as well - heroes, maps, and even event modes like Archives were available to all players without having to shell out a single extra penny.This was then replaced by one of the WORST F2P, FOMO-laden models I have ever seen. The bias towards whales vs. non-paying players. Battlepasses that need to be paid for, heroes that are locked behind said battlepasses making the game a pay-to-win/P2W scenario, cosmetics being timegated (before you could get them again when an event rolled back around the next year, and usually cheaper too), various event missions (such as the watered-down PvE) are also locked behind a paywall. Completing the battlepass doesn't even give you enough currency to buy the next one, something even FORTNITE, the originator of most terrible F2P cosmetic practices, does for you.The feature downgrade.Where do I even begin. First of all is the PvE, which was the whole reason that Overwatch 2's existence was justified in the first place. PvE was scrapped entirely, worse was that they *knew* they had scrapped it and intended to focus on their ""live service""/""battlepass"" model for well over a year before announcing it, so as to keep milking money from players who were holding out in the interim. What was left of the PvE was basically stripped for parts then served back to the playerbase for even more money. Then there was the removal of a tank, removal of most social features like Looking For Group, end of match cards, the on-fire system, the removal of several characters' core movesets as they got reworked yet AGAIN for the worse (I wasn't even a Doomfist main, but man he was done dirty), the removal and now somehow RETURN BUT WORSE version of the leveling system, the deterioration of the matchmaking quality - prioritizing quick queues over quality and causing the likes of Bronze and Grandmaster players to be dumped in the same matches as each other. Even the graphics are a downgrade, the entire lighting system is completely scuffed, the skins are lackluster and clearly outsourced, and the map redesigns have some cover lazily slapped on without any actual effort put into fixing them for new formats. They even brought back MAP POOLS despite them trying that in OW1 and it being widely hated!The story and characters.This one is a personal gripe, I'll admit, since the only people who cared about the lore of Overwatch were me, my friend, and one insufferable guy on Reddit (Doc, you know who you are). Say what you will about the quality of Overwatch's story, at least it and the characters were consistent. Now? We've thrown out all the original plot hooks for ""Omnic Crisis 2.0."" Which REALLY does not look good considering that the main villain spearheading it is from an oppressed class. It wasn't good when David Cage did the robot uprising as a metaphor for racial tension in Detroit Become Human, it's not good when Actiblizz does it either. We've gone against established worldbuilding for the sake of aesthetics - Michael Chu was not the best writer, but at least Chu was consistent. Magic was NOT a thing in Overwatch, not even for the Shimada dragons, which was some form of technology not yet explained/explored. But oh, we bring in the manic snarker magic fox girl Kiriko because we want the h0rny weeb money. There's also the extreme flanderization or utter non-development of characters. Sojourn is STILL boring, Soldier 76 has turned into a walking boomer joke, Pharah finally got a personality and it's ""bootlicker jock"", while they turned my sweet babygirl Orisa into a violent juggernaut. These are not the characters I loved, these are not the characters I read in their original stories and comics. These are caricatures, made to appeal to kiddies who wanna buy skins and look cool.The diversity as a smokescreen.I could literally track Actiblizz controversies with their announcements of ""diversity"" events and characters, as well as the fact that it's little more than lip service considering that they make content censorable so that they can still profit off bigoted foreign markets (such as Tracer's girlfriend reveal). Example: Pharah and Baptiste revealed as LGBT characters? Right before the PvE cancellation is announced. The Hong Kong incident. The sexual harassment scandal that led to McCree's renaming. The fact that it TOOK SO MANY YEARS for there to even BE a Pride Month event. The many female players that are chronically harassed while Blizz shills a pro-female stream event. It's all disingenuous.The original Overwatch got the praise it did for a reason. It had great potential and it was run by devs who clearly actually cared and were passionate about what they were doing outside of profit. The game still had problems, sure, but it was fun to play despite those problems, the playerbase loved it, and at most the game needed a little upkeep or management to iron its problems out.Instead, that original team quit and we got Overwatch 2, the hollow parasite puppeting around its predecessor's corpse."

MayaMomo,0,August 13,5,,0,Not Recommended,"Alright, I wasn't going to do this originally, but decided why not. As you can see from my achievements, I played this game a lot. I turned it on through steam basically solely to give my review for Overwatch 2, I'd personally prefer to review Overwatch 1 as that's the game I played since 2016, but they killed it and replaced it with a shell of what it once was, so I guess I'll be reviewing Overwatch 2 and giving a sort of post-mortem review of Overwatch 1. Where to begin...I like many, many others, played Overwatch on release day in 2016. I absolutely loved it. Became a D.VA main for a good few years and enjoyed almost all of my time in the game. I paid 40 euro for the game, and can say I never once paid for a lootbox cosmetic. Why is that? Well, back in the day, before this hellscape of battlepasses, drip fed content and 30$ skins, we had lootboxes. They weren't great, in fact they sucked. I wrote a thesis in 2019 about lootboxes and how they correlate with the rise of problem gamblers in people aged 18-30 in the late 2010s, so I know a bit about this system and can safely say its not great. You know ActivisionBlizzard royally ♥♥♥♥♥ up when they make people wish the had lootboxes back....For all the faults of lootboxes of which there are many, you could still earn quite a lot of them in Overwatch 1 simply by playing the game, without spending a penny and certainly not no-lifeing the game I managed to get almost every cosmetic for most characters. Overwatch 2 is basically an excuse to revamp the cash shop, in the wake of government intervention against gambling mechanics in videogames, ActivBlizz decided it wise to move away from that model and replace it with arguably a much worse one, one where you get 0 rewards for just playing the game besides a crumb of coins a week which would take a player 6 months give or take to earn a skin for free if they did every single weekly objective. A system where you must make this game your life in order to do the battlepass and ensure ActivBlizz has all of your time on this earth as player retention, a system that rewards, no FORCES the player to either play an ungodly amount of time for a skin or just pony up 30$....but only right now! for if you blink, the skin is gone from the shop! possibly never to return!.....When you think about it, a time limited shop of wares like this is almost like a lootbox they open in front of you, and fomo you to buy the contents of before its too late, you never know what tomorrows cash shop will look like.....'please log in' cries bobby kotick.Gameplay wise? The balancing is ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Not that Overwatch 1 had amazing balancing, but most character during the Kaplan era of this game were designed to be around eachother, to work off one another and to be synergistic picks together. This is still mostly true in Overwatch 2, but with the horrid idea that now, the new characters are paywalled into the battlepass! What does that mean for balancing? Well, if you know anything about ActivBlizz, they LOVE to release broken ass characters like Bridgette post launch, and I can say with utmost certainty without even playing that locking new characters in a battlepass gives a very unfair advantage to a team that can pick said new characters over a team that can not. PVE. Like most I too was excited for PVE content, unlike most though, I wasn't suprised to hear it was cancelled. When the scandals of ActivBlizz and how they treat employees broke out in 2021, I all but abandoned my BattleNet account. I couldn't justify supporting this company with my time, and it hurt because Overwatch was very dear to me, OVerwatch 1 still is dear to me, in memory atleast. But those days are over. The ActivisionBlizzard of the past is dead, its a corpse pretending to be something it used to be, the staff mistreated and having left the company (We miss you Jeff) and Overwatch 1 remians to right now, unplayable. I'm sure like WOW they will nostalgia bait many by releasing an ""Overwatch Classic"" to try cover up the absolute dumpster fire that has been Overwatch 2, but as it stands, I do not suggest supporting this company with your time, and certainly not your money. One last thing, I've seen a lot of people accusing TF2 fans of 'Reviewbombing' this game. This couldn't be further from the truth, in actuality this is the first time disgruntled players of a franchise they love dearly feel they finally have a platform to share their upset and annoyance at a company who have all but abandoned their talent, developers and morals to greed. But it certainly doesn't help that TF"" (which I do recommend playing) is seeing a renaissance revival which Overwatch dies pitifully. It's ironic. I quit TF2 and moved to overwatch all those years ago, only to now write this about how badly mismanaged ActivisionBlizzard have been for the IP and for the last year or so, I've been back on TF2 and enjoying myself.....weird how times chance us all, but in words written by those godly writers long ago, ""No king rules forever"", and that certainly rings true for the husk of a company that runs Overwatch."

Blizzard had tons of examples how to do it better, they even had done it better before taking the first offline. Promised content wont be released and for small parts of the campaign meant to be given out for free you can now pay. Oh and heroes that when first released are almost needed in a team either require many hours or (again) money.A sequel releasing completly removing the first part (so you cant play it no more), also removing several features as well as content and not even running at all when first released is just amazing. No one should spend money on a company like this when all they do is charge you and constantly not deliver either promised or needed content. Even without all that they have no clue how to balance characters but hey at least with the steam release you can now tell them how you think about this game."
Moon.mp4,0,August 10,24,,1,Not Recommended,"the game is already dead and ruined by its own creatrors due to the fake promises the dev`s has told about th `PVE` release. - changing a character name from `mccree` to `cassidy because the name mccree represente a dev`s member who sexually harass his co-workers so the best the could do is change the character name in the game.- the ranked match making , makes no sense even when you`re at master promo you`ll still be having new to the game team mates who`s from `bronze v` to `silver 1` which is so unbalanced.- monetization the in game items and making it overpriced , which overwatch 1 has loot boxes that can be earned through playing the game and durring events.- releasing a story mode missions to get to know to the characters lore more and more but its 15$ its an obvious scam.- removing talent`s tree.- unbalanced character`s.as an OG overwatch players from 2018 to the release of its downfall , i think `Jeff Kaplan` a ex overwatch director did the right thing by quiting this failure project.  and i`d like to add :- also the new addition `illari` its just `senna` from the game `League of Legends` having the same role, the same weapon design, nearly the same hair cut, and nearly the same abilities, and the same skin color- and lifeweaver is just albedo from genshin"

There is nothing to freely unlock properly anymore, you have to pay for 95% of content - even the dumped down coop missions cost money that they just released in a rush. 15 bucks for a couple missions btw. Just buy Left 4 Dead and have 1000x more fun that playing this greed-infested garbage game.

																Oh you want a REAL review? Okay...♥ Everything is a baffling laser light show. I could end the review right here. The first game was this and nothing has changed.♦ The game still boils down to ""flick your willy until everyone has ult charged, then spam on the point all at once."" Casual and competitive players will find it shallow.♣ Nothing is well-balanced. They had to outright remove a character (Bastion) for 1 year because they couldn't balance him... when he was playable on release and throughout OW1. Roadhog was murdered in cold blood by balance patches.♠ It's a stripped down Overwatch 1 designed to yank as much money out of paypiggy nipples as possible. ""If they're dumb enough to buy the hype once, they'll do it again!"" is the motto. They ripped a page out of the World of Warcraft expansion playbook.♥ Battlepass garbage (see above). It would take thousands of dollars to afford everything in this game. That includes playable heroes. Imagine a game's meta being defined by a character you have to shell out tons of cash to even access.♦ The only feedback Blizzard has ever taken to heart regarding this game is the campaign lamenting a lack of black female characters... and even that was probably something they astroturfed in-house (like the Blender porn they were caught commissioning.) ♣ Jeff Kaplan AKA Tigole is a massive jew hack fraud. He's gone now but nothing he ruined was ever fixed (such as Roadhog.)♠ The PVE game mode that was allegedly the entire reason Overwatch 1 had to be re-developed was cancelled, then resurrected, then revealed to be a hastily-made hackjob to try and salvage PR. I played this game for 300+ hours. I hit the highest competitive rank, then refused to play anymore when Blizzard demanded my phone number... which they still do.This game is a mess. Blizzard is a mess. If you have any hope for this game even with the Microsoft acquisition then you have rocks in your head, just look at what they did to Halo.Go play Warcraft 3, Starcraft 1 (and I guess 2) and Diablo 2. Pretend Blizzard died after."
Chief Miles O'brien,1,August 14,16,,0,Not Recommended,"Good skins, terrible repetitive game. Not befitting of a Starfleet Officer. (read in Miles o'briens voice) Overwatch used to be my favourite, for more than 4 years I played and enjoyed it, enduring every patch note, every nerf and subsequent megabuff. Overwatch 2 is unfortunately much not that game anymore. The fantasy of having a powerful character that is one of the strongest people in the world whether it be from a gigantic rocket-powered cybernetic fist implant that can canonically level buildings - to a hardlight artificer with orbiting satellites that can divide a city in half - you are always a weakling. I have been blessed to be a Junkrat main so I haven't been hit too hard by any patch notes for years besides not being able to level a whole team with my nuke tire, but the whole POINT of overwatch is to be a badass fighting amongst and against badasses. When I play any other character I feel weak and unable to really affect the course of the game, help my teammates, or carry. Yes I still get the little dopamine rush from an elim or saving a teammate, but after 4 years why would I choose to care about this game vs other games that will give me 10000 hours of gameplay and replayability, and RESPECT me as a consumer in this disrespectful, manipulative and abusive society.?To lob my 10000th grenade? To watch an inting rein charge in and die for the millionth time on a map that hasn't recieved an update in 3 years? The term bait and switch has been seemingly deemed ""overused"" by the defenders of Blizzard, but it is an apt description for what this greedy, scummy company has done to long term players and new players alike. They promised us all story missions, skill trees, rewards, they promised us vast character development and story arcs that expand their universe to new lengths.They now are charging me $20 for a subpar, trash, *one hour long story mission* as a cash grab to keep their failing game that they MADE fail afloat. That is a veritable SLAP in the face. If you didn't know they lied - then don't burden the angered masses and force them to educate you for what you should already know.Diablo 4 is an excellent reaffirming argument against Blizzard. Again with the bait and switch, they needed to get their game out ahead of other mega blockbusters that were coming out that we were all waiting for so they released without a starting season OR shop which I found hilarious. Do you know WHY?Because we were the guinea pig investors! We said okay this game is subpar and repetitive but it is still in prerelease! So to play it millions of players preordered and were greeted with, again, server issues and queues. With no offline mode...From a company that has millions to throw into servers, the game was DDOSed and even befire that had issues. For gods sake its unplayable on my Lady's High end PC becuase they were so stupid in coding it that you load EVERY PLAYER ON THE WORLDS INVENTORY CONSTANTLY. With every new player that loads and leaves the server you have a stutter. -Blizzard is going downhill and it's all thanks to egomaniac Bobby Kotick. -Illari is a direct rip off of Senna. -Go buy Baldur's gate 3 - For less than the price of the DLC for OW2:You will be contributing to the betterment of gaming as a whole. Thousand hours of story, dialogue and character choices and customization options and get this - every item you can have... is ALREADY IN THE GAME!"

Kaernak,0,August 13,5,,5,Not Recommended,"Basically, the entire justification for the sequel's existence (giant pve campaign with skill trees and such), will not be coming.

Which, I'm not really sure why anyone WOULD like these changes. Skins and such now cost a nauseating amount of money and of course it needs to have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ battle pass like every single online game has nowadays, just to add yet another game to the extremely long list of games that don't value your time or money. That original $40 I spent on the first game is completely lost to the void with nothing to show for it. Actually, overwatch 2 treats me like a new player now where it says I have to win 30 matches to unlock previously released new heroes, even though I literally have the ""win 100 quickplay matches"" achievement?

The gameplay experience, unfortunately, can evoke an array of less-than-optimistic emotions. It's as though a storm of frustration brews within you, and saying gamer words multiple times per second is just a reality casting a shadow over your interactions with fellow players, be they, teammates or adversaries. The delicate balance of heroes and abilities that truly doesn't exist. Speaks volumes about how much you can be bad in your job as a game developer. This game is only alive for two reasons faecal matter of players that are so connected by nostalgia for gud'ol days and porn addicts.

D R O I D,0,August 11,19,2,0,Not Recommended,"Overwatch 2, once a beloved haven, now wears a false smile as it rifles through your pockets, its once-authentic essence obscured by a veil of avarice.Back in 2016, I embraced its world and got entangled like countless others. Overwatch stood tall as my cherished shooter for ages, even during the parched times leading to the dawn of OW2.Amid its endearing visage, enchanting characters, and peerless multiplayer landscapes, OW2 orchestrated colossal downgrades, cracking its very foundation. Let me illustrate:#1 - Heroes Locked in the Dance of CoinThe greatest shift, a blow that hammered shut the coffin lid.Overwatch thrives on heroes chosen and synergy woven. Each character, a distinctive asset, harmonizing or clashing with companions. Before, new heroes graced us yearly, free for all. Now OW2 expects toil or toll, Battlepass coin to unlock novelties (or £9 for the old guard).Superficially, not cataclysmic. But mull over queuing for ranked skirmishes without the complete cast.Essential gameplay locked behind gold bars in a contest of competence.Fair fight? Picture a team with riches of choices battling a lesser-equipped squad. Pay-to-win whispers, but I'll let you muse.#2 - The Masquerade of the Battlepass and Cosmetic CharadesI've embraced Battlepasses, yet OW2's rendition is a jest. Eighty tiers brimming, often 8 skins (a customizable gem at the end) flanked by trinkets and fillers, the norm. Trivia, titles, tokens, perhaps even dreams. Credit inclusion is a stride, but does it mend the fundamental blunder of barricading core play behind a toll?Overwatch's essence thrives in skins sculpted by da Vinci's heirs, yet prices sting. Legendaries (beyond mere recolors) average £20+, quite the toll.Once lootbox blessings flowed, earned with each level, frequent as heartbeat. Boxes bought rarely, yet the trove brimmed. Claiming lootbox woes, they unveiled a store, yet by 2019 (three years past birth) Overwatch pocketed $1 billion in loot's embrace.Skins trickle to a parched river. Challenge grind, months for one legendary.#3 - The PvE MiragePvE, distant horizon, yet Overwatch 2's vanguard. Deception's dance followed, dressed as a gameplay gale. Even post-PvE's dirge, it lingers, parcels for sale, another coin pluck.In Awe or DefianceFor gunfight lovers, Overwatch 2's heart is hollow.Cosmetic nomads, surrender your gold hoard.Thrills echo, love persists, yet swindled by ravenous hands, a somber refrain.In this cacophony, my recommendation wanes like a fading star."

KacperM16,0,August 11,15,,4,Not Recommended,"Where do I even start...I've actually quite enjoyed this iteration of Overwatch. BUT we can't forget about all that was promised to us, and what was taken from us. Let's start with the Battle Pass. It SUCKS ASS. I NEVER PAID FOR  ANY LOOTBOX AND STILL HAVE 10+ SKINS ON EVERY HERO(not to mention the poses, graffiti and stuff). Now, it's impossible because the prices are overkill. Also, locking heroes behind battle pass is DUMB and SHOULD BE REMOVED or lowered to like tier 5 or 10. Recent cancelation and then revival of PVE is concerning. We were promised story mode - ability trees and all that stuff that got people excited. What we got? 8 or so paid missions for riddiculus prices. No ability upgrades, no story mode, nothing.I would write more about this game, but I'll keep it short -  all this contet -  new maps, heroes, modes - could be implemented piece by piece into Overwatch 1. For what we expected, this game failed, and not even new hentai can undo the damage."

fish with moustache,0,August 12,8,,0,Not Recommended,"The year is 2017. I have a copy of Overwatch and I played it religiously. For a socially-awkward teenager, Overwatch was the perfect game with relatable characters, and an inspirational message. ""Never accept the world as it appears to be, dare to see it for what it could be""Overwatch formed a big part of my extensive history with gaming, I reconnected with one of my peers from my childhood over Overwatch, and we continue to be best friends to this day. I spent a good amount of money on lootboxes, overwatch league tokens, Atlantic all-star and pink Mercy skins, because I thought I was supporting my favourite game, which, despite it shortcomings, still made an effort to respect me as a consumer of the product.When Overwatch 2 was first announced, I was ecstatic to hear of endless replayability and hero customisation. But days turned to months, turned to years and Overwatch was left to die. We, the community, held out hope that Overwatch 2 will launch with an epic revival, ushering in a new age of PvE gameplay, but it never happened.Overwatch 2 will never capture the magic Overwatch had in its early years. This half-baked sequel full of broken promises and insane monetisation is a spit in loyal fans' faces. A pachimari keychain costs less in real life than it does in game (https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/yf9w5o/it_cost_me_less_to_buy_this_charm_in_real_life/). What does that tell you about what Blizzard thinks of you, the player? To them, the community is just group of idiots with poor spending habits who will line their pockets with each skin they release. My journey with Overwatch ends here. I will not support the company that killed my favourite game, and I recognise that my support means nothing to them, but if it's the least I can do for the original Overwatch, then that is my duty.0/10 scummy business practices. Game deserves to die a second time."

																Overwatch is the game that made me purchase my first gaming computer when i was just 12 years old. I was having the most fun i ever had in a video game and met a friend that has stuck with me for all these years. Just like how i stuck to playing this game through all these years no matter the changes they made allways hoping for them to announce the Sequel with an official release date to buy it for me and my friend. Now im almost 19 and feel depressed everytime i open that damn game hoping for some sort of entertainment. The feeling of utter dissapointed after being promised so much and not even receiving the small product they produced without paying hundreds of dollars for Battle passes or Story missions is just insane. I dont know how long i will keep playing this for and if i could even bring myself to play it again after quitting because this game left a hole in my gaming heart."

I can't describe how perfect it was, maps, characters, loot system, pay once for the game and that's it, etc.Now we have OW2 which is littered with monetisation, battle passes, locked heroes, content behind pay walls, removal of player level frames, not to mention reducing 6v6 to 5v5 on the same maps that were made for 6v6. They promised PVE if you pre-ordered it, which lots of us did, now they announce they have cancelled PVE and have put story missions behind ANOTHER pay wall at $20 a pop.Overwatch has gone from one of the best games I have ever played to a money grabbing, sexuality pushing (#LeaveTheKidsAlone), hot mess of a game and I highly recommend investing your time elsewhere."

Rat Squeak Henderson,0,August 29,5,,0,Not Recommended,"Winston sent the call to assemble the Overwatch team, but no one showed up. Alas, the beast was stunned, gawk and aghast. ""Who was responsible for this?"" he wondered. ""Blackwatch? They disbanded years ago. Talon? Too obvious... Null Sector? No, for what did they stand to gain?"" he pondered. Then it dawned on him:After Winston installed the chronal harness, there was a complication. Lena momentarily disappeared from conventional reality and found herself trapped in a mirror universe, identical to Earth, but fifty years in the past. Lena was no longer in her native timeline, and could not contact Overwatch command. After wandering the city for hours, a group of undesirable men catcalled her. Soon enough, fifteen non-binary bodybuilders lept from a nearby bush, and began beating the men in a hailstorm of pink, green, and blue. Fedoras flew, neck-beards grazed flesh, and pocket protectors were broken in twain. Reddit gold fell to the ground as the evil men were brutally killed, whilst onlookers clapped in delight. Tracer was confused, ""What year is this and where am I?"" she asked. A 5'4"" man with childish features, a spindly Van ♥♥♥♥ beard, and thick glasses, pushed his way through the crowd. ""Tracer my love, you are in Irvine, California. The year is 2020, and might I say... You look absolutely bewitching on this fine afternoon. Mayhaps you accompany me to the local smoothie stand where I might buy you a green juice, and we can discuss this trifling matter further?"" the man suggested, cupping his pot-belly with skinny arms. Initially hesitant, she accepted, needing answers to the predicament she found herself in.""So what's going on, why am I here?"" she asked. The man laughed. ""Tracer, my dear sweet princess of an orange peel, you are famous here. This is the first time a video-game character has come to the real world"". She didn't understand what he meant. ""Um, I don't know what you're talking about"" she shrugged. ""Tracer, please. My queen, my bright shining star, it is fate that we met here. I believe our destinies are intertwined. Thusly, I have a mite proposal for you. Should you accept, I can help you find your way"" the pear-shaped man prayed. Tracer was not convinced. ""Tell me what it is first, then we can go from there"" she urged. The frail man-child had green juice on his beard as he recited the words he had carefully rehearsed prior. ""Be my wife, marry me and I can fix you. I want to help you, because I love you. I've dreamt of this moment, for years. Please, don't say no, I might do something terrible, to myself more than anyone else, and it will be your fault. I'll say you manipulated me, and they'll believe me because I'm a man, flesh and blood, whilst you are a cartoon woman, made of polygons and shaders. Please, consider your response carefully"" he begged.Lena was speechless. ""Firstly, I'm a lesbian. Secondly, I don't find you attractive in the slightest. If you think you can manipulate my confusion because I'm lost and alone then you're wrong. You seem like a weak and pathetic man, who only gets laid when he does something illegal. Stop creeping on me, get a life"" she scoffed. The corner of the man-boy's lip twitched. ""We could make SFM together, but in real life"" he whispered, leaning closer. ""We won't be doing any of that"" she rebuffed, reclining away from him. His eyes became milky white, and his pupils were pitch black. His face didn't move, neither did his body, any shade of uncertainty in his mannerisms disappeared. ""I have a gun,"" he said. Tracer scowled in defiance, her face twisted into an expression of rage, mingling with disgust. ""Wait a minute, what does that badge say?"". She looked down at his breast, and it read in bold text, ""Lesley Boyman, Acquisitions, Blizzard Entertainment"". It was at this point that the man began visibly sweating. In a horrifying silence that seemed to last forever, neither said a word. She spat on him and disappeared in a snap of particles. Lesley looked down at the saliva on his Oxhorn v-neck, rubbed his middle finger on it, and licked it hungrily.It was no surprise that the call wasn't answered, their world was fake, the product of a company so drunk on appetites that it had forgotten what it was. For an intellect as formidable as his, it was a surprise that he never went mad from the revelation. He grabbed his jar of peanut butter, and dug his hand in, waiting for the end to come. Sure enough, a boot kicked the door down. It was Gabriel Reyes. ""Monkey, I've had a change of heart, I believe we should join forces"" he grumbled. Winston looked nonplussed, disenchanted, and morose. ""Reaper, Overwatch is done, I'm done, today is my last day on Earth"" he muttered, eating his last handful of peanut butter. ""But Winston, you don't understand, I am a changed man, just like Cole Cassidy. I don't have to live in fear of what I have become. I learned the truth, much like everyone else did. I am a man with no heart, a pathetic mess, and the secret is in my name"" he pressed. ""I just don't care anymore Gabriel, what do you mean by that, what does it matter? What secret do you speak of?"" the monkey fumbled. ""So you know how I'm called Reaper? Cool name right, I learnt something, remove the E from my name that comes after the first R. What do you get? What does it spell?!"" he asked with an eyebrow raised and a smirk...Winston, sincerely amused for the first time in a while, grabbed Reaper and hugged him. They laughed, cried, and wept tears of joy, sadness, and regret. ""You know, that is funny Gabriel, do me a favour. Your gun, please"" he requested. ""Of course"" Reaper uttered with gusto and rare concern. Winston smiled at him, never breaking eye contact as he placed the shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. Nothing was left of him but his brains splattered on the wall. Reaper felt sad for the monkey. Embracing his new identity, Gabriel re-entered the world, no longer fearing what he was, wearing his new face. He had a new name, and a new destiny. The hero of his own journey. He knew he would never get in trouble, and that he would never face the consequences, and with Overwatch gone, he was filled with hope, ambition, and love."

Puts every tiny piece of content on a pedestal like its the Mona Lisa, only for a lot of it to then expire like fruit.Oh yeah, and it's made by a rapidly turning to crap company, while the people at the top rub their hands with glee at all the easy money they make at the expense of their players and working staff.Oh yeah! And let's not forget how they keep rewriting character lore and posting it on news sites like it's a f!*king baby shower, to try and cover up whatever their latest bit of bad PR they got is.The art style is solid for what it is, but that's one of the few things it has left going for it on this unbalanced mess. The game doesn't even have a good sense of humor! With the majority of the best things to come out of overwatch all being fan content which Blizzard has little to no appreciation for. I feel bad for the staff who worked there who had no control where the game ended up, but the rest of them? Deserve all this BS they get.

Aard,0,August 15,5,,3,Not Recommended,"Game is not Free-2-Play; Gameplay; PvE, is locked behind paywallOverwatch 1 was a competitive shooter with the only thing available for purchase cosmetic lootboxes that could be earned in game, hence the progression and store was cosmetic only, and loot boxes are gamba, but was fair in the spot that mattered, the game. Overwatch 2 is a Pay 2 win competitive shooter that allows players to purchase strong heroes for an immediate advantage a in all game modes outside of the training range. These heroes you can pay to access are extremely powerful and all but one have landed in the most used by the top players in the world. There is no progression unless money is handed over for a season pass fill with %90 utter garbage bloat, so no progression for 'free' players no PvE for 'free' players and yet some people still think that OW2 is better than OW1.OW2 replaced OW1, destroying both progression and integrity.We should take whoever thinks OW2 is the better version to a psychiatrist so they can then get help from a psychologist, because they clearly have something wrong with them if they can't understand how P2W without progression is worse than having progression without P2W.Then again, that massive streamer who thinks this also thinks Season Passes are ethical, so clearly they don't have a brain to be checked in the first place."
verb,0,August 12,3,,1,Not Recommended,"played ow1 since beta. game was fun. got pretty good at it. game took a nosedive when they gave up balancing around goats and introduced role lock. game was dead in the water for years after ow2 announcement. in 2022 blizzard dragged out a half baked microtransaction sequel. game has lost it's identity, inspiration and vision. there are talented people working on this game, unfortunately the product is boring, watered down mishmash of concepts that have come before it. financial model is also laughable. microsoft needs to bring this game around the back of the shed and put it out of it's misery like the shaking senile dog that it is."

HaveaHeart,0,August 11,13,,0,Not Recommended,"When Blizzard decided to end competitive Heroes of the Storm, they announced surprise layoffs of staff, ended contracts with teams, and pulled support for a competitive scene hosted by the game developer itself.  This led to the mass exodus of players with skill to other games in order to find monetary support for their gaming prowess.  When these top players left, a power vacuum was created at the top of the ranked charts that was filled by high ranked players streaming because they can't make similar money in other games and players who should have been ranked sometimes two tiers lower.  With the announcement of Blizzard devaluing OWL and signaling the end of sponsored competitive, Overwatch will follow the same path.Without the support of Blizzard creating a competitive scene, the top tier of Overwatch competition will be come mediocre and unreliable at best.  The value of finding and securing a rank becomes almost meaningless and is based on number of games played, not skill during games played.Oh and they started locking characters behind the Battlepass.  Imagine."

A Digital Dog,0,August 17,4,,0,Not Recommended,"I only downloaded Overwatch 2 on Steam so I could leave this review and finally get rid of Battle.netNow, review time. Simply put, this game is bad. You can like it, but if you try to tell yourself this game is good you're delusional. Players should not settle for what AAA studios give them just because the developers don't want to put in the effort of making a GOOD game. The entire point of making Overwatch into a new game was to revive the dying playerbase and bring an engaging, rich PvE experience on top of the PvP we've had for years now. But in classic AAA Dev fashion, they're repurposing most of their team into making models and content for their BS FOMO Battle Pass model.Go play TF2. Valve has hardly given it any support over the past decade, but at least the game is fun and doesn't want to syphon you for every dollar you have. For any OW2 Diehards out there. No, nothing in TF2 is mandatory to pay for. You can experience every mode and map the game has to offer for free. It is only when you want cosmetics that you begin to pay to play the game. MvM is totally free to play, you just will not earn the real money rewards.Which is another plus of TF2, you can earn in game items and sell them for REAL money to your Steam wallet. Instead of having buyer's remorse when you can't refund the cheap Battle Pass skin you didn't really want.TLDR; Overwatch 2 sucks. Blizzard sucks, they still employ rapists and misogynists. Go play TF2, you'll have a better time."

MVestiige,0,August 14,4,,43,Not Recommended,"Been playing this game since the very first beta of the original game. The state this incredibly unique franchise has become is atrocious, and just utterly sad.It's very clear that Blizzard's main focus on this ""sequel"" (which has supposedly left early access, by the way) is just microtransactions and pumping out content that feels very empty and poor effort in an attempt to keep the playerbase subdued.Since the PvE got stripped down to barebones, nothing else out of the new Invasion season feels unique or replayable after a couple hours. The new heroes they have been bringing out, minus Junker Queen and Ramattra, since they were original characters since OW1, have felt so bland and lackluster as well. Nothing of this game feels fun to return to.It's just upsetting that something as unique and HUGE as Overwatch once was is now in this miserable state.I can't recommend it anymore. I really can't.If there is any hope for this game, let's hope Microsoft can do something about it. Otherwise; R.I.P.PS: I have over 2,200 hours total on this game, so this isn't a fresh review that's joyriding the negative reviews that are ""doing their part"", I'm genuinely upset this game is awful to play now.

OW1 was making enough money selling lootboxes, and if they'd continued to make more costumes, they'd continue making lootbox money, and that was fine.

I still find OW2 fun and I think the decision to add the game to Steam was a good decision, but they took a lot of bad decisions along the way and I still find that OW1 was much more fun compared to OW2, which is insane considering that it actually has had new content constantly... It's just not interesting new content. That plus the old lootbox system is missed. It went from being one of the healthiest lootbox/skin systems to ever exist back in Overwatch 1 to one of the worst and most boring, it feels little rewarding at all. If you play this game, play it with friends (only sometimes), in its current state, it's probably the only way that the game is fun.

TheGamingDusty,0,August 15,6,,13,Not Recommended,"I was a huge Overwatch fan, but I was slowly pushed away by Blizzards unwillingness to ignore the feelings of pro players. Never get use to anything. They will pull a mechanic, rework an entire character, and apparently, nuke an entire game to give players a far worse anti-consumer store. Pros get to tell Blizzard how to change the game, and the actual player base gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥ over via locked characters, $20 skins, and the slowest battlepass I've ever seen. The pro's are the reason i left. Constant reworks and changes just to make pro players happy. They can't not change things that don't need touching. I only return to Overwatch now because it's free AND on steam. I held off until now because of the first games nuking. I wouldn't be nearly as upset if the first was left up. That way we could stay there with no more crazy character reworks. the fact that you pulled a Culling 2/GTA Trilogy makes every move Blizzard worse. This games not all that bad (game play wise), but there treatment of the community has earned them all the hate they get. If you are new, don't get Overwatch 2. This game will get nuked in a few years for Overwatch 3 anyways. Don't waist your time."

Ananymous,0,August 10,7,,25,Not Recommended,"An empty shell of what it used to be An OG Overwatch player here, I don't recomment spending a dime on this game. Why? Because:1. They stopped updating Overwatch 1 and kept it like that for 2 - 3 years, so that they can give us a proper campaign / PvE mode in OW2. But then they cancelled the said PvE to focus more on their battle pass.2. They removed essential things from the game like leveling up, performance cards after matches, votes, on fire, portraits etc. Removing them degraded the games quality of life. It's now just a shallow version of its formal self.3. They have a very aggresive and bad monetization system with horrible battle pass in this game. I have almost all the good skins unlocked for free. But if a new player wanted to get them for free they have to grind for god knows how long. Maybe for 10 years? Either that or pay! That is completely unacceptable. They should at the very least make the previous skins from OW1 more easily achievable.These 3 are the major points on why I don't recommend spending any money on this game. At it's core it once was a nice game and new player can still enjoy it a bit these days. But spending money here will only send a message to blizzard that they can get away with anything. I love this game and I want it to change for the better. So I recommend, vote with your wallet and don't spend a dime unless they change their ways."

If frickin black ops 1 loads up and finds a match faster on xbox in 2023 than a modern game, something is clearly wrong!"
Projekt,0,August 13,3,,36,Not Recommended,"TLDR Overwatch 2 is a great game at its core, but it was ruined by the developers and greed of the higher-ups at Blizzard, giving us the system we wanted the ""Blizzard way"" (scroll down to player feedback to see). I'm a 2016 ow player, former top 500 dps, and masters tank/support. These are the reasons this game is currently in the worst state it's been in, and why you should wait to try it. So why should you wait to play this game? The dev team has no idea what the heck they are doing with balance changes. They nerf the wrong thing, and they overbuff other characters. I have never seen a dev team so out of touch with balance changes; it's like they don't understand their own game. Another reason why you should wait is that they can fix the store going down in 5 minutes, but a bug with a character's ultimate isn't fixed for an entire season. It feels like they have given up the competitive nature of the game and only put effort into updating the cosmetics in the shop. Why does it feel this way because Blizzard completely revamped the comp scene? You can no longer see your rank or that of your teammates while in game unless they have their profile set to the public, which no one does! You can no longer see who is good at what hero and build a comp around the one trick who can't play anything else. You will also never know how far you are into a rank. I have gone 5-3 just to drop down 2 divisions. How the ♥♥♥♥ do I go positive and drop rank blizzard? The math aint mathing. The matchmaker is also the worst I have ever seen. You get plats in GM lobbies like wtf. I can't even que with a plat player. Why are they in my game? It makes no sense. They have taken matchmaking integrity and thrown it out the window for faster queue times. Another issue is balance changes. These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ balance the win rate and pick rate, which includes bronze to GM. This explains why it took Sojourn so long to get nerfed, because collectively, she wasn’t a problem because anyone in plat and under can’t aim, keeping her win rate and pick rate in check. Put her in a high-rated lobby, and she is dominating the game. Now for the most recent changes, Zen. I have never seen a team so dumb when it comes to balancing the issue with the character. Zen has an ability called discord, which amplifies the amount of damage a target takes. We switched from 6v6 to 5v5. You pop the discord on the tank, and the tank is shredded. All they had to do was nerf the amount of damage it amplifies, but that's not how we balance at blizzard. Clearly, the range of discord is too long, so they nerfed it by 10 meters and made it go away 0.5 of a second faster when out of line of sight. They buff and nerf the wrong parts of heroes over and over and over again, and they never fix the real problem. It was the same with OW1, and it just feels much worse now. They also make healers have way too much utility, and damage. The fact that I have games where the supports are out-damaging every DPS player is insane. On top of that, they have the best utility in the game. They keep adding the most brain dead heroes that get value for just being alive or pressing one button. The skill ceiling and floor are way too low compared to other characters. They have gotten out of jail free cards simply by pressing a button. A DPS can be out of position if your entire team dives them and the enemy presses one button, they are completely safe, or the support is on an off-angle doing DPS. Our team goes to take care of it, and they press one button and get back to their team without any consequences. They have enough damage to two shot 200 hp heroes. Another problem is Kiriko. Why the ♥♥♥♥ does she have a do everything button, great damage (2 shots, 200 HP heroes), no damage fall off, and a get out of jail free card? She cleanses, heals, and immoralizes all with one button. On top of that, she does 120 damage per headshot and has a button to get out of any situation she puts herself in. They keep buffing and nerfing her recovery from healing when all they need to do is make the immortality button either do immor or cleanse; it shouldn't do both and it shouldn’t heal. Don't even get me started on widow, hanzo, sojourn, Ram, and queen. My tank is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. My friends all make fun of me when I play it because I have the knowledge of how I should play the role at a high level of play, but I can't perform what I should be doing, But with the power of Ram and Queen, I am now a masters tank (DLC for the win). They have no idea how to reign in the power creep they have added over the past couple of years, nor do they know how to fix the overbuffed characters they currently have. They added new, better one-shot characters, and they took away all crowd control for DPS making ball and doom busted for a season. They buffed the ♥♥♥♥ out of McCree's grenade to where it's not fun to play against as a flanker because it latches on to you and makes it to where you can't play the game. It's a heat seeking missile stopping you from moving. Make it a skill shot so it feels rewarding to the player and the person dying to it. This is just one of the recent changes. This doesn’t include goats, double snipers, double shields, or other metas. Their balancing and management of the game have killed Overwatch League. They gave up on their streamers, league talents, and the game and left us all to rot for 2 years to come back and take away the game we loved and turned it into a 5v5 pile of ♥♥♥♥. Was Overwatch 1 perfect? No, it had a lot of problems, but it was way better than the ♥♥♥♥ we are dealing with now. The developers need to do a rework of the entire cast to fit the 5v5 format and add new maps. I'm tired of playing on the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ new maps over and over again. Another reason is that this game is way too counter-pick focused at the high level of play. They advertised how you won’t need to counterpick in OW2, and you can once trick your favorite hero. WRONG. They made the game more counterpick-focused. You play poke, brawl, and dive. If you're playing DVA, have fun against a zarya and pray your teammates are smart enough not to charge the bubbles (even in high ranks, they aren't smart enough to know that). If you want to play Doom, have fun going against Orisa, Sombra, and Ana for the remainder of the match, so you can't play the game. Let's talk about the new way heroes are being added to the game. They lock them behind a paywall or level 45 in the battle pass, which, depending on if you do challenges and how much you play, can take anywhere from 20 hours to weeks to complete. Every new character will be over-tuned on release now since Life Weaver got so much hate for being too weak. So now be ready for a meta character every season to come out and break the game until the developers get their ♥♥♥♥ together and balance the game. They still haven’t done that with Kiriko or Sojourn. They giga buffed Queen because they didn’t like how she wasn’t played that much and forced a meta around another DLC hero. They couldn’t see the only reason she wasn’t played that much was because they nerfed her shout-off launch to where speed doesn't’ stack with Lucio, and Kiriko completely counters her entire ult with a click of a button that's on a 14-second cooldown. Queen is the hero that helped me get to masters because I was playing dps tank instead of tank. Some people compare the new heroes being locked behind a paywall or grind to valorant, apex, and league of legends. These people don’t understand the game and why it works differently. Can you unlock the hero for free? Yes, there is a way to do that. I 100% agree, but if you don’t have that hero, for whatever reason, you are now at a massive disadvantage or forcing your teammates to be at a massive disadvantage. The perfect example of this is Sojourn. When Sojourn was released, she was the most broken character in the game. It was sojourn vs. sojourn; the rest of the team didn’t matter. If you didn’t have"

Icey,0,August 25,5,,1,Not Recommended,"When I bought Overwatch 1, they said that they are charging money so that in a game all about synergy, no options would be limited. They said that we will never have to pay extra for additional content, and that it is to ensure a great experience. I have been a fan of Blizzard since Starcraft 1. They have consistently put out good, well rounded games even if we've had to wait a bit for it. So I trusted the company. Then they took the game we paid for away with almost no compensation. They made it the opposite of what they originally intended and slapped a 2 on top.

Mr. Devlar,0,August 16,3,,25,Not Recommended,"Please do not give Blizzard any more money. This game is a corpse of the game I used to love and a stunning example of how the profit seeking parasitic executive class ruins everything they touch.- Game is unbalanced as the characters are unbalanced. New character, who is locked behind a paywall, is always overpowered on launch. Some older characters who are very clearly overpowered have never been addressed. Probably because they are running a skeleton dev team at this point.- Game is unbalanced because matchmaking is horrible. 80% of matches are stomps with one side overwhelming the other without contest. Smurfing (or high level players who pretend to be low level) is common and because they pay for their alt accounts and generate revenue, their effect on the game is left unaddressed. Free to play has made this situation exponentially worse.- Community is toxic. It is impossible to play with coms on in this game without getting people venting their anger at everyone. Vitriol is common. The newer voice lines between characters in OW2 have only added fuel to the community's disposition. This game would be impossible to play without the ability to turn off all coms.This situation is truly sad, considering how much better the game used to be before these issues took hold."

mewingtons,0,August 14,3,,0,Not Recommended,"Talk about a group of developers that never listen to their player base. When people make obvious suggestions to the game, the developers do the OPPOSITE. Think they'll make logical changes when new updates come out? Think again. They'll make ILLOGICAL changes. There's no rhyme or reason for their constant bad decisions. It's like they no nothing about the original Overwatch or games in general, and they keep finding ways to destroy Overwatch 2. Just when you think they can't make worse decisions, they'll find ways to top it. It's honestly impressive. I'll also add that they have been promising PVE content since before the game launched, only to release the game without PVE content and a crappy battle pass system. They've only just recently added a piss poor PVE story mode, and you have to pay FIFTEEN DOLLARS for it. If you ever wondered what true incompetence looked like, well, here it is."

exi,0,August 13,3,,30,Not Recommended,add sex and I will reconsider this review.
Mr. Cele,1,August 13,4,,0,Not Recommended,"I downloaded this again to write a reviewI'll  try to write an honest review hereI have according to my profile in game 156 hours clocked in.I bought this game back when it came out on the Beta phase, back then I was seriously pissed that Blizzard didn't acknowledged they took inspiration from Team Fortress 2, going above and beyond to erase any comments, ban people on twitch chat, erase forum posts instead citing to call of duty as the inspiration, well fast forward I still compare this to TF2 and it still falls short from the fun factor that game provides.Let's start:Gameplay:The game is solid it has always had great gun-play and satisfying movement.Netcode:Back in 2016 I raged at the ""shotee wins"" system instead of the ""shooter wins"" philosophy they adopted, for the uninitiated allow me to explain: net code wise the game calculates your position multiple times a second to check where you are and some games do a clever trick where with an algorithm they calculate your possible movements to compensate for lag, this is not something new, something similar is used in newer fighting games with GGPO. Back in topic, this system allowed blizzard to give people with bad connections a fighting chance, this sounds great in paper right? The problem was the implementation of it using the philosophy of the guy who was shot has an advantage, let's say you are playing tracer with a bad connection and someone is shooting at you and it's about to kill you and you break line of sight with a wall, in most online games you would be killed because on the screen of the shooter you were not yet behind cover. But with this new way of doing things the system would favor the person with a bad connection and you as the shooter would see the last hit not count this was quickly picked up by many and abused by using small plugins, .Jsons, scripts that introduced artificial lag allowing them to gain an upper hand in combat, cheaters aside for some reason back then Battle.net would match with with people too far away from you, Brazil being a constant (you could check this by seeing on windows the IP server to which Overwatch was doing a connection) I quit the game back then for the span of months.Fast forward they ironed the system out and regardless of the Shotee wins you can barely feel it on a normal match nowadays, still for the purposes of a review this is a minus as it should have not happened at all.Skill floor: easy to pick up and playSkill Ceiling: I thought Blizzard games were all about easy to pick hard to master, this doesn't feel like it's the case anymore at blizzard it feels more like ""cater to casuals, maximize profit"" OW feels a bit weaker when I compare it to TF2, as highly skilled players in TF2 make a greater difference on any given match, while in Overwatch it doesn't feel as big of a presence, I would argue Overwatch needs to allow great players to stomp on weaker ones, specially considering Blizz saying they took inspiration from titles such as Unreal Tournament and Quake. I don't see TF2 Soldiers rocket jumping into boot squash a n00b across the map just to RJ escape and while shooting a rocket at some one else only for a Pyro to use it to push into ground to RJ himself to chase that soldier in the air and kill him with an Axe!!Sorry out of character for me.Game modes: while people only talk about competitive and casual matches I feel the other modes OW introduced are great, I always criticized they being seasonal, to me it felt like a strategy to keep you playing in fear of missing out rewards.Community maps not accounted here since that is not Blizz's making.Balance: I feel this has not been solved all these years later, back in TF2 you didn't get new classes but weapons that changed skills and made them variations of the class, some changing how the class was played completely, Overwatch went for the character path and somehow matches still feel off, newer heroes as a general rule feel over tuned bar some exceptions, in my eyes locking team compositions killed most of the fun of the game as for me being able to quickly adapt was a key component of the gameplay loop. Class roles feel a bit of a lie to me as they can do many things besides being a Defense/Support/Offense/TanksGraphics and Design: Top notch not much to say here, the maps are gorgeous, the graphics look great even on potato PCs running the game on low, artstyle it's what I expect from Blizzard and character design, I mean there's a reason there is so much P*rn out there.Speaking of P*rn I know Blizz will never acknowledge it but the reason OW became popular to begin with was the P*rn and it needs to be said.Music and Sound Design:fantastic the music is great although the leitmotif might feel forced into everything at times, sound design it's the best for me as skills have specific sounds, footsteps let you know which character it's about to come out of a corner, voices are clear and the voice acting is great regardless of language as I played it in multiple languages over the years.Story: What story?!?!??!?Progression: honestly I don't like it, feels generic levels, the lootbox system was the begining of a dark age of gaming as it popularized and fortunately slowed down when EA stepped way too far with Starwars Battlefront 2Medals for you levels are great, but I feel there is no real bragging rights attached to it, No special cosmetics or anything.UI: Feels good, I would like a bit more numeric information but it's a solid 10 out of 10Monetization: God awful, skins were expensive to begin with having them attached to the lootbox system and made worse after the switch to OW2 with skyhigh prices and obnoxious battlepass system.Not a fan of the battle pass even though I was one of the first to applaud Dota 2's battle pass back in 2013.Since I started talking about monetization now I have to talk about OW2, to begin with the 2 is a lie, it's no secret, everyone feels the same. The game doesn't warrant the 2 on it's name, hardly an expansion, from the minor things of hero introductions feeling lifeless now to the blatant cashgrab that it feels like. Yes the game went F2P, but we all know they did this have a second ""Release"" window and monetize the F out their customers.New maps are great, new characters feel nice to play, wouldn't call them brilliant or groundbreaking in terms of innovation though.The steam release I feel was a low move trying to get a third ""Release"" window and people see though it, coming hot from the fiasco of the story mode gutted off the game, the sole reason the game had the 2 in the name to begin with.I had the chance to closely work in the Esports scene for OW as an organizer and a shoutcaster.We hated working with OW, the spectator mode it's a joke, having CS:GO's client as shining example of an spectator mode. We worked closely with the amazing people at Blizzard Mexico, I only have praises for them.But also very inflexible, we programmed our own API to get more game data in search of bettering the spectator experience, and Blizz HQ in CA shut us down while pitching it to them.Once the OW League started all community hype died out as they would never have a shot at the big leagues unlike other games where you can climb up raking competitive points.That aside watching OW matches is Boring AF, as a caster you make boring stuff interesting, theorize on the fly, take analytical data from previous matches, make predictions, but when you gut the game so hard as to have restricted classes, a lot of that goes down the drain, not having that bird's eye for the longest time also hurt the viewership.I am aware many of these have been fixed and corrected, but it's too little to late, as the hype dies down the longer you take. Case in point: the OW League being a huge disaster.OW I feel it's basically over, it's reversible. But today August 13 2023 I cannot recommend anyone play OWgo Play TF2 instead and have a blast"

The Tatted Native,0,August 13,3,,3,Not Recommended,"After enjoying Overwatch 1 for many many hours, and finding good friends on it and playing engaging pvp, I am severely disappointed with Overwatch 2.     They got rid of a lot of features I adore, and after promising pve play at launch (for people who pre purchased a specific bundle) they suddenly change their minds, and waited until like 2 days ago to release 4 pathetic missions with ANOTHER DLC. So I have purchased 2 separate DLC'S for the pve play and got shafted.    Battle pass system's are becoming outdated. I would have been more than happy to purchase the full game, if everything came included with future patches/updates.   If you are someone who has not yet played this game, but are interested, take my word for it. Pass on this one. Go and buy Baldurs Gate 3, because THATS how a development company should make games. No micro transactions, everything included at launch."

So, all that's left for me is to watch the cutscenes on YouTube, because the lore and cinematic team are doing the only thing that still reminds us of the old times at Blizzard: good content."

Escalusia,0,August 12,3,,0,Not Recommended,"My honest review of Overwatch, as someone who played since OW1 Beta and Launch, and someone who has always played Blizzard games.Overwatch was the first and only FPS I was ever able to enjoy. I loved the art style, I love how snappy and clean the game felt. It felt like that Blizzard polish people would always talk about.Back in OW1, I loved sitting in queue to even get in the game when a new hero or event would launch. For events, I'd always buy 50 lootboxes and my friends and I would look through the newest Christmas Wonderland, or whatever event, skins to see which ones we should try and earn, or which skin we'd want to spend 3k credits on. It was a routine, for every event. I'm not beyond spending money in a game, but with the way OW2 is, you'd be without a home if you were to buy everything you thought was cool. The magic of events is gone. You look through the new skins, which each cost $19 or so. An insane price for something you used to get for free, and something you hardly see when actually playing the character.The battle pass is also insane. For 80 levels, you don't even get 10 skins, or if so, only barely. The rest is padded out with relatively useless stuff. You don't get the premium currency to buy the next pass either. Sure, you get legacy credits, but they are hardly useful as you get so little, or for me who has everything they can buy and 13k more to spare from OW1. They took away a game I loved, in promise there'd be PvE and progression and story, but what I got was a massive fee to get anything in the game. PvE is not necessarily cancelled, but in truth it is. There are PvE missions, which are only 15min ish each, and you have to pay to play them, but without any replayability or progression. That was what we were promised. There'll also be many months between getting new missions. For something that only lasts 15 min, it's not worth paying for.To buy a single OW2 skin, I can pay for a WoW subscription. Though the games are not at all similar, the amount of content you get out of your money is insane. There's so many games you can buy for the same price as some of these ""bundles"" of recycled content.Because every skin, the pass, the heroes, the events, all cost money to some degree, there's no reason to be excited about anything. If i had to spend $20 every time a new shop item came out, or a new event dropped, or $10 to get the pass, I could easily have bought so many games by now. Games full of content, and certainly stories longer than 15 min.I am not a hater of this game, on the contrary, I love the game a lot.But there's no soul or integrity left of it. It's all for money, and the game I purchased is gone.I respect the developers who make this game, and has put so much of their talent and love into it. They are not responsbile for what it has become.This is not a review bombing, this is me missing and lamenting a game that they killed and replaced with a cashgrab.The good:- Visually beautiful game, with a large cast of fun characters- Fun Mechanics The bad:- They are only trying to pry open your waller- The soul of the game is lost- The battlepass is bad- The skins are insanely expensive- Pay to play story missions- The balancing is always rattledThe sad:- Just a fan wishing I could look at the event skins with my friends and we could all dress up without having to spend money, and loads of it combined. Missing being excited for this game."

You will become a worse person for playing this game. The lore and character designs are pretty cool and the only thing to even play the game for, but it is far from worth it. The community is not the only thing that makes this game horrible, but the developers too. Pay 40$ for your invasion bundle and get the battle pass plus access to the pve missions mode.

Astolfo,0,August 11,3,,26,Not Recommended,"I’m gonna do a genuine review cause I don’t think anybody should play this game despite me playing it. Overwatch is pretty clear that the devs don’t play their game. With the mid season 5 patch notes, they’ve stated that they’ve buffed headshot damage to a spam character to “promote accuracy.” Not only that, they ONLY look at statistics for their games and see if stuff is working. The downside is they’ll see a character have a 50% win rate and think it’s balanced. But the character can be super boring to play. Another aspect is they’ve completely gutted their PvE despise the whole selling point for overwatch 2 is the PvE. It’s just sad, and embarrassing. Even though they’ve switched their dedication to the PvP. It’s still super frustrating to play. They’ll take forever if one character is busted, if the change isn’t good. You have to wait another 30 days to see if that patch notes is good. Not only that, the whole Activision Blizzard team don’t care about their employees or their player base. With the terrible lawsuit including stuff such as stealing breast milk, sexual harassment which caused one of their workers to suicide, and unfair treatment to their women workers. It’s just sick reading through the allegations of the lawsuit itself. Not only they lack care in their workplace, they don’t care about you as a player. They gutted Overwatch 1 just to monetize heavily off of you, the balancing of this game is absurd and overwatch lying to us for the PvE. At this point, if you want a F2P team based shooter. Play team fortress 2. If you want to spend $15, I recommend buying a game that comes from labor of love instead coming from a horrible soulless industry. I personally recommend playing Oneshot, great game. If you still want a PvP game. Get Battlebit Remastered. Somehow a 3 dev team can add more content than an AAA studio."

CakesInAPan,0,August 11,3,,40,Not Recommended,"I have been an avid player of Overwatch since its first release in 2016. Don't get me wrong, this game is very fun and I still play to this day (I'm at well over 2000 hours through Battle.net). I do think that if you haven't tried the game yet, you should definitely check it out for free, but it is not worth it to spend another dime on this game than what has already been invested by players over the years -- it will only lead to your inevitable disappointment. Blizzard needs to review the already overwhelmingly negative reviews from its users. Overwatch 2 was supposed to already have PvE. Overwatch 2 was supposed to already have access to new characters without them being hidden behind battle passes. Overwatch 2 was supposed to be an upgrade from Overwatch 1, and though some decent changes were made, I'd prefer Overwatch 1 any day; I think it's obvious most players would agree.Blizzard, get your sh*t together. People are tired of your broken promises. Learn from this - If not for your current patrons, then for your potential future ones."
ouseVen,0,August 11,4,,0,Not Recommended,"Overwatch is like seeing your superhero in action. Overwatch 2 is like meeting your superhero in real life.Never meet your heroes.The first game was something cool and in some ways even new; even though hero shooters have been out there for a long while, it had it's charm and brought people to play this game. Of course, like every game, people have been losing interest, because the same thing over and over got boring, but it still was quite enjoyable. The thrill of opening a lootbox after levelling up, playing new modes with innovative mechanics, mixing up ultimate abilities to create crazy combinations; it was fun.The first game died so much that devs became desperate enough that they announced a second game with a promise of PvE, which everyone found exciting, because the missions presented to that time were fun to play. So, they closed the first game and launched the second.The PvE was, of course, delayed which was okay, because we were getting new content at the time. There was hype for the new release, but soon after; I can vouch for the word: immediatelly people noticed that it's the same thing. Same mechanics, same playstyles, they just removed 2 slots from your typical Overwatch matchmaking game and added new characters. Not only that, but devs also decided to put everything and I mean everything that was free behind a paywall; characters, charms, lootboxes, skins. You name it. You practically can't get anything new without spending real money for this game. They replaced beloved by community free lootboxes with a pathetic battlepass. Their excuse is that the mythic skin (the last reward you get) takes ""very long"" to make. Which is understandable, but it's only one skin for one character, nothing else. They've added nothing that was worth of people's interest. They ruined the balance of the game by removing stuns, nerfing the existing characters and adding incredibly powerful characters behind, would you guess it? A paywall or a lot of hours of grind. Nevertheless people who pay have the advantage. Worst part? They've broken their promises, cancelled the only thing that people were hyped for and now Overwatch (2) became a poor excuse of a cash grab game."

myta,0,August 11,3,,6,Not Recommended,"This review will mainly be about the PVE, because the PVP deserves a seperate one. If your explanation for these overwhelmingly negative reviews is that we, gamers, are ""Toxic"", then you are completely missing the point. The game is but a shell of what it used to be. The PVE missions are unpolished, have low content, lack any replay-ability, and moreover: It's not even close to what they promised and I'm not only talking about the cancelled Hero mode when I say that.An amazing well polished coop experience that is challenging, fun, and engaging at the same time? That requires you not to abuse your developers/employees. You can see the devs had passion and vision, but that doesn't matter anymore nowadays. Because corporate greed and misconduct on the work floor taints everything. Missions; Cinematic are great, voice acting is great, animations are great, character interactions are great, story is nice. Gameplay? Too little of it and that which is there is mediocre.The AI is dumb and has very little player interaction. Difficulty is inflated by adding more health and damage. That's it. Elite enemy? More health, more dmg, still dumb. Play on higher difficulty level? Same thing. Nothing changes. AI doesn't get smarter and interactive, spawns are the same, there's just no love given to it. The Event mission has you grab heavy batteries that disable movement abilities and slow you down a ton, they're also quite a bit away from the objective so you have to overextend a bit to get them. However, no enemies get aggrod when you pick them up, there is just one of them you gotta kill in order to obtain it. Why not just spawn a wave of enemies so your entire team has to protect the VIP?I remember in the Archives Storm Rising missions, day 1, when playing on legendary the spawns were actually well thought out and encouraged tactical and cooperative play. But then they reworked the mission on day 2, and that is when well thought out coop was replaced with artificial difficulty inflation. Big enemy, big health, big damage, just peak for a few seconds to damage them and repeat infinitely until they die. Braindead gameplay, that invalidated our day 1 victory, as it spawned less enemies too.These reviews have a bandwagon, yes, but you can't just ignore reality. Gamers are toxic indeed, but that is not a valid argument here. That is not why we are outraged about how Overwatch 2 and 95% of all other AAA games have been soulless money making machines (not you Doom Eternal, Elden Ring and more <3).I'm sorry devs, you are amazing, it must hurt for you to see all this happen.I get why Jeff left, I hope he and all others that left are well <3"

Grizz,0,August 10,3,,0,Recommended,"As much as it is a really good game and most hatred is towards Blizzard I think there is also a few, like me, that dislike towards it because the things that they have changed from Overwatch 1 over to 2. One example being that they have removed loot boxes, which were easy to get in 1, and basically replaced it with a battle pass that makes people have to buy it for more cosmetics and to play the new hero each season early. I do however like the new season with hero progression, however they are still wanting us to pay with the new story missions even if everything else is free to play.Overall I do think I play the game more now then whenever I played Overwatch 1 so I will have to give some kudos for that. I do miss the capture points though :["
Zombiefish1,0,August 10,3,,16,Not Recommended,"Pretty fun game, however it has a lot of issues and it has absolutely awful management from blizzard:- New game modes are ok, but nothing to really make me excited for.- Matchmaking is pretty slow, but games are still usually one sided.- OW2 removed a lot of basic features from OW1 which are now being added back as ""updates"".- The f2p model is just really bad, skins are awfully overpriced and old OW1 skins take an entire season to earn compared to a couple of levels in OW1.- The game having heroes being unlocked halfway in the BP (unless you pay for the premium version) feels quite unfair and almost ""pay2win"" in a hero shooter which has a massive emphasis on counter picking.- Seasonal events are usually boring and honestly feel less interesting/fun than the OW1 events (cough Starwatch).- The PvE that was promised (and was the entire reason OW1 turned into OW2) is actually 3 missions for £15, without any skill-trees or replay value.Honestly OW2 just feels like a worse version of OW1 in almost every single way, especially since the PvE feels like a cop-out (the main thing everyone was looking forward to was just removed because blizzard higher-ups realised they can make money from £40 skin bundles instead of actual game content). It really sucks since there is a really fun core game, but i just cant recommend it to anyone."

TheMadMaximum,0,August 12,26,,0,Not Recommended,"The game is solid. You should however buy nothing if ya want to play. The new pve event is not worth buying nor are any of the over priced skins. The game developers aren't trustworthy as they will just lie about things(probably Bobby's fault and not theirs but it does them no favors). The only thing that is good value is the battle pass but it's not worth giving the company any money plus if you buy the pass, you are kinda then stuck and obligated to complete the pass before it disappears at the end of the season or you've wasted money. I've been around since Overwatch 1 and the game is basically just a different version of that original game. This version basically wasted and lost any potential it had and is honestly now just a fun/soulless shell of what it once was. Play it if you want to as it has a hero shooter experience that can't be found anywhere else but seriously, do not buy anything or trust that they care about their players."

DudeTheJesus,0,August 11,3,,0,Not Recommended,"TL;DR — a messy game that has it’s moments but ultimately isn’t worth your time due to ActiBlizz's incompetent management that led to inhumane working conditions, horrendous monetization, broken promises and disappointingly shallow & tone-deaf narrative.It’s insane to see a Blizzard game in Steam, and hopefully I’m gonna be one of reasons they’ll regret it (lol) because I’m about to tear this game a new one. Don’t mind the low playtime count — I’ve been playing OW for 760 hours since the release, it’s my second most-played game. So when you see me critisizing the hell out of this game, it’s not because I simply dislike it, but because I have a very personal connection with it, and there was a time when I not just liked, but loved this game.- MonetizationThe second-worst part of this game. OW1 popularized lootboxes, and while they are 100% bad, they nowhere near as bad as the battle-pass system OW2 uses. First, Blizzard preys on the famous Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), and does so in a VERY stingy way, where without paying you get only the most bottom-tier items imaginable. In OW1 you bought the game, and while it was definitely incentivising buying lootboxes, you could get what you wanted without them — sometimes it felt grindy, and that sucked, but now we’ve got something much worse. In OW2 you buy battle-pass and get what the game gives you, with very little chance to beeline towards what you actually want, especially since skins are now sky-high expensive. This game was not made to be playable — it was made to be profitable, and that’s a disgusting &  exploitative way to develop games.— StoryTHE reason I personally have so much beef with this game. OW had a huge potential when it comes to lore, story and characters — but it was always spoon-fed to us at rate so slow everyone except for the most devoted fans have long burned out and stopped caring, even for that animated series Blizzard released recently — something we would’ve gone insane for 5 years ago! But instead we’ve spend many years waiting for a story to just get out of the “first chapter” phase! And those years were filled with nothing but neglect for both worldbuilding & characters, to the point where waiting for Zenyatta content was considered more a meme than reality.— RepresentationOW is very prideful (pun intended) in how progressive it is, while doing less the absolute bare minimum in this department. It took six years for them to add a black woman! And considering the next thing I’m going to discuss, their talk about respecting minorities is exactly that — just shallow talk to appear progressive without actually understanding what it means and which standards should they uphold themselves to.— Just awful peopleIf you were wondering, what’s the worst thing about the game — it’s the executives at Activision-Blizzard. There was a pretty long period where you couldn’t spend a day withough learning some awful new thing about them. Sexism, racism, frat bro culture that’s so toxic a woman committed suicide, STEALING HUMAN MILK FROM FRIDGES (YES FOR REAL) and the unpleasant implications Blizzard creates in their writing of omnics and human-omnic conflicts in OW lore, culminating in releasing OW2 trailer where Brave Policemen fights Those Omnics who are fighting for their rights But In A Bad Way, all that amongst HongKong-Blitzchung scandal (which is a whole another can of worms). Activision, Blizzard and specifically Overwatch team are not ruled by good people, and that directly affects both human lives and the quality of the games they’re making. Hey remember when they justified OW2 by announcing a full-fledged PvE campaign and then scrapped it? Because I do.~ GameplayI’m a game-designer myself so it’s usually easy for me to understand why I dislike certain games. However with OW I’m having a rough time to decipher the specifics, so apologies in advance if I’m talking out of my ass. Anyway: in my opinion OW, while has it’s moments, is a giant on clay feet, aka a good game with shaky foundations. A good online-game can last without new content for a long time, just look at TF2. Overwatch? I’m shocked it lasted as long as it did, with the whole Waiting-For-OW2 hiatus thing. The game feels restrictive — every time players find an unintended way to have fun, it gets cut immediately, at best being available only in custom games (and don’t even start me on the balance — OW is a perfect example of a game that is way too overbalanced). And even those custom games feel like a piece of what we truly needed — a game editor. Some game only as good as the freedom they provide to the player, and OW is, sadly, barely provides it. But hey, at least some characters are really nice to play — I love Zenyatta, he’s just one of those characters that feels AMAZING when you’re good at playing him. Over 7 years he was barelly touched by balance changes, and that says a lot. That’s probably why OW1 lasted during hiatus — even despite the whole mess Blizzard is today, some devs really, REALLY cared. And it shows. Sometimes. So let’s talk about positives, eh?+ Sound-designNow this is something for other devs to look up too. This game will never get you confused — each enemy has it’s own sounds for walking, attacking, using abilities, etc. Sound-design is clear and nice in this game — you could use this game’s sounds for ASMR if you want! I really like Bastion’s walking & shooting sounds for example. Bastion is a treasure.+ Visual styleAlso nice and sharp. The game looks good, both in terms of graphical fidelity and art-style. I dislike some things in it (especially sexualised designs, dear Lilith, how can someone feel no shame for designing Widowmaker LIKE THAT), but in genetal it works perfectly well, and creates a really unique impression. Also the animation is really good — every character is very well animated, and their animations often work as a characterization tool — Soldier-76 reloading his gun in a very brief, very professional manner, as a soldier should, while Junkrat’s custom-made gun shakes so hard it’s a miracle he’s able to hold it. However I dislike the redesigns they did in OW2 — they were simply unnecessary, especially considering how OW1 designs have became iconic to the point that even those who had zero interest in the game can recognize at least some of the characters.+ AccesibilityI both mean this as in “making the game accessible for disabled people” and “getting people into pvp and/or shooter games”. For example, OW has really good color-blind options, to the point where even I, a person with no color blindness, use it, to make the game easier for my eyes, and they also have subtitles — which is, sadly, quite a lot by the standards of PVP-shooters. And this game introduced A LOT of people to the genre of PvP-shooters and shooters in general, which is always appreciated. It takes a special skill to make a gameplay that looks alluring even to people who were never interested in games of that genre before.+ OptimizationWhen you are used to online-games taking from 80 to 200 Gbs you really appreciate a game that takes only 30+. And it runs well too — my old laptop was a dated piece of junk already back in 2016, but OW was perfectly playable at 30 FPS & low settings. Idk how well OW2 plays on similar devices today, but I haven’t heard any complaints."

Now it's a shell of it's former self, it's sad that the path this game took to being on par with TF2 to being sunk into the ground, sunk by a company who's predatory actions knows no bounds, it will get you to spend more money by taking away the loot boxes which where earned through levels and no longer available to you, by adding a battle pass and locking most of the original heroes behind a $15 paywall this game isn't free to play only to those characters that are available base game. The battle pass is making this game pay to win, and most of the new characters feel and look boring to play. Anyway just doing my part to fight off this predatory route that Activison/Blizzard took to ruin this game and destroy what little player base they had.PS:Porn good game bad."

CuNi,0,August 13,4,,0,Not Recommended,"They took a perfectly fun game, that was even generating a good stream of money for them and turned it into a burning and stinking pile of trash.Skins are way out of line with the pricing, the bundles are awful, and you don't even get heroes for free anymore, you either have to buy the Season Pass, grind the hell out of the season pass, or grind the hell out of the game a season later to unlock the hero again.A new Hero is OP but you don't have the money to buy the season pass or the time to grind for him? Tough luck sugar cube, get used to be owned by him and not being able to play him!Overwatch 1 died for this. We were promised a PvE-Story Campaign... the whole reason Overwatch 2 came to be was the PvE-Content.. which was scrapped! Well not completely, they re-used that content, or at least the maps, for the new invasion PvE-Mode. But that one's gonna cost you 15 Bucks as a bundle and is just tiny chopped of portions of the original maps. The progression system is still completely gone.Blizzard was once known as a company that turned everything to gold that they touched.This is most likely still true, but not for gamers anymore, but for their shareholders. Diablo Immortal makes insane money and it shows. Diablo 4 got a Season Pass-System with an MTX shop and Overwatch 2 went the same way.The worst thing is, they didn't even give you a choice whether you'd like to play 1 or 2.. the original game is just gone, banished from existence and we're stuck with this sorry excuse of an attempt to just produce even more revenue with even less workforce."

The first inkling of change came with the pve and its nothing more than archives but $15, why spend 15 on this ass game when you can use it for gas.  helpless money grab they unfortunately brought over to steam. many things promised they just take back a month away from when its supposed to release. Its baffling to me how a game that had me hooked just a few years ago has turned into immediate disappointment and regret after just one game or waiting the 5-10 minutes for a queue ""why am i playing this"" and getting off. It was so close to making a come back and after each season it became more obvious they do not care about the  game or the community. They do what they want and get surprised when the public reviews it negatively, then proceed to change something completely out of their asses for the fun of it. this weeks patch notes had a 0.1 difference on projectile size (was 0) on ana, in what way is that a change.

DalboArt,0,August 14,4,,14,Not Recommended,"Having around 900 hours in this game, playing it since 2016, I can say that nowadays overwatch is a shadow of what it used to be, and I can't apreciate it for what it is now.Regardless of how you feel about how Keplan's direction with the game, starving it of content for 3 years, that was better then what it is now. If you want to have any in game reward for playing this game, you must get through a paywall every two months, otherwise, you are getting crumbs. You can thank the microtransaction-paying-whales for that. Alternatively you can work yourself to the bone playing this game like it's a resposability, in order to get the battle pass for free after 3 seasons (5 months total) every week. Which is what I did since it's launch. Some of it I regreat it, some I don't.Put that in perspective with the old model where we could get the skins we wanted for free, just by playing.The gameplay is still good, for what it's worth. It's what kept many of us playing it during the 'dark days of no-contentness' after all. It's still a better team-based shooter with powers, ultimates and what-a-not than what you get from games of the same genre in that regard.The beggining of Overwatch was something special. I am sorry if you missed out."

Diplopia,0,August 30,4,,2,Not Recommended,"In the realm of digital entertainment, where innovation and immersion flourish, Overwatch emerges as a perplexing enigma that both tantalizes and ultimately disappoints. Nestled within its vibrant facade lies a litany of missed opportunities and a pervasive sense of unfulfilled potential.One is immediately struck by Overwatch's visually arresting design, a mesmerizing tapestry woven from a palette of vivid colors and intricate character designs. Yet, as the allure of its aesthetic charm settles, the enchantment wanes under the weight of repetitive gameplay dynamics. The essence of innovation feels diluted as the core mechanics remain tethered to time-worn tropes, rendering matches as a monotonous rhythm rather than a symphony of strategic diversity.Regrettably, the narrative landscape within Overwatch is a barren terrain, devoid of the profound storytelling depth that contemporary gaming enthusiasts have come to anticipate. The game introduces a promising array of characters, each with their own hints of intrigue, only to consign them to mere two-dimensional archetypes. With the rich potential for immersive lore and interconnected narratives, the game's narrative shortcomings constitute a glaring misstep.The allure of multiplayer engagement within Overwatch is undeniably powerful, fostering a sense of camaraderie and competition. However, the experience is marred by a perplexing dearth of meaningful progression. The ephemeral thrill of winning a match fails to find resonance in a progression system that feels arbitrary, lacking the satisfying crescendo of accomplishment that distinguishes titles of this genre.Beyond its intrinsic flaws, Overwatch is overshadowed by a culture of toxicity that has permeated its player base. What could have been an arena for mutual admiration and spirited competition has descended into a breeding ground for vitriol and incivility. The developers' ostensibly well-intentioned efforts to balance the game frequently feel like belated remedies rather than proactive solutions, further exacerbating the prevailing sense of frustration.In conclusion, Overwatch stands as a testament to untapped potential and missed opportunities. The allure of its entrancing visuals and initial gameplay charm belie a deeper reality of stagnation, repetitiveness, and narrative shallowness. It is a somber reminder of the pitfalls that await when creativity and innovation are stifled by adherence to convention. The echoes of Overwatch's potential serve as both a cautionary tale and a lament for what could have been."

The Pie God,0,August 11,13,,0,Not Recommended,"Even ignoring all the glaring problems Blizzard as a company has, Overwatch 2 is an unfocused mess of content, with a terrible battle pass that somehow makes loot boxes look like a better alternative. The developers can't seem to do anything right, and can't even properly release a campaign that's been in the works for four years.And honestly, it's really not even that fun."

Astraea,0,August 22,6,,0,Not Recommended,"Hooooo boy. Okay.I've played this game for many hours under the blizzard launcher, and I played the hell out of Overwatch 1.Please don't spend money on this game. They removed Overwatch 1 (a product I bought) and replaced it with the free-to-play Overwatch 2.Changes- 6v6 turned into 5v5 with a single souped-up tank- new heroes are no longer automatically available to everyone. Either pay up to access, or get ridiculously far in the free battle pass. This game is built around counter-picking heroes, so they've gone into pay-to-win territory- You used to get a lootbox for every level you earned, and seasonal events added seasonal items to the lootboxes. This meant that if you played the game a lot, you would get access to most customizable hero content. Now they barely give anything for free- In place of lootboxes, now you can buy things directly from a shop. Prices of new skins are around $30. Think I saw a bundle of 2 skins for $50- Graphics upgrade- Day/Night lighting for maps- Small hero balance tweaks- Removed some maps- Added some maps with a new game objective typeFrankly, there's not enough in that list to justify this being a sequel to the game. They cynically did this to force people to use their shop. They TOLD us the sequel was justified with all of the PvE content they were going to do, and they were just releasing it early, temporarily without the PvE content. Months later and we find out that the PvE content was cut, and replaced with a hollow simulacrum of what was promised. Blizzard is always looking to make a buck, even through unethical means. They've lost their soul to greed. The company that made fun games, that put the player first, is no more."

Nexo,0,August 13,3,,65,Not Recommended,"Overwatch 2 is nothing. The game doesn't bring any emotions whatsoever anymore. There is no sense of progression, the ranked games you get are never equally balanced, you either stomp or get stomped.The balance patches are too infrequent for a game like Overwatch.Lastly, coming from a tank player - the replacement of 6v6 for a 5v5 model made this game so much worse it's incredible. 70% of joy coming from playing tank was the synergy between the 2 tanks. Now I feel like every ranked game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of counterpicking, you want to play junkerqueen? Some dork will pick orisa or zarya, you want to play rein? Some other dork will also pick orisa or ball or whatever to just make you miserable and leave you not wanting to open the game ever again.Don't get me wrong, this game still has so much unused potential, maybe one day they will bring back the old ranked system along with 6v6, I've always liked overwatch for the originality, never have I seen a game which requires 12 players for a match, but I loved it and I spent countless hours in that game, please don't waste overwatch, it doesn't deserve it."

The Parlangua,0,August 12,3,,0,Not Recommended,"I remember being down on Overwatch ""2"" when it was announced, this game looks no different, am I missing something? Oh there will be a full PvE campaign, like a true single player or co-op experience, but does that warrant another game entirely? I must admit I was pretty narrow minded back then and have to admit my faults when they come to light, Overwatch 2 is not the exact same as Overwatch 1, I was silly to think so and have done some reflection in my time playing the game since launch. Overwatch 2 is nothing like the Overwatch I bought in 2016 and loved, it is entirely, fundamentally, worse. Higher up devs were so busy stealing coworker's breast milk and sexually assaulting interns they let so many absolutely mind bogglingly bad patches and gameplay changes through the door I hesitate to even call it ""development"" anymore, this is more like demolition. LMAO nice c9 Blizzard, you had the game won and got off the point by releasing this ""sequel""."
Spoonerang,0,August 12,3,,23,Not Recommended,"Game as a game is fine, plays well. Enjoy the free game, however I can't recommend giving Blizzard any money. This ""sequel"" is just an update to gameplay that the community had to wait about 3 years for as well as a major downgrade as far as everything else is concerned. Overwatch ""1"" was deleted in the process so earning the past cosmetics (from OW1) is a slow grind that probably isn't worth it, as they encourage you to spend money to skip the newly added grind. Game is ultimately a disappointment and doesn't deliver what it promised to do as a sequel. I used to joke and say it was a glorified expansion in the early announcement days of Overwatch 2 (showing off the campaign content and etc) which I guess would have been accurate but now it doesn't even feel like a glorified update, it's more like a downgrade across the board, with decent 5v5 gameplay. There's still fun to be had with it, sure, but it's tough love especially for early supporters and fans of the game. We deserved better."

She'll even eat your ass and every fetish you're into? She's into it too. She's so fine that the things she lets you do to her almost make you feel guilty.  BUT she's CONSTANTLY hitting you up for coke money and she won't shut up about coke it's all she talks about and it's driving you to the edge of sanity. She goes through hundreds of lines of coke a day. When you met she was a good girl, so sweet and fun. She was the whole package and she promised you that she would help you raise a family. Then her parents died and she was never the same. Yeah every time y'all BONE she comes up with some new wild thing that blows your mind but SHE'S GONNA ASK FOR COKE MONEY 5 MINUTES AFTER YOU'RE DONE. If you don't give it to her she hits you on top of everything. But you keep coming back don't you, you sick ♥♥♥♥? You filthy piece of ♥♥♥♥. Instead of just moving on you keep finding yourself balls deep inside her and when you're done that wave of regret washes over you like fetid dish water. Do yourself a favor and never give her coke money again. Yeah she'll probably end up dead on the side of the road somewhere or find another idiot paypig but at least you have your self respect. Sure keep laying pipe on her, keep slinging the salami, she's good at it and surprisingly faithful. Hell even gaslight her into thinking you're gonna give her money and then don't do it just for the free ass. But NEVER GIVE HER MONEY AGAIN. Stay strong kings and queens. For the ladies I guess imagine a guy with a 10 pound dong or something that looks like a Greek god. This is the only time I wish I could take a game OFF of Steam. If they come out with a skin that makes me betray myself, if I know that at least Steam is making money on these MACROTRANSACTIONS then I'll have that peace of mind that Blizzard is at least losing some money by putting it on here but I don't know if that's true.

Shizar,0,August 11,3,,0,Not Recommended,"I have been playing Overwatch ever since it's first halloween event and I had the displeasure to see what was once one of my fav games to play slowly be butchered and turned into a shallow cash grab that stop prioritizing the fun of the player and instead it prioritisez figuring out what other gameplay feature they can lock behind a paywall. I've seen the game that once had a vision get destroyed by bad balancing,awul hero design,0 care from the devs by reusing the same events over and over again barely changing anything. And Overwatch 2 was ment to be the game that fixed it all and gave us back the amazing game we all played and enjoy,however that didn't happen. Instead the game felt like it took away stuff from the player with no real reason. It locked away heroes in a game that was design with counter picking in mind,it took away loot boxes that gave us a reason to play,something to look forward to to get,it wasn't much but hell it was something. But now I can play several matches and get nothing from it. Yeah there is a battlapass and yes there is SOME free stuff in it but the grind to get any of it is way higher than getting 1 singular loot box. But Overwatch 2 died for me when they announced PVE was officially out of the picture since that went against what this game was ment to be. Jeff Keplan himself said that he wanted overwatch 2 to be STRICLY a PVE expirience( Source for what I said[www.dexerto.com]) and as a way to move the story more forward,however as I said that was not what happen and this is probably why he left the company. Now even the PVE content which is what I was most hyped for is now just another cash grab. 15$ for 3 missions with very little replayability. And for anyone that will look at my profile and see that I played tf2 and will try to somehow use that as an argument against me let me make it clear that I was never into the whole Overwatch vs TF2 argument. Hell I wanted overwatch to be BETTER than tf2 and there was a time I preferd this game over tf2. But one game has plummeted into infamy as a cash grab ran by people that can't decide if they wanna harass my wallet or the poor girl employees while the other still having it's issues is looked at with fond memories as a classic and staple of the class based genre and it's still going strong after 16 years."

GankAlpaca,1,August 11,3,,0,Not Recommended,"Pros+ Now on steam+ Accessibility options for people with colorblindess (not as customisable right now), motion sickness and poor eyesight+ Support of more aspect ratios added back Cons- The release of ow2 was just a marketing move. They didn't release any new characters during ow1 to then release 3 character at ones with ow2 to create a feeling of something productive being done while it was just postponing the release of characters.- Free to play is not an advantage but rather a solution to the game being bad and people leaving. Ow1 had never been having problems with online while the game had good balancing and content.-Cosmetic item prices. Legendary skins that you could get in like 2 weeks of passive playing or randomly from a FREE lootbox now cost 20$ each and furthermore you now are only able to buy some on specific days due to introduction of the shop. -The game tries to trick you into spending more money out of lack of knowledge of the buying system or from being clumsy. It is easy to buy something accidentally or buy useless stuff in a bundle thinking you can't buy it independently. -The prices. It is less costly to buy a real keychain charm in real life than it is to buy the same charm in game.-HUD. HUD quality has fallen significantly. It is a change just for the purpose of existing and not solving anything.  1. The main menu was changed and now it is weirdly spaced and some buttons were moved to Escape menu which now makes you press extra buttons if you want access something quickly.  2. Escape menu is now not transparent. This makes it hard now to change some setting if you are in a middle of a game since you can't now see what is around you. Some people may prefer opaque menu due to motionsickness and I understand that but why not just make it a toggle option then? 3. The option to adjust HUD borders is hidden inside game's config which can cause trouble for some people with old displays or non 16:9 aspect ratio users. 4. Useless details being added to the first person ui like transparent lines in the corners of the screen. There is nothing wrond visually but again it's just a change for a change. It adds nothing just obscures your vision in the corners and makes the ui look weird when you adjust screen borders leaving you with floating sharp hud parts.-Matchmaking and game modes. Quickplay is just a worse ranked. Quickplay has a SBMM system which uses hidden mmr to match people. This makes quickplay more competetive. You can get a similiar feeling of what sbmm is from games like DBD or COD MWII. Moreover there are weekly challenges that require you to win in quickplay and other non-competetive modes to get crumbs of shop currency thus resulting in sweaty games in chill modes. Quickplay doesn't even have rewards of the ranked mode.I'm too lazy to continue with the cons of the game so I will just end it here. Don't spend a dime on the game unless things get better."

Ikolo,0,August 12,5,,0,Not Recommended,"TLDR: No, don't play this game.In 2019, Activision Blizzard began slowing down the frequency of updates and patches in order to focus on a new endeavor for the game. The last major patch for the game was on April 14, 2020, with the addition of the then newest (and last) hero in Echo, 8 months after the latest hero, Sigma. Overwatch got its last official update on June 16, 2020, where the game then sat on Blizzard's shelf, collecting dust as they began working on a shiny new version of the game in Overwatch 2, with an attempt to add in potentially a very strong, very dedicated PVE version of the game, complete with hero missions, hero talents, and a replayable, story driven game mode. This was not something seen from no where, on November 1, 2019, Overwatch 2 was announced, which is why people initially expected, and for the first while, may have accepted the slow down of Overwatch 1's updates and patches. Little did the community know, that it would essentially be killed off in order to focus more development on Overwatch 2 and it's PvE elements. After two years of little to no updates for the game, the community became vocal, angry, and unhappy with ActivisonBlizzard's lack of updates to a still live, still active game, with no true signs of progress of the upcoming, and highly anticipated 2 that was being slapped on the back end of an already established and successful game.With numbers dropping and interest waning, ActivisionBlizzard made a bold decision to finally release Overwatch 2's brand new, never removed from box, PvP version, in an attempt to sate the community that was picking up its torches and pitchforks. This was a successful attempt, a transition to 5v5, a new coat of paint on a pretty well liked game, new heroes, new maps, new game mode, but more importantly, actual content updates. People began putting down their medieval riot equipment (a good chunk of them anyway), and sat down to re-enjoy a game they've long been waiting to see some progress for. Things were okay, but people were still foaming at the mouth for the highly hyped and overly promised (we'll get to that) PvP element that would justify the 2 in Overwatch 2. Updates? Few. Progress? Seemingly null (sector, heh). Anticipation, still growing. Then finally, after years of waiting, salivating, and chomping at the bit for PvE news, we were given a big announcement in May in regards to the long overdue PvE mode for Overwatch 2. That announcement? We're not getting it anymore. For that brief period that the community was pacified with new content, during which time people were hit with paywalls for new heroes, hit with overpriced skins, hero breaking bugs and glitches that would take a week or more to fix, but with a shop that was fixed within hours of going down (let's you know they CAN be quick). But the rage had swelled up once again, this time, with the added fury of broken promises and intentional lies spoon fed to us by ActivisionBlizzard, that by this time, the community began looking at as nothing more than a small snow cloud left behind after the winter season. How were these lies intentional? Simple, by the time the launched Overwatch 2 PvP, they seemed to have already decided that PvE would not be happening to the scale they had foretold.To some, this came as no shock, the company that had pulled one team from the prior successful game to work on its ""successor"" and then made them work on two games simultaneously, one already Walking (as by their crawl, walk, run strategy) and the other still developing on the game room floor. Made to work through an environment fraught with harassment of varying types, an abusive hierarchy within the development teams, top end leadership that seemed to ignore and potentially even encourage it all, and even through someone being driven to losing their fight with their own inner demons. To those that remained hopeful, most remaining hopes were dashed and broken. In place of the large candy store called ""endlessly replayable story missions"" that was promised, it had been replaced with a mere few hours of PvE content, very similar to what we had already been receiving, the equivalent of the gas station candy section at the checkout counter.The game typically in ebbs and flows of imbalance, overpowered characters, and occasionally actually good balance, which once had a very promising and strong start, now seems to be in its death throes, as the community once again has risen up, spewed their hatred for the course this IP has taken via deceit and heavy monetization. Would I recommend this game? No. If you play, I do hope you enjoy the game, because games are meant to be enjoyed, so I sincerely hope you find fun in it, but seeing where this game has gone after playing it almost since its initial launch in 2016, I cant find the fun in this game anymore, and I'd highly recommend looking for something else. I hope the game and the community that is still active there treats you well. At least you know through all the chaos, the in-game store will always be at peak performance."

Jeff Kaplan leaving the company before the release of PvE.... until they said it to our faces in a stream it was entirely cancelled (The road map was only there to let us down easily to show us they got something cooked up.... but I assure you, past season 6 they have no plans what to do in the future lol)This is why this game deserves the reception its getting at... They promised us a good game with great features and highly replayable missions only for that original vision to be scrapped and its remains sold to us for $15 (and thats only for the first 3 missions, I would've gladly paid $60 to play the 3 missions with my friends if the talent was added)... Dont even get me started about features from Ow1 being added back and they're hyping it up like its a positive thing (Which shouldve been there from the start lmao)sad thing this game started out strong but due to greedy higher ups and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ upper management its lesser competition at the time like Paladins outlived this game lol (Tf2 still reigns supreme)"

raidebaron,0,August 14,4,,28,Not Recommended,"How to say it... Overwatch 2 is a disappointment.Back in 2016, this game, formally known as Overwatch, was a breath of fresh air in an industry that had grown stagnant, who kept on relying on DLCs that were splitting the playerbase for every bit on content. While it was retailed at $40 ($60 for it's ""Origins Edition""), Overwatch gave access to a plethora of great heroes to play, varied in their unique design, gameplay and personality. You also had the possibility to customize your hero with a selection of detailed skins, all of free (but you had to depend on luck thanks to the game's lootbox system), you could also buy said lootboxes, which quickly could go awry if left uncheked with player's addiction, and of course it all was made by design to squeeze out the money out of their players. But we didn't complain as much as today's system because there was a way to get all of the cosmetic items for free, you simply had to play the game. If you had duplicate items in your lootbox, they were converted into coins to eventually allow you to get the items you wanted. While it was an imperfect system, it certainly was fairer than the economic system in place today.But Overwatch 2's core was shaken by the departure of Jeff Kaplan, the former director of Overwatch. And came crumbling down to the whims of the Corporate wind. And it was rebuilt on a foundation of Deceit.Of Lies.Of Greed.Back in 2019, just a few months before the world went down the drainer with the Covid-19 Pandemic, it was announced at BlizzCon that the game would recieved a sequel simply titled ""Overwatch 2"". With a newly upgraded engine to boot, Overwatch 2 would have something that players have been clamering the developpers about for years.A actual campaign. A bigger, bolder and more ambitious PVE mode that what was available with the Archives Event at the time.While it was unclear at the time how this PVE campaign would be implemented within the game, it had bold claims such as ""Highly Replayable CO-OP"", ""Level Up Your Heroes"" and ""Customize Your Abilities"". We were promised a deep gameplay to allow us to customize our heroes abilities, and not just how much they hurt Null Sector's omnic goons, but how the abilities work.You could have had Tracer's Pulse bomb explosion spread amonst all enemies in a chain reaction.You could have had Mei turn into a snowball to crush her opponents.You could have had Genji shoot out cutting light circles with his katana.You could have had Reinhardt perform a 360° Earthshatter all around him.And more...But in late 2022, Overwatch 2 finally comes out on Battle.net (Blizzard's proprietary launcher), and consoles. And players the world over comes to understand how much the game has changed... for the worse.You're a new player and you don't have the old heroes? Either pay up for the Hero Bundle, or play 150 games to unlock all previous heroes up to Echo (Excluding the newer ones: Kiriko/Sojourn/Junker Queen/Ramattra/Lifeweaver/Illari and all future ones).You want to play the newest hero? Either pay up for the Battle Pass to unlock them instantly, or grind half of it to unlock the latest hero.You skipped a season in which there was a new hero? Either pay up to unlock them, or grind some challenges in the Practice Range and win 35 games in All Roles queue or playing that hero's role in ""Quick Play"", ""Competitive Play"", or ""No Limits"" (and don't forget to activate that challenge, or it will not count towards it. And you cannot cumulate between two locked new heroes).Don't have a phone plan? You're out of luck because you can't play the game, now. ""Blame the cheaters, smurfers, and toxic players"", they will tell you.You are no longer a player to them. You are only a living wallet to them.Your concerns mean nothing to them. Only your credit card has worth to them.Your critisms are falling on deaf's ear. Only what they want to hear is feedback to them.I want to hope that things will change for the better, I want to keep on supporting it but the reality is the following: I do not expect anything to change. I do not expect them to reconsider, or change their business model.I do not expect them to stop locking out the newest heroes behind their Battle Pass.I do not expect them to offer those who actually buy and grind their Battle Pass some ""Overwatch Coins"" (their premium currency) like most of their concurrents Battle Passes do, like in Fortnite.I do not expect them to treat their players, and more importantly, their employees with the respect and decency they deserve.I do not have hope that they will wake up from this nightmare, and stop spitting on their golden legacy like they've done with Warcraft 3: Reforged.I do not have hope for this game. Nor this franchise, or the company at large.Perhaps when Microsoft finally closes on acquiring Activision/Blizzard, things will be changing for the better but I'm already disillusioned to hope that it will happen.""Overwatch was shut down for a reason. It's time to move on."""

Diablo 4 is a Horrible Mess and Overwatch 2 is as well. Greedy all around.I suggest you play Team Fortress 2, ExoPrimals, or even Paladins If you want a Fun Similar Game to play. It may not be Pretty or Glamorous but it's better than Overwatch. TLDR; Do not play this game, you earn nothing but is expected to pay for all of your content.

Excaliux,0,August 11,4,,0,Not Recommended,"I loved Overwatch. It was at one point my favorite FPS game back in the day. Before I quit OW1 due to the game not getting updates, I reached mid diamond and was a Tank main. (Reinhardt and Roadhog) Overwatch 2 feels like a downgrade compared to Overwatch 1. Overwatch 1 wasn't perfect by any means. At the very least, OW1 whether having good and bad games felt rewarding. OW2 however made the issues that were in OW1 much worse. This series has been ruined for me. As much as I would love to see the game succeed. Blizzards stubbornness and desperate greed will be their downfall and it makes me sad.Overwatch 2 has: -Fun but also horribly balanced gameplay-Competitive is hardly functional, the last time I played, I ran into players that were 3 competitive ranks below or above me.-Competitive toxicity is extremely prevalent in the community, especially racial and discriminatory slurs that don't get addressed. Yet people can get banned for simply saying the F bomb. Potentially really biased reporting system. -Gatekeep heroes behind a battlepass that hardly rewards you for completing it, Causing FOMO. The Battle pass is awful. Especially the free pass.-Stupidly overpriced skins. Blizzard was once a more generous company. Now they're greedy and desperate, especially due to allegations and lawsuits (which they 100% deserve). I understand wanting to make money, but how do you go from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to a legendary skin being over 20 dollars. Skins should be priced so much lower.-The Developers maybe listen to 20% of what the community wants and the other 80% is spitting in the faces over everyone who loves Overwatch. So many people spoke out against issues, especially the overpriced skins to just be ignored.-Worse events (For crying out loud, they gave a Winged Victory Mercy skin that was once free in OW1 AS AN EVENT REWARD and their current events ADVERTISE THEIR OVERPRICED SKINS)-They cancelled the indepth PvE... Yknow, the whole point of being a SEQUEL??? The snippets they have left CHARGE YOU 40 DOLLARS FOR 3 MISSIONS. I can play Elden Ring and have so much more hours of gameplay than like maybe 2 hours of gameplay at most with OW2. -There is no feeling of progression anymore, which OW1 had. They shove the stupid battle pass in your face. (Levels and the border changing when you reach a certain amount of levels)In conclusion: OW2 while being a fun experience, was much more fun when it was OW1. Do yourself a favor and play another game. Don't get yourself into this game, it's not worth it. If you want good FPS games, there is better out there. It makes me sad to say this but this games negative reputation is sealed and there is no coming back from it."

Dr. 痛み™,0,August 12,5,,27,Not Recommended,"Overwatch 2 puts overpriced monetization and greed first, and player enjoyment lastI've played many hundreds of hours of Overwatch 1, ever since the game released. They made me not want to play a game I used to love and play frequently, and here's why.They replaced Overwatch 1, a game many people paid for, with Overwatch 2. In my opinion, they succeeded in fixing some aspects from OW1 that made it unfun in its latest stage of life. Since they did this and had such a great base, the game is mechanically (and in general) pretty fun. However, do not be fooled: Overwatch 2 is just the same game with a big update. They removed things people liked from the previous game and are slowly introducing them as updates, which is pathetic, it does not make sense at all.""Progression"" feels way worse, huge downgrade In the first game, you would level up (level is visible in matches, you get more eye-catching borders as you level up) and get ""lootboxes"" (each day you could easily get various of them without playing too much) very easily just by playing the game. Now, here's the thing, lootboxes granted all kinds of things: skins, profile icons, emotes, coins, etc., and keep in mind they were very easy to get, I have not payed a single cent for lootboxes and got most of the skins from the game (and there are so many). Most events were exciting mainly because of the new skins they'd release, which were really high quality and appealing.In this game, they removed levels. Now you just ""advance"" in the season pass, which is an extremely worse system than before, I'll get to why in the next part. If you don't pay, chances are high you will just get 1 or 2 things (or maybe even none) you actually want to get, after playing a hundred hours. Why the previous lootbox system was better than battle pass + item shopI know it sounds crazy for people who have not played it, but it really is like this. Anyone who played Overwatch 1 thinks this. This is because the previous system, while it was a ""chance"" to get something, you'd always get something valuable, and in case you didn't you'd eventually get coins to just go to the hero gallery and purchase whatever you wanted. So yes, even if it's a chance at getting something, it was a FAIR system, and the game did not entice you to buy lootboxes anyways. I get that Overwatch 2 is free and I'm fine with them changing this, but there are several things that make it unacceptable, which I'll explain.Overwatch 2 monetization feels more UNFAIR despite you knowing what you are getting by spending money (if you do). Overwatch? More like, Overpriced. Everything in this game is OVERPRICED. Legendary skins cost around 20€. This is NOT a fair price for a skin in a game where you don't really see the skin yourself unless you emote (it's a first-person game, you'll be just seeing the weapon most of the game). I'd rather buy a game with that money instead of some skin. So let's see: if I wanted to buy 5 new legendary skins (which are the worthier ones, besides the ""mythic""), I'd have to spend almost 100€. That's insane and really not worth it. In the past, spending 0€ you'd get many legendary skins each day and each week.Events are now meaningless because the gamemodes are not that exciting, and if they are (and some of them are indeed really fun) then they usually get old after playing a few times, so you'll just go back to the standard game. The main appeal from events and what they marketed heavily were the new skins released. In Overwatch 1 it was guaranteed you'd get at least one legendary event skin, and then chances were big enough that just by playing you'll get another one, or coins to buy another directly. Overwatch 2 made me not look forward to pretty much ANY events because I'll never buy a skin for 20€, it's so stupid.Battle pass is also not worth it: it's a much worse ""progression"" and reward system than before. It includes some free rewards which you can get by just playing, but they are sooo uninteresting most of the time, it is really not enough. You may get one or two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you pay for the battle pass (I think around 10€) then you get many rewards (they change each season), the last reward being a ""Mythic"" skin, which are skins you can customize slightly, and look much cooler. However, to get these rewards even if you paid, you still have to grind for them, and if you don't have a lot of time to play you may not even get the Mythic skin which is the worthiest reward in it always.Also, due to the nature of the game (how many different heroes it has, and you may not like or use half or more than half of them frequently), chances are VERY HIGH that the rewards on the battle pass do not appeal to you. The battle pass has this limited amount of rewards, and since you'll be frequently using half or less than half of the heroes, then you will just be interested in less than half of the rewards, which makes it not that interesting. Instead of giving you fixed rewards like a very specific skin in the battle pass, they should grant coupons (at least 2 per battle pass), that you can exchange for a skin. This would be more interesting and more fair, would make the battle pass much more valuable, and people would complain less.If they had made monetization NOT OVERPRICED, and if they basically hadn't introduced this monetization system into a game people purchased before (Overwatch 1), people would NOT be complaining like this. Every single bit of criticism is deserved.Competitive and hero unlockingThe competitive system has been one of the biggest focuses for the Overwatch devs for a long time. I won't go into too much detail, and it's been a while since I played ranked so I may be inaccurate, but it's worse in a few ways: ranks are not as visible (among players) in-game for some reason (they removed this, which makes no sense, you wanna display your rank since you are usually proud if you rank up), rank gets hidden and updated after a few matches. Matches take a while, so someone who does not have too much time to play may take like 1 or 2 days to actually see their rank change. However, this system is pretty frustrating, because you may think you're doing well these few matches and then when you reach the time to update the rank, boom, it stays the same. It feels pretty bad, such a bad system.New heroes now need to be unlocked by playing. Heroes that have just released are unlocked instantly by buying the battle pass, and can be unlocked for free by playing a lot. People can play competitive WITHOUT having unlocked certain heroes, and this is a HUGE problem they shouldn't allow. Overwatch is a game where switching in the middle of the match and counter-picking is very important. While most of the new heroes so far are not essential, having a Kiriko against an Ana gives you an advantage, since her grenade gets rid of the flask effect. Therefore, playing competitive in a team that does not have a Kiriko unlocked would put this team in a disadvantage. These are the kind of situations that can happen with this new forced greedy unlock system, that is put into place by rotten higher-ups who prioritize squeezing money out of their customers instead of actually making the game fair and good.ConclusionThere are many other problems I haven't mentioned. I still find Overwatch fun in its core gameplay, and I really wish things changed for the better. Sadly, the way the game currently is makes me, and many players, not want to play it. Competitive feels frustrating and like a chore. Getting anything is grindy at best and does not feel rewarding enough. Gotta pay (too much) for almost everything. Not enough enticing content released. I may just play a few matches to remember old times with friends of mine, and then I may drop the game forever. Such a shame. Goodbye, Overwatch."

Salvage,1,August 11,8,,0,Not Recommended,"Overwatch was such an amazing game, definitely on the path to becoming an all-time classic.They killed it to release the first ever sequel that does nothing but actively remove features from the game.Incredibly predatory monetization that fundamentally goes against some of the core design concepts of the game (counterpicking).The single promised feature with any relevance cancelled, because it wouldn't have made enough money.The competitive ranking system made completely unrewarding.I applaud the people responsible for their ability to completely suck the soul out of a game that originally had so much of it. They genuinely succeeded in making the game completely unenjoyable to play."

oracle,0,August 13,33,,13,Not Recommended,"I don't think I've ever seen a bigger fall from grace than Overwatch. I put well over 1000 hours into the original Overwatch, and seeing what the game would eventually become, I'm somewhat ashamed of that now.Before this is labeled as ""just another Overwatch 2 hate review,"" let me say that the gameplay is very nice. 5v5 plays way smoother than 6v6, and it genuinely feels like your picks matter now. However, good gameplay does NOT validate everything else about this game. I could go on for DAYS about how Blizzard took a game we payed upwards of 40 dollars for away from us, make it free-to-play, take everything we once received for free just by owning the game and lock it behind 20 dollar paywalls, I could talk about the three year development cycle this game had, just for Blizzard to scrap everything and feed us Overwatch 1.5. I could talk about the broken promises, the lies, the unspeakable acts that happen regularly at Blizzard. I could mention the shop, and how on paper it's a much better idea than lootboxes, the idea of buying a skin you want instead of gambling for it is amazing, but Blizzard sells recolors of the basic hero skins for upwards of eight dollars. You just added a form of levels to the game (which we used to have levels anyway but yeah remove something that had no harm on gameplay), why not let us earn currency by increasing that level? It doesn't even have to be every level, just as milestones or something.The point I'm trying to make is that the game itself isn't bad, everything surrounding this game gives it a very negative aura that sadly is deserved. I don't think any person who was a fan of Overwatch wanted Overwatch 2 to fail, but when it comes to disappointing their playerbase, Blizzard never disappoints. I can't even play this game without being reminded of what it used to be. I'm not acting like Overwatch 2 is where Overwatch suddenly dropped in quality, but I can safely say this is where it was made apparent. It's like they looked at the lack of content and constant recycled event modes from 2019-2022 and just said, ""What if we made the sequel all about a lack of new content?""It's honestly depressing to see how far this game has fallen."
Bluepoison,0,August 16,5,,5,Not Recommended,"Oh Blizzard... Where do I begin? Let me start of by saying, I have nearly 2k hours in Overwatch and started playing the game in late 2016. I've been through many different phases of Overwatch. I have a few main reasons why OW2 is a shadow of a game from its predecessor and it greatly saddens me that they've deleted the original game and in its place, this disgraceful want-to-be version of what used to be Overwatch. I'm certain that it's been more than thoroughly complained about when regarding the micro transactions, battle-pass model, and locked heroes and so for the sake of originality and to add some more points that I feel are worth discussing, I'm going to skip those parts. 5v5 -- but why? One of the main reasons Overwatch thrived, in my opinion, was the great need of teamwork, collaboration, creativity, and team composition. Each team was given 6 slots to fill and eventually these slots were role-based: 2 tanks, 2 dps, 2 healers. This was one of the most well-received patches (role-based queue) and bolstered the game-play. It was balanced, even, fair, and fun and offered many diverse team-comps that could be executed in any number of ways. Sure there were still ""metas"" but overall 2-2-2 was a lot of fun. In Overwatch 2 they have taken away one of the tank positions but kept the role-based game play in place (you can play a non-role-based version but it's less popular) so now it is 1-2-2. To help compensate for this, Blizzard made the tanks ""tankier"" and ""stronger"" and not to mention they moved a hero who was a DPS hero, to the tank role; though not the hero that would make much sense i.e. Doom Fist. In my opinion this is the most likely reason for the decline in popularity and reception of the game in general; removing 1 tank and creating a 5v5 game. just like every other game with team-based strategy... Overwatch was different and more fun than other similar titles due to the variety of heroes and back stories and flexibility that the game offered. By taking away one of the roles, you've in essence created a ""super role"" because the entire fate of the game is dependent upon your now only tank. Due to this, the tank role is a high-pressure, high-risk gig which requires utmost focus and attention in order to succeed in and as a team you must support your tank or lose. This is very frustrating when your tank is clearly new, trolling, or both, and creates poor game quality and in fact, most games are uneven and extremely poor quality; likely due to this reason. When it was 2-2-2 there was another tank who could help compensate for the downfall. There were synergies that could be executed and one may even argue that some tanks were only good with their counter part, such as Road Hog and Orisa. 5v5 is not fun, it's not dynamic, it's not Overwatch.  Lighting and Sound Effects When compared to OW1, the game is completely different. A different engine, different lighting, different feel, different sounds. The guns sound... like toy guns even more-so than before. The lighting in the game, while it is cool it can be adjusted from night to day on various maps, this has created confusion for me since I was so used to the maps being the same time of day. I've even gotten lost on a map I was familiar with due to this! Now this is obviously my opinion, but a fact of the new lighting system is that it is more difficult to see enemy heroes and it lost its ""Overwatch"" feeling and now feels more like a generic shooter. The gold shimmer on the guns, looks too real; what I mean by this is that the guns don't have a glowing essence about them, they are just gold. Like the plain gold you may have seen in real life, the dull and boring kind. I worked my ass off to get gold guns on many characters all to have a less flashy version... tisk.  Match MakingLast but not least we've arrived at the worst part of the game which is the match-making. Every game is either you destroying the enemy team or vice versa. There have been FAR FEWER, [i[if any[/i], intense Overtime plays, C9 moments, clutch wins/losses and the competitiveness of the game feels... off. This is in part due to the 5v5 system, but in large part, it is due to the matchmaking. Why is it as a plat player I am matched with silver players? This makes no sense and creates a horrible game experience for everyone. Every game feels like an uphill battle to either carry your team, or lose (when playing tank) and on every other hero it feels like you are a side show to the main event, the tank battles. It's so boring, static, and creates only toxic games. I can only imagine how higher tier players feel when they too get gold players in their games. It's not fun and hasn't been fixed and in fact is allowed per the tier descriptions which state that any player within 2 tiers can be in your game unless you're in masters (if I recall correctly) which is insane. This means as a gold player, as most Overwatch players are, you can have bronze players potentially in your lobby as well as silver or even as high as a diamond player. This creates a false sense of competitive game-play and leads me to only one question... What is the point of ranked if I still play matches that are nearly the same as quick play? The whole point of ranked is to compete at the highest skill level you are capable of and try to improve your personal performance, maybe it's your aim, maybe it's your style, maybe it's your communication skills; whatever it is, the point of ranked is to improve upon your own game play as much as possible and try to ascend the ladder to a higher tier. The point of ranked games is NOT to achieve fast queue times, make players feel included or special when they are in higher tier games, it is not to create imbalance which is the current state of affairs when considering ranked play. Your rank is utterly meaningless if you do not get to play with players of a similar skill level and instead play with players far above or below your skill level. Due to this, your rank truly means nearly nothing in this game unless you make it to master where you will finally have a higher degree of balance. This is not fun AT ALL.Overall, the game is not worth your time or money at this juncture. Blizzard has some serious reflection to do if they think they can keep rolling over the original fans to obtain new ones and retain that business. It is the original fans that bought the content, played the game, watched the streams, watched and helped fund the Overwatch league and it is in our faces that they now spit with this Overwatch shadow that they call Overwatch 2. I could rant on for hours on end about the mistakes and missteps made with this game, the hero balance (there is none it is balanced for pro play only), battle-pass, pay to win feeling, horrible map design, poor decision making, etc. as could many of my friends whom have also been playing since 2016 but it falls on deaf ears and closed minds. Nonetheless I hope that Blizzard can rethink its business model and the way they treat their players/fans in the future. It felt cathartic writing this out and that was my primary goal and intention. If you made it this far, thanks for reading."

I strongly recommend avoiding playing this game when a new character has been added for a week or 2 until it's been nerfed as player will spam the character and eat you alive.I strongly recommend avoiding this game if you live in a country where this game isn't popular or have a decent player base as you'll be waiting to find a game roughly 10 mins to 2 hours.I strongly recommend avoiding this game if you do not like toxic players as Overwatch has a high amount of toxic players. But this can be different depending on your server.I strongly recommend avoiding buying any PVE mode until it's completed as it's currently not worth the price and they're very short.I strongly recommend avoiding playing solo unless you don't care about winning and you enjoy staying at spawn. Matchmaking in both normal and ranks are poorly design and high amount of smurf players. The spawn will become your new home."

Smokey da Burrr,0,August 11,10,,0,Not Recommended,"Played since launch of OW1. OW2, besides being an obvious scam, has been a great disappointment in most aspects. Nothing that ruined the first game and turned away the community has changed. Regardless of the desperation they find themselves in, they continue to employ the same exact practices that drove the community away in record breaking numbers.Despite the fact that balance changes are (according to devs) made almost exclusively based on high tier meta, the game is still horrifically unbalanced. The devs are actively mad that you are not playing the way they want you to and will gladly take away any enjoyment you had here to fix that. Most changes seem to be based solely on the metric of which hero is being played the least, which can be hard to tell since they have made SO many heroes so un-fun to play. At that, the changes (you'll recognize this if you've played basically any other game from blizzblazz) are always polarized into extremely small and unnoticeable changes to characters that the community has complained about, and game breaking changes to the dev's current favorite that makes competitive borderline unplayable until the ""oopsie we're sorry"" patch three days later. Tanks often invalidate DPS, made worse with the fact that healers are basically expected to pick up some DPS as well. Snipers still dominate at all levels of play thanks to mobility differences and more than half the roster being in one-shot range. Torbjorn is still Torbjorn.Many heroes are now locked behind paywall, and players are able to enter into competitive with these heroes locked.New heroes can be unlocked in the season they released in by playing a certain amount of hours, but older heroes remain locked if you didn't buy OW1. Combined with the hilariously low requirement to gain access to competitive, low to mid tier ranks are plagued with inexperienced players who do not access to mechanics and strategies players who have paid for characters / been around and had time to unlock them in the battle pass. Premium currency in the original game could be gained by getting duplicates from loot boxes that you got for free at every level up, but for the new F2P model they've opted to make the premium currency MUCH more difficult to obtain without purchase. They're charging 15-20 USD for premium shop and league shop exclusive skins.Any player you asked would have told you that no one wanted a battle pass system but they did it anyway. Content of the battle pass seems to get worse with every season, loosely tied themes and leftover concepts to throw at the players so they'll subscribe to a service that they may or may not even get their money's worth from if they don't put in enough play time and pad our player statistics. This has been made even more evident in the Invasion season where the PVE content is being released episodically, which has proven to be desperate in basically every game ever. PVE content, of course, was the main selling point of OW2. In case you haven't heard, they lied about this entirely and have since made an official post backtracking on their promises for story missions and hero levels. DO NOT BE FOOLED - the Invasion update is said to contain ""story missions"" and ""hero progression"" but the story missions are they same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 4 man co-op mode they made for some events in OW1 like Junkenstein and the hero progression is a sad shadow of what they originally promised us, with the added insult of not tracking any stats retroactively, so they expect us to care enough NOW to level our characters up for a reward of.... nothing.Truth be told, I was skeptical of the story-based content in the first place, considering the dev team uses every opportunity they can to inject politics into the game at every possible turn, literally releasing short stories about characters with the sole purpose of revealing their sexuality (you can reliably guess that they're not coming out as straight). By now we're all aware that Blizzblazz does not hire good writers or care much about their stories but the quality of those famous cutscenes that this company is widely known for has decreased and the dialogue is a little more cringe than your average Mahvel movie. This company has done nothing but lie to you for years. Do not be fooled by this sad, desperate attempt to rebuild a player base that they have hated, admonished, punished, and lied to for years. The playerbase and the league scene are dying for a reason."

😎OGDown😎,0,August 24,8,,1,Not Recommended,"Remember the good ol' days when Overwatch was all about fun, strategy, and camaraderie? Well, buckle up, because Overwatch 2 is here to replace all that with a grind-fest that makes climbing a mountain look like a walk in the park!Promising an epic story mode that would rival the greatest tales ever told, OW2 instead delivered... nothing. That's right, the story mode was canceled faster than you can say ""microtransaction."" Speaking of which, say goodbye to your hard-earned player progress and hello to paid cosmetics. Want to grind for something meaningful? Too bad! Your only option is to chase a higher rank, a journey as fulfilling as chasing a rainbow for a pot of fool's gold.Ranked mode? More like ""grind mode."" It's as if the developers knew that the only thing left to strive for was a higher rank, so they made it as grindy as possible. Imagine running on a treadmill, but the treadmill is made of sandpaper, and you're wearing flip-flops. That's the OW2 ranked experience.The Blizzard we knew and loved? Gone, like a snowman in the Sahara. What's left is a vampire husk, thirsting for your wallet and ready to suck every last cent out of it. At this point, the best part of Blizzard games is watching the fallout around their bad anti-consumer business practices. It's like a soap opera, but with more drama and fewer likable characters.In conclusion, Overwatch 2 is like a bad sequel to a movie you loved. You'll watch it, you'll play it, but you'll leave feeling like something precious has been lost. And in this case, it's not just your time and money; it's a piece of gaming joy."

NewtonianLλw,0,August 11,7,,8,Recommended,"Overwatch 2 is an excellent game that encompasses all the critical aspects that make for an enjoyable gaming experience. The art design is top-notch with an almost Pixar look to it. The sound design provides great synchronous feedback for each weapon used, and the music is perfectly themed to each setting. The maps are well-thought-out and include beautiful destinations from around the world. The game modes are the typical ones you'd see in any other online shooter. The large roster of characters each has their own unique costumes and personalities.Consensus:While I would definitely rank Overwatch 2 above many other popular shooters and recommend it to others, I would also be hesitant to invest a significant amount of time in it. The reason for this is consistency. If you've played the original Overwatch and then transitioned to Overwatch 2, somewhere during the transition, consistency was lost. The overhaul changed small details that made the original Overwatch's gunplay streamlined and fun."

DarkmoonBlade of the Darkmoon,0,August 21,3,,1,Not Recommended,"Overwatch porn creators work harder than game developers,unfortunately it is.In 2016 it was beautiful, fun and it was good how they made it I liked it, I had fun honestly and bought it at that time when it was a discount but I gave something to it and it was worth it.But in time to make it free the game seemed like a bad idea, I don't mean those who are happy to play it, so to speak, but I hate the fact that some they gave the money and you come up with the idea of Free-to-Play to have some more players or that you didn't have enough and your ugly game Blizzard dies, at least those who gave money, they bought you the game would have deserved a little more some prizes I say for the only fact that they bought you the big company the game and others after a few years receive it mocha no it seems fair to me and then you know the game with new implementations, new ideas, skins and heroes that you unlock a bit hard to play, I'm not saying to buy it because it costs money and it's not that cheap.You came up with a bad and late idea to bring the steam unfortunately and walk too much in Overwatch and do what only version or version 2 doesn't even I know how to say only with the name and 3 new heroes who by the way are not free you have to do missions to unlock it more recently, that is, to play their game much and well and if you should put some money if you want that hero, ♥♥♥♥ you in *** how come and sorry you don't get any more boxes that you still have something cool or it was a joy when you opened and waited to see what was falling and there were some good things honestly I mean you got more fixed when you played level or some missions or if you were watching Twicht it was a good thing we liked, it still attracted us to the game but now I'd rather watch porn than play this mess of your Blizz unfortunately I want what it was like at the beginning not to walk too much to play or at least bring those back that we liked.We want free heroes to enjoy the game, not to sit and do missions to annoy the team or a kid who after a few minutes comes out and spoils my match or doesn't nothing even trolls, or most who go out and can't do the mission and lose hours and energy, I want to be happy to relax when I play and choose my hero, the variety of heroes we had freedom but now you stole from us and that and we want the boxes back you start copying others to make a profit from us or in general with the new implementations with season pass and other crap that wasn't justified too much with fairly large sums that weren't like that before, with new blocked heroes who just as long ago was not like that, the lack of drops that is no longer and the rewards now half or more than half you have to put the money.You made the game free not to start as it is with CS: GO to come the world with hacks to ruin the game even worse than you have already destroyed what nothing is impossible now, you give them freedom where it was not the case and it shouldn't be after you later sell us some donuts and put only too much money into the game, practically not even to be praised the game that you set him on fire before.If you still have your community and listen to some people, their opinions can still do this time and, put all the heroes for free and unlocked or at least for the week and implement the boxes again will be a little more ok and that means you care and that you care about your community.If I see these for the beginning, I change my opinion and review, if you recommend this game hmm I don't know what to say I liked it at first a lot and I still like it but now it doesn't really appeal to me, too many changes, players come out of matches too many times, monetizing too much, heroes stuck and to unlock either do quite a few missions and you will lose a few good hours and nerves per game from your players or you or that someone will come out or other reason, it's easy to buy it but it costs money that isn't right, season pass the same is a good thing but also bad here I can't say that it shouldn't be this yes I could honestly have to, what you had most of them you lost or what they give you transforms the rewards you had into a few coins are useful but also useless to certain skins which costs a lot and I don't know how you make so many coins. So I don't recommend putting the money in it right now, playing and enjoying it, but you don't feel that joy anymore, and with better money do something else do not waste nonsense.And don't believe what others say is cool game blah, blah, blah that it's worth putting in the money that you get a lot of stuff blah blah, it's not true lies, it's like any game that was good at first and they ruined it in time and now they want to make a profit with some small ideas that didn't make much sense there, others either tell them they are fans or have no business and encourage the game just not the game and the company that is good and brilliant what they did that is not the way to shoot at the responsibility to see that they did not do well what they did."

Benis Barker,0,August 11,3,,1,Not Recommended,"No expense was spared when making this game as greedy as humanly possible. Imbalance and poor changes from OW1 to OW2 will leave you asking where it all went wrong with this hollow shell of a once beloved game. I'm convinced that people who still religiously play this game are an underground cult that have a kink for self misery and reckless spending. Here is Overwatch's business practise in a nutshell.Hold off on making content and repackage your game as a sequel with a new mode.However, in that process burn your company ethics to the ground and sexually harass your employees. When your release this title, make fundamental changes to its core mechanics which disrupts most of your gameplay with ineffective balances and overpowered heroes.Wanna play the new heroes? Buy the battlepass. Don't want to? Pour several hours trying to get to tier 45 only to ask yourself what poor life decisions got you to this moment when you know damn well there are other games that offer their new rosters for free at release. A concept so simple, even riot games does it well. Promise your fans a campaign mode(which was the main selling point of your game), but decide to cancel it after months of delays. Finally, when your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games quickly dies, offer it on steam. Get hit with a wake up call when you realise nobody wanted you to spread your cancer to a better platform, and what you should have done is sell the rights to devs who actually listen to the fans. But since you are so hyper-focused on squeezing as much money out of your fans as much as you can, you won't make any of the requested changes. Instead, you will spend time trying to come up with cosmetics and how to sell them to your gullible consumers."

Dutexo,0,August 12,3,,3,Not Recommended,"Overwatch 2 is a disappointing sequel that fails to capture the magic of the original game.As someone who used to be a long-time fan of Overwatch with over 3000 hours of gameplay, I had some amount of excitement to see what Blizzard had in store for their sequel, but I was left feeling frustrated and bored by the changes they made. Overwatch 2 is not a true sequel, but rather a free-to-play update that replaces the first game and adds some cosmetic features and a new game mode. It does not offer any significant improvements or innovations, but rather takes away some of the core elements that made Overwatch fun and balanced.The most noticeable change is the reduction of team size from 6v6 to 5v5, which also means the removal of one tank role. I am a tank main and this has had a huge impact on my gameplay and my team’s dynamics, since the tank player is essential for creating space, absorbing damage, and protecting my teammates. For me personally by removing one tank, Blizzard has made my games more chaotic, less strategic, and more frustrating. As the singular tank remaining on the team, I have had to bear more pressure and responsibility. The game feels less like a team-based shooter and more like a solo deathmatch, where individual skill matters more than teamwork and coordination.Another change that I dislike is the introduction of a battle pass system and a cash shop that sells skins, emotes, sprays, and other cosmetic items. While these are optional and do not affect the gameplay directly, they still feel like a greedy attempt to squeeze more money out of me as a player. The battle pass requires a ridiculous amount lot of grinding and playing to unlock rewards, while the cash shop sells items that were previously available for free or through loot boxes in the first game.The biggest disappointment for me is the lack of the extensive PvE expansion that Blizzard had promised before. Overwatch 2 was supposed to have a rich story mode that would explore the lore and characters of the Overwatch universe, as well as co-op missions that would challenge us players with different objectives and scenarios. However, what we get instead is a shallow and repetitive PvE mode with no meaningful progression or variety. The broken promise of a PvE mode now feels like an afterthought that was added to justify the name of Overwatch 2, rather than a main feature that would enhance the game.Overwatch 2 is a letdown for me as a fan of the original game. It does not deliver on its promise of being a sequel, but rather strips away some of the best aspects that I loved in Overwatch 1 and replaces them with inferior ones. It feels like Blizzard has lost touch with what made Overwatch great and has succumbed to the trends of free-to-play games. I do not recommend Overwatch 2 to anyone who enjoyed Overwatch 1, as it will only ruin your memories and sour your experience."

𝔔𝔲𝔦𝔫𝔷𝔢𝔩,0,August 11,3,,17,Not Recommended,"""My family tells of an ancient legend about two great dragon brothers -- the dragon of the north wind, and the dragon of the south wind.""This was from an Overwatch cinematic that came out adjacent to the games release. The amount of foreshadowing this would endow in the mind of fans with was unknown at the time, but seems remarkable in hindsight.There were always two sides (or dragons in this metaphor) within Overwatch -- as there always is in art that has turned into a lucrative business. You have the creatives; those with ambition, drive, passion, and a remarkable ability to sacrifice for the art form they love -- the other, those who wish to exploit and sell the art of others. Those who sell themselves as the logical mind behind the creatives.""Together, they upheld balance and harmony in the heavens.""For the most part this was true in Overwatch 1. Though they had lootboxes, they contained so much of so little that their purchase was inconsequential. During this period of 2016-2018, creativity was allowed to flourish -- before the balance wasn't so upheld in the blizzard heavens.""But the two brothers argued over who could better rule their land. Their quarrel turned to rage and their violent struggle darkened the skies until the dragon of the south wind struck down his brother.""From 2019 until overwatch 2 released in November 2022 was when I imagine this struggle happening. Their was silence from the development team. No new content on their new game that was making millions. Devs wanted to create and executives wanted to sell -- resulting in ever-changing goals and no new content for their starving fan base. With Overwatch 2 it seems the creatives at Blizzard have finally given up their struggles for artistic freedom and given into the demands of intellectually stunted and churlish businessmen.""The dragon of the south wind knelt down on the ground and was finally able to see the world around him.""I want this game to succeed. Millions of us do. We love what this game was and what it could be. I want Blizzard to realize their mistakes, become human -- but their gigantic success seems to have severed their ties to the humanity that once defined them.At the end of the cinematic I've been referencing, the brother who was thought to have been killed came back and faces his brother who killed him, beating him in a duel.  The ending remark of this cutscene perfectly describes my feelings on this game.The brother who comes back from the dead says to his murderous, evil brother ""perhaps I am a fool for thinking their is still hope for you -- but I do."""

Daddyo021,0,August 13,25,,2,Not Recommended,"Overwatch 2's microtransaction-laden approach has utterly soured the experience. What could have been a remarkable sequel that built upon the strengths of its predecessor has been marred by greed and a lack of consideration for its player base. It's heartbreaking to witness a beloved franchise succumb to such a distasteful monetization strategy, turning its back on the principles that once made it shine. Until the developers address these glaring issues and prioritize player enjoyment over profits, Overwatch 2's potential will remain tragically untapped."
Han,0,August 16,3,,0,Not Recommended,"+ You're one of those heroes aren't you ?- Not anymore, they ruined the game and then changed it's name by adding a ''2'' at the end of it.Imagine paying $60 for a game to disappear from your library, now you need to farm ''quests'' or buy ''battlepass'' to unlock new heroes. No matter what years passed, i paid money and i become owner of this sh*t back then. If you want to make overwatch 2 go ahead, make overwatch 2 as you wish, full of microtransactions. Add as many heroes you want. But don't try to get my game from me to simply change its name and turn it into the same game with microtransactions and a battlepass. Also don't ever try to sell me skins which were easily obtainable by simply playing.If you just started to this game, don't buy any skins. They may remove them from your inventory, just change their names and force you to pay money to get them back. Even the fact that you can't be 100% sure that this will not happen shows what a crappy company blizzard is.The money they want for one of the skins that I used to be able to get easily just by playing the game is the same as the money I paid to own the whole game back then. I don't care about myself since I don't play this game anymore, but I'm telling you guys to notice how they rob new players. We didn't need to pay a penny for any of these skins. They were coming out of the boxes as part of the sense of progress while playing the game."

His cancerous little adoring-fan looking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ face, his corporate greed, and his seeming hate for women, given he threatened to kill one, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ruined the very last part of Blizzard that was any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good.Jeff Kaplan was the last thing holding the shell of the original Blizzard together.

If you can truly look past the horrible microtransaction hellscape that whales have allowed to form in the industry, and are willing to put 0 money into the game, only to play it for the genuine moments of enjoyment that the game does actually still have to offer and to incur server costs at blizzard, then go for it. Play the game. As a videogame? I can recommend it. But i can ONLY recommend it on the basis that it is effectively a dishevelled corpse of a genuinely really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ great title, and manages to have a few of its good qualities intact.As a product? As something that you, a new player, should try??Nah, I wouldn't. I know that if this game didn't appeal to me since 2016, I'd have left a long time ago.

And if that wasn't enough for you the game itself is a complete mess. Zero balance attempted aside from nerfing characters that don't need to be nerfed just because the aforementioned psychopaths want something to complain about.Also you may notice the big fat 2 slapped on the title. Well that's a misleading bait because all the content they promised for a sequel was never given AND they officially cancelled all that content as well that they'd been working on for 4 years just to throw out some poorly done ""PvE"" content they forced the unpaid interns to make cause they're too busy nerfing characters making the game a much slower and boring experience.

† Ghost †,0,August 12,3,,0,Not Recommended,"The result of greedy sharks who drowned the creativity and passion of developers in the name of money, I introduce you to Overwatch 2 !Maybe it's still possible to have a little fun with it, but there are so many negative points that fun is quickly replaced by bitterness. Overwatch 1 was a fine experience, certainly too generous by market standards compared to other shooters that adopted the battle pass system earlier than it did. But to turn it into such a bad, penny-pinching opposite... I really feel sorry for the developers who see their work crumble year after year.Blizzard won't be able to restore its reputation in the eyes of gamers by continuing down this path. It's not all about money. It's not all about pressure, crunch and abuse of employees. We don't know everything that goes on in Blizzard's offices, but if it comes down to making games that are so money-grubbing and disrespectful of players and developers alike, it's time to stop. Take a deep breath. And clean up this mess. Change the industry. Do something right for once. It happens to make mistakes, no matter how horrible, but it's also possible to fix them, to change. The hypocrisy has to stop.I doubt we'll find the same sensations as in Overwatch 1, but it was great to discover them back then. We miss you, buddy. Version 1.5 of yourself will never be anything but a fetid lie that saddens its fans, a lie because the very purpose of this ""2"" was to go for something new and so exciting, but it will never be that way. Because the slim glimpse we'll be served up like hungry dogs will require us to spend a fortune to access denatured, premature and filthy content. Life is expensive enough these days that we don't need to be knowingly robbed.Don't force people who are too weak and still have a tiny shred of hope left in them to pay. You know very well that there are plenty of them. The point of a game is to be able to play it, not to rub a company's balls regularly with a credit card and then gain access to it. Please don't think of the players as your wh0res, Kotick. Think of people as human beings.You can still try to play Overwatch 2, but it'll be frustrating, the players will be angry/frustrated, the content you'll get will be poor and scattered. Have fun with this crap."

Positives  Steam takes a 30% cut of the microtransactions, meaning less money lining Blizzard exec's pockets Negatives  Cancelled PvE Being lied to for months and months about cancelled PvE Went from being 6v6 to 5v5 Paywall on just about everything Minimal rewards that you can actually ""earn""  Literally just Overwatch 1 on a new engine, a new engine that Blizzard specifically said was needed for them to be able to properly create the PvE mode The PvE missions that WERE added are maybe 20 minutes at most, and there's 3 of them. $15 for one hour of content just to put it in perspective.

Overwatch 2 is like a bad joke that you wish you could unhear. Here's the ugly truth about this fiasco:Gameplay Mechanics: This isn't a game; it's a torture device. Characters are unoriginal, the balance is all out of whack, and playing feels like slogging through mud. Whoever designed these ""innovative"" updates must've been having a bad day—every day.Graphics and Visual Appeal: Did they make this in a garage over the weekend? The graphics look like they're from the Stone Age, and the animations are about as lively as a cardboard cutout. Talk about cutting corners!Storyline and Mission Design: The plot is as shallow as a kiddie pool, and the missions are as thrilling as watching paint dry. It's a masterclass in how NOT to tell a story.Monetization Strategy: If you like flushing money down the toilet, you'll love Overwatch 2's in-game purchases. The entire model feels like a shameless cash grab.Technical Issues: Bugs, glitches, and more bugs. It's like playing ""Whack-a-Mole"" with issues. Someone seriously dropped the ball on quality control.Community Interaction and Support: Trying to get support is like yelling into a void. Good luck getting a response that's not as robotic and disconnected as the game itself.Overall Experience: Overwatch 2 is a disaster, a letdown, and an embarrassment to the franchise. It's like taking everything good about the original and chucking it out the window. Save yourself the frustration and steer clear of this train wreck.--Written by chatGPT--"

You deserve better, I assure you, you do. This game is a massive disappointment to those whose patience was tested for years on end. This game is an unbalanced hellscape with characters that were so obviously unprepared for the switch from 6v6 to 5v5, balancing changes that have no real direction, characters left in near unplayable conditions. The worst part of all imo is that the entire purpose for this game existing, the reason why ow1 was left treading water for years, the extensive hero and story modes, were thrown to the ditch. What’s left of “””OW2””” is a mission pack with archive missions packaged in a bundle promoting a battle pass; Unbelievable. I’m not original for saying this, but I hate this game. But that hate stemmed from a place of love. Many players are so angry because we WANTED this game to succeed; we wanted Overwatch to come back bigger than ever. But because daddy kotick wanted another couple million dollars in his pockets, a game that fostered beloved memories and moments, despite being given ample chance to rise from the ashes, simply didn’t. RIP Overwatch, maybe if Doomfist was a good character, you’d be a 10/10. If you really want your overwatch fix; the porn has more quality tbh."
LexGear,0,August 11,9,,19,Not Recommended,"Would I recommend this to new players? No, and here is why:- The matchmaking has no balancing. They just throw whoever is around together making the games very one-sided.- With no objectives or personal journeys, progress is non-existent. There is just nothing to work towards. To use Team Fortress 2 as a comparison, at least in TF2 you can work on achievements or contracts.- PvE is very boring with nothing but primitive AI and damage sponges.- Game is constantly unbalanced. I do not understand why after all this time they cannot get this right?- Skins and cosmetics are very expensive and pointless when all you can see are your hands.- And worst of all, Overwatch 1, the game I paid good money for, is gone."
dpninja,0,August 12,16,,2,Not Recommended,"I think the most important thing to state first is that I'm very bad at this game. Is that why I don't recommend it? No, but I will admit that there is a bit of spite in this review. Overwatch (2) is a game that reminds me a lot of League of Legends. Not in the gameplay or the visuals, but the feeling of frustration in not understanding something. While LoL has characters that have more power or abilities than others, it's much easier to understand because of how the top-down gameplay works. Even with such a massive list of characters, all you have to do is play two games at the most to understand enough to fight them. Still, this does not circumvent the problem with characters being more powerful or having more utility than you. Overwatch takes this complication to the extreme in the fact that you have made it 3D, an FPS, and basically a movement shooter at the same time (not that all of those three aren't the same thing most of the time anyway). Positioning in LoL is important, but Overwatch makes you consider a third plane that isn't always on screen. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can add to the frustrations. My point in this whole comparison is not to go play LoL, I am just saying that both games are frustrating because of unbalanced characters, and adding the complications of gameplay on top can just make it all fall apart. I'm not good at LoL or Overwatch, but I can still find enjoyment with friends. Still, I can't recommend them. Because why play something if it isn't fun?"

Naraic,0,August 17,4,,52,Not Recommended,"Although I am a stranger on the internet, I hope you can take my word to heart when I report that Overwatch (I'll refer to it as OW) was my favorite and casual 'go-to' game for many years. I have 1960+ hours in-game with my top three, and favorite, 'heroes' being Ana, Zarya, and Reaper. I started playing back in beta (yes, I have the Widowmaker skin). With this information divulged, allow me to share my insight further.From a gameplay standpoint, OW is still a good game. It combines the fundamentals of Team Fortress and, on a basic level, any MOBA. The result is spectacular! Niche characters with niche abilities that [can] combo and create unique, niche experiences each round / session. I have enjoyed hours-upon-hours of back-to-back games. When you have an itch for a team-based shooter, OW is a great way to scratch. Load it up, find a game, and you can be done in less than 10 minutes. In and out, clean and simple. It's great!That written, let me get to the 'meat and potatoes' (read: overall) subjects at hand. I have spoiled you, the reader, by serving dessert first. The good is in the past. I hope you're ready for the rest of the meal!As everything does, OW has changed. In the past, this was cause for excitement; the game would get spiced up and the balance changes were, usually, quality of life (i.e. quality of game) driven at a tier 2, casual level. These days the changes are infrequent, nominal, and [feel] financially driven. As the son of a business owner, I understand 'profit' is an easy way to attach success to effort. That said, I also understand that reaching out to Steam is Activision Blizzard's way of handing a crutch to a failing model. As written by many before me: the OW development team issued many statements (I interpreted these words as goals and promises) that, after years, have not come true. On top the failure(s) to produce, the game has become an unbalanced amalgamation. While OW has a healthy roster of characters, if your ""main(s)"" don't fall under the OP category, prepare yourself to get flamed by foes AND allies in competitive play. This, on a gameplay level, is not okay. Since every character has a niche, balance is key to creating a fun and interactive environment for players. So, today, I dare ask OW devs: why are there SUPPORT class heroes  consistently  out damaging DPS class heroes? Why were tanks, the most diverse and impactful characters in the game, reduced to one player? Why is it okay to charge for underwhelming content that was  promised  to your playerbase years ago? For those of you still reading: allow me to summarize the rest of my thoughts in a simple TL;DR with solutions:1) The characters are not balanced. Adding a 'Ban Phase' would alleviate many issues. Tuning some numbers would create less hostile and lopsided environment.2) Certain game modes are not fun. Adding a 'Preference' or 'Do Not Allow' for maps or modes would alleviate this frustration. Yes, the queues would take longer but, the quality of match would increase.3) The battlepass is  effectively  a subscription to a F2P game. I feel betrayed that most of the new content is locked behind a paywall. As someone with  just  under 2k hours  ingame  I would hope to have the majority of content unlocked. With the new things locked behind a paywall, I have become content with having a diminishing unlock %.4) The PvE content is uninspiring. I was under the impression that we would be allowed access to 'perks' that would modify and resculpt playstyles. Now, instead of playing against players, I can play the  same normal ingame characters  against robots. The fact that it's paid content? As a Reaper main:  pathetic 5) The scoreboard screen is a mistake. Everyone on a team being able to see (although this doesn't mean they can properly identify) teammate's stats is a mistake. It enables toxic comparison in a real-time environment. The number of games that I have played that ended in toxic flaming has  increased .6) The standard 'new character' release method is  frustrating . New heroes are consistently overtuned and overperforming until they get hit with the nerf bat.  IF  the nerf happens. Sometimes it doesn't. Seems to me that the 'patch testers' are, relative to the average player, too good or bottom tier (i.e. NOT average).7) After  roughly  22 in-game hours I have hit level 45 in the battlepass. This, for F2P players, is the level requirement to unlock the newest [overperforming] hero: Illari. To be honest, I understand that Blizzard is trying to coerce players into spending money; this methodology feels wrong. Choosing between $10 or a  literal  day of in-game time to unlock a character? I am openly disappointed.To wrap it up, OW ought to be a paid game. Something manageable ($20?!?) to get players ingrained and committed to the community while fueling the devs passion to produce quality content. Instead, we have a 'F2P' game with microtransactions (that get advertised to you each time you open the game) and, borderline, meaningless updates. This written, it seems to me that this style of game is  ready  for a new Name / Brand to scoop up the majority of the playerbase.If you see me online, let me know how I wrote! I'll still be playing despite all the signs of an abusive relationship. GL HF DDNaraic"

																The gameplay is still fun, because it's just OW1, but there's just so many downgrades:- The monetisation is horrible, the first game had lootboxes that you could buy, but you got them for free at a flat rate by just playing. In OW2 you have a premium battlepass, have to buy new heroes, a lot of the skins are locked behind virtual currency, and you also have to purchase the PvE mode. It's bizarre to think that lootboxes were the better option.- The further reworks of heroes are just terrible, I don't understand why they keep making the classic heroes less fun.- Endorsements are more confusing without labelling their team or what they got awards for.- The awards themselves are gone completely so only play of the game remains (which most of the time isn't even impressive because it's just someone using an easy ult), And only damage dealers get play of the game, there's no award for giving the most healing for support or anything like that.- I find the removal of the second tank to be a dubious change at best. It makes playing the tank very restrictive as they have to work twice as hard now to keep the time alive, and cannot do anything beyond that (like flanking) otherwise their team will die."

So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."

The new level up system is ok, but all you can get are items for your profile. All in all, seeing how Blizzard decided to scrap years of work on the pve content and were content to adopt a chapter system for pve and a lackluster battle pass system for pvp makes the game a lot worse than it could have been."

People will then be happy with the game and therefore spend money on the game. Instead they lie to the fans? and make them pay more money? Who thought that was going to be a good idea...To give credit, they are updating the PVP but WHO CARES. People don't even want to give PVP a chance anymore after this company lied. The newest battle pass looks cool and i would definitely buy it, IF the money wasn't going to Blizzard. I never wanna give them a single dime again. also, for those defending blizzard... you are the reason companies can lied to their players, walk over them like rug mats, and think its perfectly fine."

Bars,0,August 12,3,,0,Not Recommended,"This is just disgraceful. Not even 1 year passed since the game has released, but they already lost their community, or even the hopes of getting something decent. It made many promises, but never delivered them. This game came out as a Co-op title, yet all we get is paywalls and micro-transactions. They will never deliver something worth your time, money, or your respect, for they lack the ability to listen to their player base. (I exclude the animation team, perhaps the best course of action would be an animation series since they are the only people putting some work into it.)"
truncks1,0,August 11,16,,0,Not Recommended,"This game is worse than Overwatch 1. It is overpriced and it has less features than the original. The heroes are now locked behind paywalls so its not even fun to come back to this game. I loved Overwatch and went to the Grand Finals when SF Shock won in Philly. This is not the same game and it deserves to die. The old game was better. 5v5 is worse. They completely cancelled the PvE experience. The rewards for playing are worse than the loot boxes they used to have. How sad is that? I dont even feel rewarded for playing anymore. Blizzard has really gone downhill and it is no longer the game company we remembered it being. It is a money grubbing unfun husk of its former self. If they want to fix this game:Bring back 6v6Let all heroes be playable at all timesBattlepass should let you choose what skins you want instead of junk you will never useBring back your plans for PvE, I dont care if it takes 5 more years but don't stop supporting the base game like you did last time.

lizbean,0,August 23,7,,307,Not Recommended,"from someone with 1600+ hours who actively plays the game since beta, i do enjoy it but wouldn't recommend it if you haven't played before or for a long time, especially not spending money on it.here's a list of all the things wrong with the game i'll edit and add to as i remember them :p- broken ranking system- bad matchmaking- overpriced skins- no premium currency in battlepass, amount you get from challenges is laughable- some balance changes make no sense and feel added for the sake of change- frequent disconnects- incredibly toxic playerbase, even in the most casual modes. playing comp requires chat off to keep your sanity- removing progression- adding back worse progression- 6v6 is better than 5v5, feels more like TDM now- devs focused too heavily on OWL and top 500 with updates and balancing- PvE with no replayablilty when workshop modes can easily put it in- OW1 PvE the same or better than new paid for PvE- charging for old OW1 skins- removed OW1 comp stats from career profile- UI downgraded from OW1- a lot of lazy recolours resold as new full priced skins- souvenirs are bad and are just in the game to pad the battlepass and shop bundles- most weapons charms are very badly made and placement on some heroes is horrible- worse audio, footsteps and spacial awareness compared to OW1- reducing the amount of comp points from end of season to make you play more than you want- most seasonal events / game modes are low tier, even a lot of workshop modes are better"
neapawlitans,0,August 11,16,,1,Not Recommended,"Never played the first game before, but from what I've heard everyone seems to agree that the old game was better in nearly every aspect. From what I've experienced in the second game, the game play itself isn't too bad, it's just that everything around it is. Very.Starting to play the game, a large amount of the heroes are locked. After I played the game for a considerable amount of time, it became clear to me that they were behind a paywall and unless you didn't want to spend money in the game, you would have to put a lot of hours into the game. There are even some heroes that are behind battle passes, which is a huge problem when part a large part of the game is counter-picking heroes against your opponent. Any level of pay-to-win has no place in a competitive FPS at all. This made me even more disgruntled when hearing that the first game had no locked heroes at all.Additionally, this game has a pretty bad matchmaking system. Just playing quick play, I managed to rack up over a 12-game loss streak despite me playing not bad at all and playing with friends who were better than me. I understand this is just a casual game mode and I may have gotten unlucky with who i was going against and who i had on my team, but I've never had this happen to me in any game before. This is an even bigger issue for me after learning that there are deliberate systems in the game to not put such unequally skilled players in a single game. Losing and getting steamrolled certainly isn't fun at all, and apparently this issue even extends to competitive matchmaking which is obviously really bad.My biggest gripe with this game, however, are these terrible blunders that Blizzard keeps making. I've already mentioned a bit of the microtransactions with heroes, but the microtransactions in general are way too egregious even for a F2P game. One really scummy thing I encountered was Gingerbread Bastion being in the shop for 1 Overwatch coin. At that point I had about 20 hours into the game and no coins at all. Trying to earn any was nearly impossible, and if I wanted to buy just one coin, I would've had to get 500 at $5. Why not just make it free at that point? I went through the hassle of trying to grind out the game to get some coins for free last-second before the skin went away in the shop and I eventually gave up. My gf actually gifted me some coins so that I could get the skin, but for some stupid reason it took over 24 hours for the coins to show up in my account, way after the skin was gone.Aside from that very dumb and frustrating situation, I have to mention what they've done to the PVE mode. Everybody knows that story at this point and how ridiculous of a decision that was, but now they're putting out PVE missions for $15 a pack. Apparently, they're not even worth the $15 at all and can be completed in a couple hours. Even worse, people that have bought the Steam DLC are saying that it's not even working. Blizzard is straight up scamming people at this point... The list of the really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things that Blizzard has done keeps going on and on. The way they've treated their employees, how they're literally supporting the termination of Overwatch 2's esports scene by giving teams millions of dollars if they leave, and now how they've brought the game to Steam, which anybody with a brain could foresee that this game would just be bombed with negative reviews, and nothing else. And it deservedly gets mostly negative reviews.I don't think anybody wished for this game to be this mistreated by Blizzard. I just wanted to find an alternative hero-based FPS to Team Fortress 2 that isn't left abandoned and neglected by devs to rot, but it seems like I still haven't found it. Nobody should be supporting this company at all. This game and its devs have to be the biggest gaming disappointments of 2023."

Mamasboy,1,August 12,3,,0,Not Recommended,"Title: A Disheartening Regression from Potential: Overwatch 2 ReviewRating: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)Overwatch 2 had all the potential to be a fantastic sequel that builds upon the foundation set by its predecessor. However, after spending countless hours with the game, it's with a heavy heart that I write this review, as it's evident that the developers have missed the mark on several critical aspects.Visual Stagnation:For a game that boasts a ""2"" in its title, the visual improvements are shockingly minimal. Character models and textures seem almost identical to the first game, leaving me questioning where the development time has been spent. Given the significant advancements in graphics technology, the lack of visual evolution in Overwatch 2 is baffling and disappointing.Uninspired Gameplay Additions:The touted new game modes and features come across as desperate attempts to remain relevant in a rapidly evolving gaming landscape. Pushing the narrative-focused elements to the forefront should have been a bold move, but the execution is lackluster at best. The ""Story Experience"" feels like an afterthought, with uninspired missions that offer repetitive objectives and shallow storytelling. The lack of innovation in gameplay modes is disheartening, making the game feel stale even before its official release.Balance Woes Persist:Overwatch 2 seemed like a chance for the developers to address the glaring balance issues that plagued the first game. Unfortunately, it appears that they've carried over the same problems, rendering some heroes almost unplayable due to their ineffectiveness in certain scenarios. It's bewildering how characters can go untouched for so long, leaving the competitive scene in a constant state of frustration.Communication Breakdown:Effective communication between developers and players is paramount for any live-service game. However, Overwatch 2 seems to have regressed in this aspect, with a lack of transparency about the game's progress, upcoming changes, and overall development roadmap. This disconnect erodes the trust between the community and the developers, fostering an environment of frustration and uncertainty.Microtransactions and Monetization:It's disheartening to witness the focus on microtransactions and cosmetic items overshadow genuine gameplay improvements. The introduction of new skins and other cosmetic items is seemingly prioritized over addressing core issues, which feels like a slap in the face to the dedicated player base. This shift towards monetization tarnishes the game's integrity and leaves a sour taste in the mouths of long-time fans.A Dull Story Experience:One of the most anticipated additions was the story mode, promising to delve into the Overwatch universe's lore. However, what we get is a lackluster campaign that fails to captivate players with its shallow storytelling and repetitive missions. The potential for an engaging narrative is squandered in favour of padding out the game with forgettable content.Uninspired Gameplay Additions:The introduction of new game modes and features was a promising prospect, but the execution feels uninspired. The ""Push"" mode, while offering a slight twist on the classic formula, doesn't add the depth or excitement that the original modes provided. The ""Story Experience"" missions, despite the intent to expand the narrative, often devolve into repetitive objectives that become tiresome to replay.In conclusion, Overwatch 2 feels like a missed opportunity to elevate the franchise to new heights. With minimal visual improvements, uninspired gameplay additions, persistent balance issues, and a lack of effective communication, it's hard to justify this sequel's existence. While I hold a fondness for the original Overwatch, this follow-up is a painful reminder that sequels don't always live up to expectations. I sincerely hope that the developers take this feedback to heart and work towards rectifying the glaring issues that currently mar the Overwatch 2 experience."
im on lexapro,0,August 17,3,,2,Not Recommended,"Just finished playing my first session of Overwatch in 3 years and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's so much worse than I remember.I used to play OW1 with the friends I had in highschool that I couldn't convince to play TF2 instead. I can't remember how many hours/how much money I wasted on it in total. Back in it's earlier days(I started playing around 2017-2018), I remember it being pretty fun. I mainly played tanks before my faves were nerfed to the point where they became next to useless. Then, they kept adding in new heroes that were so OP or broken that they ruined the entire ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. The seasonal PvE events became boring fast. Overwatch's story was basically nonexistent and characters were being ignored. I started breaking free from my debilitating addiction around 2019-ish and finally uninstalled around early to mid 2020, but I kept an eye on the upcoming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from afar. Now, this supposed titan of a class-based shooter game that everyone said would kill TF2 has joined Steam in a shameless attempt to save itself from dying a second time as the previously-mentioned 17 year old hat wearing simulator is reaching record highs in player count(though the bot issue isn't totally fixed lol valve u gotta get on that ♥♥♥♥ pronto. since this game's dying again these devs r gonna need jobs so how ab u hit em up)Everything I hated about OW1 is back but amplified. First off, the gameplay. I remember it being decently fun back when the game had half as many heroes with the quality steadily decreasing as time passed. Now? It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ miserable. There's no skill involved, only pain. You're constantly getting stunned, frozen, thrown around, slept, etc until someone on the enemy team who's been playing for a total of 10 minutes accidentally hits Q and instakills you. It also doesn't help that, with there being so many playable heroes that have the same skinny Caucasian frame, you can't tell who's who in the heat of battle until it's too late. It's just mindless. I don't care who wins or loses, just save me from this hellhole. I didn't even bother looking into their PvE ♥♥♥♥. It looks just as boring as it was before, and I'm not spending actual money to find out if that's the case in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ economy. The worst part is definitely the microtransactions and other paid DLC content. For some reason, Blizzard thought that lootboxes were appropriate for a game that costs $60 but not for a game that's free to play. You used to be able to get legendary skins through free lootbox drops just by leveling up. Now you're expected to pay anywhere between $15-$30 to purchase a single ugly, over-designed skin. You can also purchase items with coins, but they give you so few each week that they're practically useless. This is only covering cosmetics. In-game content, the stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ battle pass, and even playable heroes are also locked behind steep paywalls, and none of it is worth it. Meanwhile, I can hop in Steam's own community market and purchase multiple whole outfits for all 9 TF2 mercs for a total of $5 or trade my abundance of scrap metal for cosmetic case keys. Team Fortress 2's cosmetics also allow for better customization while staying true to the game's art style(with a few exceptions). Blizzard shares no such care for its game or the people who play it, only wishing to milk as much cold hard cash from its playerbase as possible before their servers empty. I wanted to give OW2 a genuine chance. I used to love this game, and I wanted to see actual good things done with it. I didn't wanna log back on after 3 years and see that everything was the same but far worse, but it is. There's nothing here, just the dried out husk of a game that once was. I'm convinced that everyone still stuck playing this game at this point is suffering from Stockholm syndrome, because there's no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way you people actually like playing this ♥♥♥♥. There's no soul, just a pathetic cash grab from a pathetic company. Blizzard is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out unneeded heroes that are locked behind paywalls when the free heroes fulfill their main purpose without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gimmicks. They hype up the game's story when there's none to be had. They suck themselves off when it comes to diversity and acceptance, yet 1) make sure none of the characters have a personality aside from being annoying and make most of the POC characters evil, 2) sameface all of the female characters/copy and paste the same body types, 3) add racist skins that offend the groups they claim to care about and refuse to remove them from the store, 4) censor any mentions of characters being LGBT from foreign releases, and 5) punish players for speaking out against injustice and mistreat their own employees. Not to bring TF2 into this review section for the millionth time, but there really isn't a reason to play Overwatch when it exists. Instead of clogging up the game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ characters that do the same ♥♥♥♥, TF2 features 9 extremely charismatic, lovable, fun to play mercenaries with their own far unique abilities. Each individual class can be customized with different weapons that are useful in different gameplay situations, giving players multiple creative ways to play a single character. Each class is fun to play in its own way and actually feels useful, not to mention playing TF2 actually takes skill(lol). It's had an incredibly fun and replayable PvE mode since 2012 that's FREE TO PLAY(unless you do tours in which case u can purchase or trade for tickets but that's optional), on top of other really fun gamemodes with the most recent being Versus Saxton Hale being officially added. The holiday updates are also wayyyyy better(if you try and tell me that any of overwatch's seasonal events come close to topping scream fortress you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ liar). Team Fortress 2 has a complex story that's explored through comics and animated shorts and, despite taking itself less seriously, has more heart and emotion than the majority of Overwatch's side media. Even TF2's porn is better. Does Overwatch have community game modes where you can play as the heroes with their ♥♥♥♥♥ and balls out? Or art of Roadhog ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ into Junkrat's open mouth? I didn't think so. Honestly, TF2's community itself puts it so far ahead of OW. I meet so many nice, accepting people in matches, and I have more fun playing it than any other multiplayer experience. Blizzard doesn't even care about you guys enough to release a good game with all of its promised features, yet Valve lets fans add their own custom TF2 content in the form of cosmetics, weapon skins, gamemodes, weapons, taunts, comics, events, and even animated shorts. SFM/GMOD animations, fanart, memes, etc are still being made featuring the TF2 mercs even after all of this time. Overwatch will continue to fail until it's but a distant, bitter memory, and people will only come back to jerk off to Widowmaker getting railed by a Fortnite character. This went from being a review to me trying to convince you ding dongs to move on to a superior gaming experience lol. Even in it's current crusty, neglected, bot-filled state, Team Fortress 2 a far better experience than anything Overwatch Poo has to offer, and I highly recommend it, especially since it's currently experiencing a resurgence after 7 years. Anyways, drop this turd and come play a game that'll give you a thick bush. Feel free to add me, I'm looking for ppl to play Mvm and comp with lol and if you're coming from Overweight I'll show you the ropes. :-)"

I got in this season without needing a queue time Cons: The community is really whiny and really toxic especially in competitive. Some people forgot you're supposed to have fun in a game and not care about virtual numbersI said SURPRISINGLY balanced but the game's meta basically is held bent on fractions of decimal numbers and character swapping. The OW 2 update brings several challenges to its progression system by locking charactersthe grind for each character is not something I have had to experience but i cant imagine it would be that funnew characters are locked behind tier 45 of the battlepass which wouldnt be a problem with most games HOWEVER OW's meta has been COUNTER SWAPPING. AKA Ramattra is one of the BEST tanks right now and not having him is extremely unfortunate given the tank's viability in 5v5.although battle pass skins are extremely detailed and great looking, they are character specific and the amount is fewShop items should be ignored. The price range for any skin worth money is around 20 dollars PER SKIN and unlike valorant, no reload animations, no new gun sounds (unless mythic; only in BP) and are character specific meaning you have to: A) like the character B) hope the character is viable and C) own the actual character. the competitive system is STILL being worked on due to F2P player influx so as a new player you might get dunked on plat lobbies for some reason on your first ever competitive match Conclusion Overall, it is free. I'm not sure how hard meta is below high gold but i cant expect it to mean very much so hopefully all the counter swapping meta characters wont matter as I hope by the time you get out of bronze.with the newest character Illari having some of the most solo carry potential in the support category and mechanical skill scaling really well with DPS characters, climbing out of low ELO should be a breeze and if you lack mechanical but make up for strategic positioning, you will find yourself carrying lobbies and outsmarting the mechanically gifted History of Review Bombing HateSo why all the hate? and why all the news?TLDR:the OW community is really annoyed and are acting like children with trigger finger on reviews because they are upset that a PVP on release game is going to be a PVP game primarily from now on.I sympathize with the lost time between the 3 years but lets move on and review the game we have now not the game we hoped for.OW 2 is arguably doing better than many other games ex: Escape from Tarkovthe game hasnt died yet and its free so just play the game and see if you like it. the 30gbs aren't worth review bombing for if you actually enjoy it.Basically, PVE was heavily scaled back and OW 1 was abandoned for 3 years before OW 2's release with lots of teasing and no communication.During the release of the first few seasons of OW 2 the Devs did nothing to tell us about the scaled back PVE and allowed the community and content creators to continue hyping up the PVE release when the devs had already decided to scale it back but knew the game would not do well if there was no PVE hype.It is important to note that the entire community was allowing the Devs to get off the hook for many bugs and little PVP balancing throughout this time in hopes that this was all for a well polished PVE Champaign with lots of replayability.This original vision was scaled back by eliminating replayability basically making the paid for champaign a lore/story driven idea (something like halo infinite in this case) the community felt lied to and the backlash was felt.To top off everything, Blizzard was sinking a TON of money into esports which for OW was at an all time low which has resulted in the next season of Overwatch League to be fully canceled.Although all of these grievances are felt and i very much feel them too, this review bombing spree is unwarrented and i would like to keep an open mind to the future as I HOPE all of this back-scaling on Overwatch as a franchise will give more time to work on WHAT MATTERS: PVP gameplay.I wish PVE would be amazing, I wish that the MMO vision was accomplished and I wish there were two seperate fully kitted out dev teams for PVP and PVE but we don't live that fantasy and the devs have realized that and have stopped overworking themselves balancing OWL, PVE, and PVP all at the same time for a stupidly small dev team with a AAA publisher that doesn't realize the money cow this game could be for AGES. Why Do I Recommend? Its free, its really small, it works on almost any device so WHO CARESthe newest season released really well and the content they have created is something I hope they keep up with especially on the patch notes side.I play scrimmages: Player headed 5v5 matches that last with the same two teams several maps in a row organized through discord servers.they are extremely fun to play and toxicity is at an all time low and it is how I keep hope for what this game could very easily be.I recommend anyone to find these servers and play in them as they are open to all skill divisions where you are placed in a rank of your choosing.

AnkhaAnkhaFootManiac1941,0,August 13,5,,0,Not Recommended,"Overwatch 2 was touted as a sequel to the original game that would feature a PvE game mode that was comprehensive and you could play with your friends.What you get instead: The deletion of the original game, which was already ruined with updates, now quite literally destroyed. A game that is mostly the same as the original with balance updates and a monetization system that priorities the prospects of free to play with the current market trends. Such as battle passes and unlocking heroes. -Not to say the original monetization was better, gambling is objectively worse than not gambling, but it is seen as worse because it is unsatisfying compared to the original because of the length it takes to unlock things. No doubt, and I agree. It is industry standard practices and not as unethical. Too bad industry standards are garbage, and I don't agree it even fits in the argument of ""you know what you were buying"" because you don't. You buy Overwatch 1 and lose it. That was not advertised, and you get Overwatch 2 which doesn't even get the PvE feature they advertised. You do not get what you pay for and even if you did, it doesn't make the willing purchases worth it.The one chance they had to somehow make me a convert, launching the game through the Proton layer to get the play time to review this, failed. Because it crashed immediately while trying to run it. If you aren't even gonna have the proton layer work I don't even know why they are on steam other than the smell of desperation or lawsuits from anti competitive practices or something similar.------Meta-discourse bottomline: This is getting review bombed because as a company Blizzard has pissed everyone off and this is just one of many examples of how. They've earned such hatred it goes beyond reason for many people and it IS a trend and I acknowledge that. But essentially the devs and the very structures of Blizzard. For many people like me, have passed the event horizon. To claw back from their position would take such extreme measures it wouldn't even be the same company it has become. One that destroys their past legacy content like WC3 and OW1. Is known for internal assault, playing good boy (evil) for the CCP's propaganda arm on Taiwan and Hong Kong because the mighty dollar matters more. Diablo immortal... Need i say more? Generally even all of that could be forgiven if they made ♥♥♥♥ that was good. Because people don't care if you do bad things unless you stop giving them what they want...And they can't even manage that. Because they have only the most feeble devs that want to be ""a real developer at a real company"" but debase themselves for that vague, worthless dream. Inject their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they'd rather be doing -anything else- and just use the companies intellectual properties -and our attachment to them- as a vehicles for exploring their own ideas unrelated to the source material or good game making. Or good story telling honestly. Why did both ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WoW and Diablo have planned rape plot lines that were scrapped again? From the company known for SA? That removed ♥♥♥♥ from wow that was too lewd not long ago? Sure the board of directors is evil, but they aren't begging the devs for more rape in games."
Snipar,0,August 10,3,,10,Not Recommended,"One of the few times I want to write a genuine review Problems with the game entirely:  Putting heroes behind the battle pass is a joke. A character can be so game changing at times can make the game seem pay to win. I get that you can unlock these heroes by doing challenges, but that was something i had to go out looking for. I did not know this until LIfeweaver because Blizzard is more focused on promoting to buy the battle pass.  The lack of PvE shows, and will be more detailed in the next list because they're execution in this new update shows how much it will really be missed.   Toxic community and devs. Developers do not bother trying in new updates that brings people over. Even if they did, the people who play this game make sure you dont want to be here. Granted this is a problem with this game specifically, rather another one to list in a pile of other communities, but the fact that this game is being carried by R34 artists says a lot about how much people actually care about this game.  To be added Now my problems with this update specifically that came out on this platform:  Hero progression means nothing. Why have levels for a character and a progression system when there is nothing to progress to? On top of that, why add a whole new progression system when Overwatch 1 has a level progression system for the whole account? ( WHICH CAN BE FOUND IN OVERWATCH 2 ALREADY TRACKED ) Update 1: I just found out the hero progression is for title cards. Thats it. I would of taken basic voice lines or sprays rather than a name card. Sad.  The new game mode sucks. Maps are too big for team coordination and expands the problem further. Example: you die in a fight and they capture the point. Now there is a whole new spawn location for you and your team, except half of your team is still at the old point, which is over 100m away making fights a 3v5 or less.  Beating a dead horse, the lack of PvE is a major loss for this game, and what they added instead of that is a joke. Granted, the paid missions I have not played yet, but if they are similar to what the free one is that I just played, its just Kings Uprising all over again. Bland AI's move from point a to b with lifeless movement makes me feel like im in the shooting range in practice mode. And the objectives are the same thing that has been around for years. Update 2: The story missions are at least interesting, but not worth the money I was right about the AI being bland and boring. Its just an interactive overwatch animation short except you pay $15 a mission. Just watch someone else play it on YouTube.Which brings back to the main question, why is this called Overwatch 2? (Rhetorical Question, we all know its just for the corporate cash grab lifestyle). When i am alone, ill take any other shooter any day of the week. But because my friends would rather play this than something like Team Fortress 2, or any other game someone may name, my soul dies every other day. The moment this game actually gets this ♥♥♥♥ together is the day im happy. I will edit this review if changes actually happen, weather its Blizzard making those changes or my own thoughts change."
