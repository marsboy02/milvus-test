1,"Rheem 36kW Electric Tankless Water Heater Reg. $964, in Store $289 YMMV.",Which store location? Do you have a picture of the advertised sticker price or receipt to price match? Hard to get this hot deal without much to go on
2,"Rheem 36kW Electric Tankless Water Heater Reg. $964, in Store $289 YMMV.",OOS in BC
3,"Rheem 36kW Electric Tankless Water Heater Reg. $964, in Store $289 YMMV.","Saint John, NB. Receipt posted!"
4,"Rheem 36kW Electric Tankless Water Heater Reg. $964, in Store $289 YMMV.",Only seems to be in stock (or is it) in Scarborough in GTA.
5,"Rheem 36kW Electric Tankless Water Heater Reg. $964, in Store $289 YMMV.",You might have to upgrade your electrical service to use this. 36 kw at 240 volts works out to 150 amps. Lots of houses only have 100 amp services.  Better to have a gas tankless water heater if you have gas service.

Not sure if this applies to this unit It's based on the starting temperature of the incoming water. At my cottage it comes in at around 5-10 degrees in the spring, but 25 in the summer. So there is a corresponding difference at the tap of course. It can only raise the incoming water temperature a set amount based on the wattage of the element.  If you're on city/town water there's not so much difference between summer and winter incoming water temps."

If you find your electric water heater isn't providing hot water quickly enough, then have each heating element on its own wire/breaker. For example, a 4800W tank will need two 30amps @ 240V breaker and will consume up to 9600W. Cut heating time by about 50%. And 40amps can fit in a 100/200amps panel.

27,"Rheem 36kW Electric Tankless Water Heater Reg. $964, in Store $289 YMMV.",Isn't the main reason why this needs so much electricity is to keep a heat exchanger ripping hot so water flowing past at 90psi can be heated to 120F in an instant?

In theory both are 100% efficient at heating the water, a tankless doesn't have to keep the water hot however so it's a bit more efficient. And you get an unlimited supply of hot water. I've been using a 27kw chinese one for a couple of years now, requires decalc/maintenance every 6 months as the water here is on the harder side. You can also get sudden increase in temperature if someone else is using (lots) hot water and turn off their faucet elsewhere because the heat then have no where else to go. Best if you can install a temperature mixing valve at the output to prevent this... I set mine to 37-38C so there's less energy waste to heat it to 60C and mixing with cold water, I get warm water on the hot side and reduces risk of scaling, eg with kids. I think when it goes. I'll get a heat pump tank instead, takes more room but less issues and above 100% efficiency."

32,"Rheem 36kW Electric Tankless Water Heater Reg. $964, in Store $289 YMMV.","Nice price for sure, but with a 20kw furnace boiler already on my 200A panel, there is no way I could install one of these. Most decent bottom entry 60G hot water tanks don't use that much electricity on standby to maintain the water temp anyhow. Most have decent insolation around the tank, and the bottom element may come on once in while, but nothing drastic. Yes, if you are going on an extended vacation, you may as well shut it off, but otherwise, I don't see an issue. I replaced y 60G electric, nearly 16 years ago, and still going. Probably overdue to replace it, and will probably do that next time they have a sale on them  Either way not worried too much, it is right next to a large drain anyhow. Now, if natural gas was available in my area, that would be a different story "

I agree, but you can go to 300A/400A service for few thousand if power coming from overhead to house, underground would be a different story. The AC I installed in that townhouse must have been like 1200sq ft , 200A service is nuts as the minimum but I guess with the electric cars becoming the future they need to be at that.

I don't see your point. With a 20kW furnace (which I have also, but in a form of a boiler with water circulation rads), you are looking at 85A. With a 24k BTU A/C, 2 fridges, 2 stoves, 60G hot water tank, Dryer, washer, etc.., not to mention all the other appliances, there is no way you could add this to a standard 200A service. I'm in QC also, with my current Hydro bill, I feel like a Hydro VIP customer. It hurts at over $4k/yr in hydro costs. So just because hydro price is cheap does not mean you have the infrastructure to support unlimited electrical devices. To be able to have a lot of high power devices, you'd need to upgrade to a 400A service, which is not very common yet (at least not here in QC). This would involve hydro replacing the incoming lines, and a new meter. Then you'd have to get an electrician to do the inside  work. Either complete new panel, or a new main breaker and sub-panels (ugly patches in my opinion). For now, it is overkill for most. However with higher power requirements, like electric car charging outlets and other stuff, it may become more standard going forward. When i bought my house 22yrs ago, they had a 120A service entrance, and ugly main breaker panel with piles of spaghetti subpanels. They already had this 20kw boiler, and let me tell you, it was a fire hazard. You had to see the inside of one of the sub-panels (it was crumbling from the constant overheat). It was the first thing I replaced, and upgraded from a 120A service to a 200A service, ripping out all the subpanels, and replaced with one nice large breaker panel (60 breakers). Best upgrade I even made. Plenty of room to properly isolate everything during other renos (bathroom, kitchen, basement/media room, etc..) With Montreal having already banned wood burning fireplaces for the most part, and trying to slowly ban oil burning furnaces (in the very near future), there won't be much of an option for many people, but electric and upgraded panels. Natural Gaz which I'd love to have in my neighborhood would be nice (for stoves, bbqs, furnace, water heater, etc..), but unfortunately the network is limited and not available in my area. Propane is not a huge option, since I don't have enough space to put the ugly big tank without being legally too close to a neighbor."
35,"Rheem 36kW Electric Tankless Water Heater Reg. $964, in Store $289 YMMV.",This is a bad choice if: 1) if you already have gas service 2) your grid is consist of majority of burning fossil fuel 3) You have not invested in solar + battery in your home

40,"Rheem 36kW Electric Tankless Water Heater Reg. $964, in Store $289 YMMV.","I was recently involved in a project where a 400a service was installed in a residential building. Apart from the obvious extra cost of the materials, the electricians were not that well versed in the install as they hadn't done one in over 5 years. The local electrical suppliers didn't even carry stock on a lot of the required materials. HydroOne didn't really have an issue with it (surprisingly) once you talked to the right people. I never saw the final bill, but if I believe the final bill for the service was 2 to 3 times that of a convention 200a service. In my opinion, I think you have some much better options out there for the delivery of hot water. This unit is geared at a pretty niche market."

With Electric cars and carbon exhaust elimination in process ie. no natural gas furnace (who knows the timeline) 300A/400A common panels are around the corner but not now. This heater would be geared towards commercial 208/220V applications or homes where hydro is cheaper (yes QC is much more cheaper than Ontario) so no chance this would work in Ontario at all. Propane and Hydro in Ontario is too expensive so NG is best way at the current rates. Next cheapest would be geothermal but big initial cost.  So you know what I see here in Ontario I went to quote a central air system for a townhome that only had electric baseboard heating, homeowner told me they were paying $800 a month in hydro during winter months with stat set to 19C. Hydro in the 70s here was cheaper or on par with NG so many homes built in timeline are electric baseboards or electric furnaces. Thats close $5000 just in hydro during winter months for a townhome so $4K for your i'm assuming detached house isnt as bad as you may think. To change your panel to whatever 200A/300A/400A the homeowner would need to change meter sub base, panel obviously and then the wire leading up to the connection up at the pole on home. This can all be done in a day as its scheduled with electrician , ESA and local utility, $3000-$5000 in Ontario. Homes large or small with EVs , Hot tubs/sauna going to need min 200A then you add a detached garage/work shop etc. 300A easily, in future when no more NG furnaces and it goes to electric then add 2 EV charging stations with Hot tub/sauna with detached work shop sub panel its coming to 400A. This is years away so until then NG all the way or have a commercial space were you dont pay electrical then get this thing lol"

One thing we really found annoying though is the fact that these tankless systems require a certain minimum flow before they start heating up the water. How did that impact us? I personally like having a trickle of hot water while doing the dishes (for rinsing purposes). The flow wasn't quite enough for me to be able get hot water out of the tankless system. I'd also say that it took a little longer before I could get hot water in the kitchen compared to the gas heater that we had before. A small annoyance, but a noticeable one nevertheless. Some people install a small tank underneath their sink in the kitchen to work around the two problems I explained above."

If you're talking about the resistor, that's only for C to A cables; it's not so much that a cable without one would necessarily damage your phone, but the cable and or wall adapter might catch fire without it lol. Sure your phone could be damaged as a result too but it's more the fact that without the resistor it can overload the wall plug and/or cable. I got my own question though, for anyone that can answer... When you plug a phone into a computer via an A cable it typically charges quite slowly which is expected given the old skool 500mA limit of USB ports on computers. Basically you get like 300mA charge rate. If you use a type-C to type-C cable and plug into a native type-C port on a computer, will you get more charge current?"

The answer to your question depends on what USB protocol is implemented inside the type-C port of your computer. If it is USB 3.1 then I believe that the specifications allow for up to 3A of charging current to flow out to the connected peripheral (and up to 5A to flow in the other direction, charging the laptop's battery from a charger).  But, if the phone is fitted with any of the modern charging protocols (QC2, QC3, etc.), there is seldom need for a charging current of 3A, because it is much easier to increase the charging voltage at the USB 3.1 port (e.g. instead of 5V and 3A charging, the protocol will negotiate a charging current of 1.25A at 12V)."

C-C cables, even the cheapest ones that is only USB 2.0 for data, is already sufficient for most phone quick charging at 18W.

When you plug a phone into a computer via an A cable it typically charges quite slowly which is expected given the old skool 500mA limit of USB ports on computers. Basically you get like 300mA charge rate. If you use a type-C to type-C cable and plug into a native type-C port on a computer, will you get more charge current? Going back to my own post here, the answer is seemingly yes, it will charge much faster. When I plug my phone into a computer USB A port, I get a low charge rate as mentioned. I did actually have a Type-C to C cable lying around which I think is 2.0 since it's pretty thin/cheap lookin' but when plugged into an office PC's Type-C my phone did indicate ""Charging Rapidly"" instead of ""Charging Slowly"". So Type C to type C does work better in this scenario. Messerschmitt wrote: Can anyone explain me who uses USB-C t o USB-C? Usually wall chargers use USB-A into USB-C (or micro usb).  In which case is a USB-C to USB-C used? It can be used anywhere you have two type-C ports. Type-C is, first of all easier to plug in as we all know. Also it's connector agnostic. With older USB types other than the ""OTG exception"", USB devices always have to have B ports while hosts have to have A ports. With C, the ports are all the same and the devices/hosts handshake between who does what. That's why you can have a C port that charges the device (power input) but that same port can connect to devices to charge them (power output) and provide data connectivity. I do agree somewhat that C is not really necessary or desired all the time. I mean think about how many USB micro-B cables most of us probably already have while USB-C cables might be more minimal. Plus if you plug one end into the wall charger and are only ever plugging/unplugging the device, you don't really care about the ease of plugging in a type-C on the other side as it's basically a stationary connection you seldom touch. Quick Charge protocols like Qualcomm's QuickCharge don't really care about USB-C or even the cable quality all that much because its purpose (to charge faster) is achieved through higher voltages which means less current in the cable--therefore lower quality cables can support QC pretty well, even if they can't charge very fast on 5V. However charging on 5V is also of note here as 5V charging on Type-A cables or connectors is limited in many cases. As I described above a phone will typically only charge at around 300mA on a regular data port on a computer; USB 3.x provides 900mA but just like the 2.0 standard gave 500mA in theory and less (~300mA) in reality, the same thing happens there. In my example the Type-C cable conencting to a native Type-C computer port allows up to 1.5A of charge current (and as much as 3A, depending on the host capability), which is enough to be considered a ""Rapid Charge"" in Android's classification.  5V charging with wall adapters/car plugs, will of course follow BC specifications instead as they are not computer/data ports and so you can have much higher charge currents at 5V, on Type-A cables/ports. However with 5V charging the cable quality is of relatively high importance because poor cables will not charge at higher rates because the charger and device on the ends are smart enough to know the cable's resistance so as not to set the cable on fire lol. Though a crap cable could still melt or catch fire at 800mA-1A so yeah.  This is why both QC (and other competing standards) along with PD make much more sense--instead of trying to push relatively large amounts of current through millions of different cables consumers may buy, with widely varying quality, increase the voltage instead which results in less current for the same power--taking a lot of the cable quality concerns out of the equation. Since we're not talking about putting hundreds of volts through the cable, the cables still handle the voltage fine and then are left to carry half the current or less for the same given power delivered to the device.  Sorry a lengthy explanation, which you may know a lot about already, not sure. But going again back to the Type-A bit, again with PD I believe there are limits when using cables that have connectors other than Type-C, which is another reason why you'd want a Type-C to C cable instead of one with an A end on it. As another random note about cable quality, USB 3.x cables are almost always made with higher quality than their 2.x counterparts. I'm sure it's possible to have a high-quality 2.0 cable and a shitty quality 3.x cable but for the most part most 3.x cables are pretty good. This is why I always recommend people use a 3.x cable for Android Auto even when the head units out there are almost all using only USB 2.0. It's still quite apparent that many 2.0 cables don't work well with AA, whereas using a 3.x cable typically instantly solves the problem of AA ""black screen"", dropouts, hiccups, freezes, etc. AA is another thing that is highly dependent on cable quality and even Type-C cables that are 2.0 seem to readily fail with AA compared to a 3.x cable.

It will likely deliver the 1.5A (5V) ""Android Rapid Charge"" but that's about it. QC 4.0 is PD compatible, but not earlier versions. So, you won't charge super slow or anything, just not as fast as with QC. OTOH QC is more easily ""spoofed"" enabling wide compatibility through non-proprietary/non-licensed chargers with pretty good results. For example, all those portable boosters that have QC USB ports on them are doing so via non-official/licensed means, I'm pretty sure. Also Anker's PowerIQ apparently does the same and can charge QC devices with the higher voltages, despite not being QC certified (some Anker products actually provide both official QC and PowerIQ ports though). PowerIQ therefore gets some compatibility I believe, with other quick-charging standards like Mediatek's PumpExpress, etc.  I think the only one that's super proprietary in nature and not compatible with anything else is Oppo/OnePlus DashCharge, because OnePlus is stupid, lol. But really because DashCharge/WarpCharge is based on 5V, using currents from 4A to as high as 6A (!) for whatever unknown reason  This puts really high demands on the cables which means not only to do you need a DashCharge charger to quick charge, but you also need DashCharge cert. cables as well. All of which can be purchased at high $$$ from your friends at OnePlus lol. This is one reason not to buy their phones that use this 5V high-current charge business. Compatible with nothing and seems to make no sense really. OTOH their wireless charge standard is pretty good, though again super-proprietary."

Most of the time, if you have a laptop, you just want something to extend/supplement the laptop's battery. Normally you carry something like a 10000mah to charge a phone and iPad, but won't fully charge your MBA. They start to get unwieldy and heavy when you get above 20000. Also there's a limit to what you can carry on an airplane.  The Air has a 50wh battery which translates to approx 14000 mAH battery pack. So you're looking at the 16000+ mAH models As for brand, I don't have any particular recommendation. I'd probably opt for something like this that has multiple ports and enough to cover laptop and a couple of phones"

There are are few amazing 38"" coming out from different brands. Probably the same panel. Just waiting for it to be under 1200. I looked into this 49"" a few weeks ago when Samsung had a sale and it was under $1200... and my issue is table space. You have to have a massively deep table to avoid being too close or with only your wrists on the table - not great for anything. Some other manufacturers have a stand that is smaller but Samsung's 49"" has a massive stand. That and due to the 32:9, it's only like 2x 27"" monitors.

Disagree completely with the ""resolution race"" comment except maybe from a marketing perspective, competitive gamers (I'm not one) play at 1080p with min settings and max Hz to maximize performance. Beyond that, resolution is mostly a function of monitor size for day-to-day use to minimize scaling. And no, 4K scaled down to 1440p isn't the same as native 1440p and also requires extra hardware to drive the extra pixels for no productive reason. Me, I'm good with 1080p at 22"" (below 22"" I find native unscaled text to be a bit too small but I can make do with my 15"" notebook @ 1080p, it just wouldn't be my daily driver), 1440p at 27"" (I've had a U2711 for years and it's perfect) and I'd expect 4K at 37"" would be fine but haven't tried it. I like 27"" at the distance I sit so I'm also expecting my next monitor will be 27"" 1440p, and the one after it likely will be as well. I don't see a race, I see that human eyesight isn't perfect even at my 20/20 (as of last appointment, anyway) and there are significant diminishing returns that kick in long before 4K for a monitor sitting a couple of feet away from you. I've only ever gamed at 60Hz but I trust all of the first-hand accounts and actual supported testing that higher refresh makes for smoother and more enjoyable gameplay even beyond 60Hz. So, while I expect to be at 27"" / 1440p for the medium term, I do expect my future monitors will have higher refresh rates than my current 60Hz, I'd probably be looking at the 144Hz-240Hz range. There isn't really any reason not to at this point based on how long my monitors typically last."

I bought this (a CRG9) last time it was on sale and I was physically in staples wanting to order it and they wouldn't price match $20 on a $1300 monitor, so I drove 5 minutes and bought it from bestbuy for less without having to argue about the price.  Staples lost a major sale, like they deserved. They wanted you to leave. They would rather hold onto the limited stock they have for customers that will buy at sticker and might buy extra services or accessories. I did it all the time way back when I worked in retail. People get sales revenue confused with margin, and these electronics have shockingly little margin on them, even if there is a back-end rebate. The worst were back to school sales on $500-$600 laptops: You would get people coming in trying to negotiate hard for a limited quantity dry laptop, meanwhile the margin in the system was legit -5%.

That's what I'm trying to say: They didn't have any in store, and they only had so many in the warehouse, so as soon as you ask about price matching they'd prefer you walk. A parent that comes in for their kid and buys a longer DP cable, keyboard and warranty is the customer they want. The discussion on electronics margins is a deep rabbit hole, but the coles notes are that one chain lowered their prices and removed all the ""free"" extras, then sold those addons separately. If Sears advertises a TV for $2800 and Best Buy advertises the same for $1999, you're going to Best Buy. They then sell all the stuff that comes free with the sears TV and the total purchase comes out to over $3,000. People are mostly wise to this now, but that's how we got here. They did it to themselves for short-term gain, but those chains probably would have lost to Sears if they hadn't. Pointing this out to help with future encounters: First thing I always do now is ask about the warranty and how long I have until after purchase to add it on. Gives you an out to buy it and grabs their attention. I got $200 off my current TV (that was already on sale) as a way to sell the warranty to my ""cheap wife"", then just didn't go back. (Warranty was $449 for 5 years). This is true of any new product or big release: Xbox, iPhone, they don't care about unit sales, each one is seen as an opportunity to sell extras that actually make them money."

You would be surprised then. When 13-18 year old kids bring their lost parents in to buy something like this they want to get everything so ""they don't have to come back"". This is how $200 HDMI cables were a thing. I worked the finance side at a car dealership for one summer and you would also be shocked at how many people don't do the math on interest. They would get an extra discount on the sticker price, but then get killed in interest and be happy with the deal.  I love your optimism, but you're giving people way too much credit here. If you ever get a chance to shadow a sales role, I think you would find it very interesting. If this were the real world, we could sit down with a drink and I could tell you 50 stories that would make your head explode. I once sold a 5 year extended warranty on a powerbar that came with a 10 warranty. Didn't lie or mislead in any way, just offered it with a straight face.

I agree with everything you're saying, I'm only giving my experience in regard to how things went down. I know you weren't trying to negotiate, but to them $20 is still $20 and it also signals that you're unlikely to buy extras. It's a broken approach, but this is the prevailing mentality. I'm willing to bet that if had come across to them as someone open to the extras, the MOD would have made it happen for you. Hopefully this info helps you out next time. They will go out of business. Staples is already on it's last legs and it's now owned by venture capital. Honestly, covid might end up being the final nail in the coffin.

For his particular case, he would be better off with a 38"" 21:9 for more vertical space or for his desk probably 29"" max. But then again, he is also working what seems like a 10"" laptop with multiple windows - that's just insanely bad( at the same viewing distance as his laptop by the way) I am not trying to be negative, I am just pointing obvious flaws, especially when it comes down to health.  The proper way to get a monitor is to sit properly at your desk then measure how much realestate screen can fit in your vision without moving your neck. That's the ideal monitor for that area and depending on how you sit, how close and how big the desk is, the proper monitor will be different. Even for gaming, once you turn your head to look, for example, what is happening on your left, you just killed yourself by someone who was on the other end. Aside from FPS, that's another reason why competitive gamers aren't playing on massive monitors."

The S10 Lite lacks features from the S10 such as a QHD display, telephoto lens, Wi-Fi 6 support, 3.5 mm jack, and ultrasonic fingerprint sensor.  Also this is up to personal preference, but if you're comparing the regular S10 to the S10 Lite, the S10 Lite is much larger and heavier (which are cons for me). Notably it's very different from the S10 as well because it is actually bigger than the S10+ for screen size and has better battery and charging rates. As many reviews said its design is more like S20 and S20 Lite might have been a more appropriate moniker."

If any of your friends have a OP7T, I would recommend trying it out (typing, navigating, putting it in your pocket, etc.) as they are virtually the same size.

Probably not a ""gimmick"", but the importance of having the latest and greatest Gorilla Glass differs greatly among people. I always use a case, so I've never had too much of an issue with cracking screens. Also, generally speaking, the more drop-resistant the glass is, the more scratch-prone it will be, so Gorilla Glass 3 might be more scratch resistant."

Placed an order on B&H this afternoon for the 8gb variant. and found that a few bands are missing (probably it only affects travellers). so I cancelled my order on B&H and just placed another order on ebay. I chose the accelerated shipping as it is only $6 more, considring the steep shipping fee even for the slower method. I dont think you can tell a difference between 6gb and 8gb in a daily usage within one year or two, and the price difference for 2gb ($24) is kinda OK... ( normal chinese manufactures charge CAD$40 for 2gb of ram) so I decided to take the 6 gb variant. OK here is my updates. Sad story alert. The only advantage is it is FAST, I placed the order two days ago and now it should arrive today. but everything else is !@#$% I choose the faster payment offered by the Ebay seller (it doesnot mention which company is used), and it turns out to be DHL. Instead of taking only $1 processing fee from B&H, DHL charges around $20 ($15 for processing fee and $5 for transaction fee). Moreover, as I just switched credit card from capital one world elite to PC world mastercard, I didnt notice that PC charges 2.5% for foreign transaction. Even with the 2.5% currency conversion fee, the number doesnt add up: the ebay invoice shows USD 412.98 / CAD 559.01, credit card statement shows 583.91 instead of 572.99.

458,Ninja Foodi Digital Air Fryer Oven $199.99 with promo code FOODI30,"I did a bunch of air fryer research the past couple months. Here is what i learned: Some people think air fryers are basically just well marketed convection ovens. In most cases, a convection oven can do everything an air fryer can, but not the other way around. But there are good reasons to buy an air fryer over a convection oven. I think it’s a lot more convenient, a slide out non stick tray makes it worthwhile alone, it’s so easy to clean for most models with soap and water or just dump it in the dishwasher. The convection oven air fryer models are a pain in the ass, my breville smart oven looks like i stained it with grease. If you want an air fryer, the popular options are: 1) one of the foodi models Pros: i think most of them have combined IP + air fryer. Pretty handy if you are on a budget/space constraint Cons: i think they are hard to clean. Ive read that food often gets stuck to the air fryer part because you can’t remove the top lid (this doesn’t apply to all models. But even the one OP posted...you can save space by lifting it up but at what cost, does all the grease just run down to the back?) 2) instant pot + air fryer attachment Pros: good if you already have an instant pot, save a bunch of money by just buying the lid Cons: if you don’t already have an instant pot i think the foodi is a better buy if you need the air fryer. Just my personal opinion so read up if you think you want to buy this combo 3) ninja (not the foodi, just the regular air fryer) Pros: good brand, easy to clean Cons: i guess i couldnt come up with a reason not to buy the foodi for the same price. I guess the regular air fryer is more convenient if you are mainly just air frying. 4) corsori Pros: highly rated on amazon. Over any other air fryer listed here. It’s the cheapest and works just as good if not better than most. The 5 quart size is on sale for $140 right now, that’s cheaper than any other option’s 3.8 quart models. Cons: make sure you don’t get the wifi model. It seems cool that it notifies you via app when to shake your food but apparently the buttons are terrible and don’t work half the time, this problem does not exist on the regular models. 5) Philips Pros: if you a baller just buy this. Best air fryer on the market. Has some patented air fryer technology that they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars developing so your chicken nuggets can be like 5% more crispy than the alternative models Cons: expensive as ****. I ended up buying the cosori 5 quart and an instant pot for like $100 less than i would have spent on the 3.8 quart Philips model. But I’m cheap and you may not be. TLDR: If i have unlimited budget, I go with the Philips air fryer. If not, cosori is the best option if you plan on only air frying. Otherwise i would get the foodi (not this one posted by OP, the IP + air fryer model) if you plan on using the pressure cooking features."

Read my post on the previous page. The guy complaining about his foodi not fitting on his counter could have saved himself some buyers remorse. Foodi’s are hard to clean and while they can save some space by reducing the number of appliances, the unit itself is pretty bulky.  That’s why i opted for a regular air fryer, where all you need to do is pull out the tray and wash it with soap/water or just toss it in the dishwasher. Using parchment paper liners makes cleanup basically non existent. Ive had convection oven/air fryer combos in the past...man, i really hope this foodi is easier to clean. As soon as you get food, oil/grease etc stuck on the interior it’s basically there for life."

Make sure to get the 8 quart version that comes with the air fryer lid if you want to cook a whole chicken. The 6 quart is the ""standard"" size but won't fit a whole chicken in it, but it's also much smaller. The 8 quart is massive but will be good enough to feed an army "

A Bug's Life Aladdin (Live-Action, 2019) Avengers: Endgame Brave Captain Marvel (now $19.99) Cars Cars 2 Finding Nemo Finding Dory Good Dinosaur Lion King (""Live-Action"", 2019) Princess and the Frog Unfortunately there's some real good ones that were also price-dropped but have been out of stock essentially since they were released (like Ratatouille)"

I just tested it against 3 leak testing sites and it did not leak DNS. I have a sub at a different provider and this is the same VPN that's included. It used to be a different provider which was faster and had more locations. They have been adding locations as time goes on. For me, the speed of an US OpenVPN connection averages around 90 Mbps when connected via my router and latency is ok too. As a ""free"" bonus, it isn't horrible and in my experience, works more reliably than PIA for streaming."

Wheel cleaner is fine it's the tyre shine I was talking about. You're just looking for trouble with that stuff #1; #2 it's pretty tacky to have glossy/shiny tyres in this day and age. Maybe if you're tolling the streets of Detroit or something, that might be what they do there, but yeah a bit passe otherwise. Speaking of wheel cleaners and Iron-X... A lot of people don't realise that all Iron-X is, is the same thing in wheel cleaners. Well not all wheel cleaners, but certain types. There's basically three types of wheel cleaners out there: 1. Glorified soap (this is what Diablo is, BTW) 2. Iron-remover wheel cleaners (pretty much anything that's a squeeze trigger and ""turns purple"" or ""changes colour"" fits in this category) 3. Acid-level wheel cleaners They basically go in that order from mildest/weakest to most harsh/strongest. #1 is basically unnecessary and just a waste of money, doesn't do much and doesn't really clean without agitation; and soap & water will do the exact same thing but it won't come in a fancy labelled bottle telling you it's ""wheel cleaner"" lol. Diablo fits in here, it's pretty much just a gel type soap, not really anything more.  #2 is alright but unless you have tough/embedded metal/brake dust in your wheel, you don't really need to use it. Just use soap & water and a sponge. However this is pretty much the same stuff that they sell as ""iron remover"" only typically a lot cheaper. So instead of buying that stuff, buy some of this. Yes it works fine on paint because it's the same chemical and these are mostly pH neutral and designed for wheels that are clear-coated, just the same as your car body is. #3 is typically not something you want to use unless...you're either really lazy and don't care about the risk of etching/staining your wheels; have wheels that are in really shitty shape to begin with/you don't care about; have severe staining/dirt on the wheels that you can't get out with standard soap & water scrubbing. We don't live in the age of ""mags"" or chrome wheels anymore, unless you've put custom/aftermarket ones on; most factory wheels are painted and clear coated and majority of modern aftermarket wheels are too. You don't want to be spraying acid on them as a lazy man's way of cleaning them because you think the ""spray on hose off"" action is the way to go...again unless you don't give a crap about them. blazed16 wrote:  I dont mind the CG stuff however its a gimmick and alot better stuff out there.Yes a bit more money but you will get alot better.I do like there butter wax for when i dont want to spend the time with the good expensive stuff.Also wifes vehicle usually gets the CG treatment haha. Personally I think the best CG products are the washes. Problem is they have like 16 different car wash soaps for unknown reasons and all are pretty much the same thing with different colours/scents/names. The citrus wash/gloss is probably the only one that has any difference from the rest. Basically the best move is to grab a gallon of whichever one comes on sale on Amazon for the cheap price and you'll be set for a long time.

Yep you could definitely clay wheels, however I would not use that piece of clay for the rest of your paint thereafter. This is the same as you would never use the same bucket/wash water and sponge/towel that you used to clean the wheels, on your paint. It's just a bad idea. Most people couldn't be bothered to painstakingly clean wheels with clay though, this is more something one might do on a show car or a garage queen Lambo or Ferrari they might own, lol. Plus if they had one of those they'd probably be paying a pro-detailer to do this ""common folk"" work  Speaking of 80s comeback I saw a dude in a '91ish Trans Am GTA yesterday with an obnoxiously loud exhaust yesterday in Brampton. Like obnoxiously loud, and definitely no cat on that either smelled absolutely terrible. These people should be jailed IMO.

For the first year I had a CPAP, I just cleaned the tubes and water tanks using soap and water on a weekly basis. I bought the SoClean 2, and I find it convenient because all I have to do is put the mask into the SoClean machine and press a button. The caveat is that you have to buy a new SoClean filter every 6 months, so that filter replacement is another expense. I still clean my tubes and water using soap and water once a month to remove grease and dirty from the mask."

675,SoClean 2 CPAP Cleaning System Plus 20X PC Points,"I find that using the RemZZZ product or a similar fabric barrier between the silicone and the skin works well. In fact, you just buy one box of RemZZZ to use as a template and then you can just buy fabric and cut out as many as you want.  I have a similar product that I bought on Amazon that looks a lot like a baby sock with the toe end cut off. You kind of fold it around the nose-mask interface and it isolates your skin from the silicone. They are $20 each on Amazon but I have no skin irritation at all even if I don't wash them for weeks. I am going to buy a pair of cotton baby socks for $5 and see if they will work. I think if you have a full face mask, an adult sock might work. The people on the forums who seem to know a lot, are very opposed to systems like SoClean. Usually your insurance company (if you're lucky enough to have insurance), will pay for new hoses and masks every 3 months, or at least give you $300 a year or so. After two years, I have 5 serviceable hoses. I just swap out the hose every 4 days or so, and then I clean all 5 at once with soap and water when they're all used, does not take long."

I'm sure you can find it cheap somewhere tho.

Actually, I wish there was a way to cool the air as I find it easier to breathe. As for the masks, I would suggest that you only buy the silicone cushion part of the mask and only change the whole headgear when absolutely necessary. I have bought some ResMed Activa LT cushions for as low as $16 online. I only change them once the silicone will no longer provide a good seal. Do clean them periodically though. If you have no insurance, do not buy locally. Buy online. My preferred online store is CanadaCPAPsupply but I'm sure there are many other good ones."

P208B drill has LED light. Otherwise specs seem the same. (HD's page mentions LED light for the 4-tools set but another resource says the P271 doesn't have) P506 circular saw has laser guide and is heavier. P117 charger is faster (advertised as a 30 min charger, vs 1-hour for the P118). P117 also tells you if the battery being charged is overheating. P514 reciprocating saw mentions coming with 2 blades. 4-tools benefit: P515 reciprocating saw, while heavier, is bit shorter and better weight balance. Couldn't find much on the lights, but only the P704 is listed on Ryobi's site now. But comparing just the similar items, the 6-tools seems much better.

807,Ryobi 18V ONE+ Lithium-Ion Cordless Combo Kit (4-Tool) w/ (2) Compact Batteries - $134,"These tools have come such a long way, I highly doubt you would be disappointed. If you plan to use them for DIY / renovations they are hard to beat. If you work in a trade or in a business where you plan to use them all day long, I would go up a level. For their purpose, they are just as good, if not better, then most other brands. The only difference is durability and feel. Dewalt is made to be on a worksite and abused. That’s not to say a Ryobi tool can’t take a beating, they simply may not hold out as long. For example - over the last week I have used the ryobi drill / driver to put in over 5000 deck screws. (I own Ryobi and Dewalt) The only difference I noticed was the Ryobi was hotter after a couple hours of use. In the last week I have updated my drill / driver / oscillating tool /angle grinder / table saw / Brad nailer to Ryobi and I will never look back."

You're saying it's not worth it? Was also considering the Weber Gen II deal from costco for 999. Man I'm so utterly disappointed in the prestige pro 500..it's messed up. Do your 999 and pocket the rest, or get the masterbuilt 560 with the rest and enjoy slow cooked ribs and brisket etc.. Whole different world.  FYI I got my pro 500 for $1699 new in March. Which is a great deal if you like kicking yourself in the butt. The infrared burner is useless outside of late spring/summer etc.. The food is cooling while its cooking sorta thing due to elements and wind. And the finish it gives steaks sucks. Sear on charcoal way better. The grill on natural gas doesn't get that hot, you gotta crank all 4 burners and rotisserie to get it really hot.. Which doesn't do much at the grill level itself. Propane is hotter, and charcoal tray inside gets perfect hot.. But expect to have to wait for charcoal to burn out, as no way to kill oxygen to it like a real charcoal grill.  I am still debating giving it back, it's has 2-3 problems with it and the store that sold it to me has agreed to take it back.  The motion sensor on led lights doesn't work  The unit wouldn't heat up properly previously. Was repaired seems ok now.  The lid thermometer is completely off. Like 100-75deg off lol.  Some design annoyances are the hooks are on the side.. You want them on the front. In summer the handle gets so hot it'll almost take your skin off your hand.. Has burned me twice in last two days.  Yea the doors soft close.. And yea the lights are cool. But whatever. And rotisserie is ok, but takes a long time so be prepared.  I bought because my friend has a 825 and he loves it. And probably makes the best steak I have ever.. As in better than Nobu in Monaco good. But high heat sear and slow cooks it for 2 hrs... Flipping often, madness of a method. But very tasty steak."

One is the infrared side burner! Second are the stainless steel grates. Everything else I feel Weber is better at. The igniters suck on mine. My old POS bbq would start no problem in any weather. I have to sit there and click each burner several times to get them to light.  Also note I bought this thing used. Although I just recently replaced the whole valve assembly. The bbq actually starts much better now than before but still have to screw around.

935,Napoleon BBQ - Extreme Saving Events - Up to $150 Mail Rebate - Effective May 15 - July 4,"I had my pro665rsibpss-3 delivered to me on april 28th. The first time seasoning the grill (heating the grill for 30-40 min, letting it cool until cold) i turned it on preheat from cold for15 and started my wings once it hit smoking temp of 275f. Halfway though cooking I thought to myself what a POS grill. It doesn't even heat evenly. With the front lid open the rear will stay hot while the front is warm.  Called up napoleon figuring I might had a bad grill assembly They suggested to try the wings again but preheat the grill until it hits 500f and let it hold for 10 min, then lower heat to hit target temp. Second cook was way more successful. Extremely even heating, no scorching/flare up at all even when cooking extremely fatty sausage on direct heat. Build quality is top notch. Chose it because of the features such as smoker tray, and my fav part made in canada.  I'm probably 10 cooks into it with burgers, smoked salmon indirectly, naked smoked wings, steaks, each cook getting better. One thing I noticed with this grill if you have the lid open during your cook for burgers, this 3k monstrosity cooks like trash. Close the lid and you get extremely even cooking. Tried the bread test and surprisingly even pattern.  Cleanup tray on the pro665 is awesome. The tray essentially empties the bottom of the cook box. Before i put thr grill to use an application of automotive ceramic coating to the outside/inside parts was done. Made cleanup a breeze as food remnants fly off."

Hot in the back and the center, like the shape of a letter T.  No heat in the front.  1/6 of the front space is a cool zone.  I asked them about it and they said I should clean it....ya it was like that since day 1. They changed the design since, so it should be better. The side burner cooking grate is cast iron.  It cracked and they replaced it under warranty just after I purchased it. Then the new one rusted after using it just once and I even seasoned it. They said I have to bring it inside after cooking. WTF? who brings the BBQ grate inside after cooking? I emailed them 5 days ago because the the drip pan is rusted out and have holes now. They haven't responded yet."

Its a safety block put in in the event you have a major leak. You reset it by turning off the gas and the ball falls back into open position. Opening the propane tank too quickly can cause this issue too. Had an entry level napoleon before and ran into the same issue."

Came from a Weber summit s620 that was nothing but issues. Cookbox rotted out, blew out with wind constantly, had to tie doors together or they flung open in the wind, the stainless doors started to rust... The Weber could never get north of 550 degrees. The Napoleon is at 700+ in 10 mins. The build quality is much better than the summit. Everything is more sturdy. The Napoleon presidents warranty shouldn't be overlooked either.  Don't forget the prestige line is made in Barrie. Support local businesses. I also got the dealer down to $2500 with delivery. Regular price is $3049 for natural gas."
950,Napoleon BBQ - Extreme Saving Events - Up to $150 Mail Rebate - Effective May 15 - July 4,"Just throwing my 2 cents here - based on some comments. Disclosure: own Prestige Pro 500 Grillhead.  Propane will ALWAYS burn hotter than NG - this is not an issue with Napoleon but with all manufactures. There's a learning curve to go from Propane to NG - combat it with using the lid and some more patience. If you cook in the dead of winter then ya, the extra burn of propane will be better. I've learned to use the lid more and I love it for that fact. Also, Charcoal will always be better(taste) to cook on = don't compare it to a NG BBQ - irrelevant point as they are different methods. Best reason to go NG is convenience and time vs charcoal.  That said - there's a number of things to like about the pro 500. The build quality is very good. The oven capability is excellent as the lid is heavy duty - so underrated and I wish more people would talk about it. I've not had any hot spots but I think most BBQ's will vary in this category. The internal lighting system is fantastic. Just make sure you clean the glass every so often as it can gum up with oils. The rear burner work wonders as well (just cooked amazing two-pronged whole chickens which the family devoured. One critical point: I wanted to be more assured about the auto-ignition - I agree with other posters that its works, but you'll have to ensure there's some fed-gas in the chamber before you continue to twist. You do get the hand of it after a while.  Its a great BBQ, and I'd rather comment on the Napoleon Pro itself rather than the virtues of different cooking methods. Note that as a grill head I cannot comment about the quality of the side infrared burner. Edited: typo"

952,Napoleon BBQ - Extreme Saving Events - Up to $150 Mail Rebate - Effective May 15 - July 4,"I own a pro500rsib and it's by far the best BBQ I've ever owned and used. The side burner cooks and Sears beautifully. If anything, it gets too hot, not too cold. Those who state it isn't hot enough perhaps has defect? I placed a cast iron on top of the grates literally in the dead of winter at -20C and it was hot enough to stir fry. Grill top cooks pretty evenly. Rotisserie works fantastic. In terms of heat, it takes a good 10 minutes to build it to 500 degrees. Rarely does any recipe call for such high temperatures though. Everything is well built, top notch materials."

957,Napoleon BBQ - Extreme Saving Events - Up to $150 Mail Rebate - Effective May 15 - July 4,"I own a Weber Genesis and a Napoleon Prestige. I have owned multiple versions of both. I fix BBQs as a hobby.  Both are excellent. Both get very hot. Both have uniform heat signatures. Both will last you a long time. Both are excellent buys.  Napoleon is the only one made in North America (Barrie ON) (prestige, not lower end models). It uses higher grate stainless steel (304 - hint: if a magnet sticks to it it has more iron and will rust faster).  The infrared burner is great for searing but don’t let cold water hit it when it’s hot as the ceramic might crack.  Weber has easier availability of relatively cheaper parts. The old Genesis 1s were still built in North America but now it’s all China.  Otherwise they are basically equal and you won’t regret either."

Definitely a learning curve from propane and this grill needs to be ""understood"", each session is getting better and better."

But then again I do like the idea of stainless steel infrared side burner grate... Yeah, the Ambiance should be eligible for the MIR as well since it's just an upgraded P500, but pure $ off, the regular is better is better. Basically, if you don't think you'll want to upgrade the side burner and warming rack to SS now or in the future, best to go with the regular and save the $70+tax difference. Just thought I'd pass it along though because if SS is important, not sure you'd be able to upgrade it for $70 or less."

After looking at both I think the only major differences are the stainless steel is higher quality, and grids are 9.5mm vs. 7.5mm. There's also a grill light on the pro. Ice bucket and cutting board are moot as you could just put an external one on the non-pro very easily. Rep at BBQ store said the light knobs are made for california and useless in Vancouver... they won't even deal with them anymore.  I ended up going with the LEX485 at costco. Almost all the same features as the pro, 1 less burner, crappier stainless, older model... but for what I need I'll take the $1000 savings. I'll have to buy a rotissirie spit, but that's minimal."

Never had a single issue with it. Having said that, I've been using a NH-D15 since building my main rig with Ryzen 7 about 2.5 years ago. Biggest issue with the D15 is that it covers the 1st ram slot on my mobo so have to use the 2nd and 4th slots instead. I'm lucky with the case that I have because a few mm more and I won't be able to close the glass side panel so it's a consideration you have to take into account if you want to buy the D15. It is a massive hsf. I'm the lazy type when in comes to maintenance of the hsf so fans are the only one I have to look out for which I can clearly see through the glass side panel. Running a 1800+ at 4.1 Ghz all the time and according to hwmonitor, it maxes at 65 deg when running cinebench. Will be updating soon when zen3 comes out and will still use the D15 on new system as $200 is too much for cooling, at least for me, which can go towards better hardware upgrades. edit: The reason the D15 covers the 1st ram slot is because the G.Skill ram modules that I use have a tall heatspreaders.

Theoretically speaking, these things don't lower the temperature of the CPU by introducing something cooler like liquid nitrogen, but more so ""move"" the heat. A closed loop water cooler theoretically moves heat better than a typical cpu heatsink/fan combo (custom being the best in class), due to being able to take heat energy further away as well as being more flexible when it comes to where the heat is directed. Theoretically, they all can only remove certain amount of heat and no more because it's all dependent on the air temperature around you. Efficiency of the fan is important (so is the conductivity of the materials). But I think, if you can add Noctua fans to an AIO, you'll get something slightly better than what Noctua alone can offer. Again, that's not saying that all AIO have as polished of a quality as Noctua CPU coolers. Thermodynamics is one hell of a course."

The best air cooler’s peak performance is only as good as an average 240mm AIO in thermal performance and no, GamersNexus is not just a random reddit commenter.  Most comments regarding performance seem to be around Asetek AIOs which have lagged behind severely in recent years. This Corsair H115i happens to be an Asetek design.  The new EK AIO and Arctic Liquid Freezer II are noticeably better performing AIOs at lower temps and noise levels.  I’m all for the convenience and worry free-ness of an air cooler over an AIO hence why I purchased a DRP4 over a 280/360 AIO but at the same time I know I’ve given up lower temps and higher boost clocks in favour of a peace of mind. With that in mind, can we stop making every AIO sale thread an air cooler superiority complex discussion? Objectively, AIOs are better performing coolers, can be put in much smaller cases and if you care about looks and want to place a Funko Pop figurine in your case and upload it to the PCMasterRace subreddit, go ahead and spend your money as you will."

1054,Sony WH1000XM3/B Premium Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones - Black | $329.99,I have a pair - They are dope - Chose these over Bose as the noise cancelling was better imo.  But i mean to everyone their own. One thing they don't advertise as well is the clarity when having a wireless call. The inbuilt mic is amazing.  I might pick up a second pair for my dad.
1055,Sony WH1000XM3/B Premium Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones - Black | $329.99,"good price. i personally prefer the bose qc35. phyiscal on/off switch makes turning it on/off and pairing easier (saves like 1 second each time which isn't much but im a lazy mofo) being able to connect to 2 devices at the same time is EXTREMELY convenient if you use the headphone with exactly 2 devices. if you use it on 3, you have to do the same thing anyway. i use it with my computer and phone so not having to go through the settings and connecting through bluetooth each and every time is very nice. the bose are very slightly more comfortable. it just fits better with the perfect amount of pressure for my head. the xm3 feels like it will fall right off with any significant movement (although i never move my head enough when i wear them for this to be a real issue) and i feel more pressure on the top of my head for extended periods. the creaking from the sony headband is concerning although never amounted to anything over the couple years i've used them. bose customer service is AMAZING imo. they're super friendly, responsive, and give you a huge discount as long as you've owned their product to buy a new one if your old ones has run its course. had a pair with 1 year warranty. used it for ~4 years and it finally started breaking from just age and use and they gave me something like a 60-70% discount for a new one. sony looks much sleeker (looks matter to me) the touch controls are nicer than the physical buttons of the bose imo. the sound quality/signature is significantly better and more fun imo. and the noise cancelling is slightly better. TL;DR Sony has slightly better sound/noise cancelling/looks. bose has FAR better convenience and for me, the main reason i want a bluetooth headphone is for the convenience."
1056,Sony WH1000XM3/B Premium Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones - Black | $329.99,"If you want a multi Bluetooth connection then wait for the series 4. But if you don’t then this price is insane imo. I have the version 2 and this is the best headphones I ever owned in my life. Not a Sony fan, but I’m a fan of amazing products"
1057,Sony WH1000XM3/B Premium Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones - Black | $329.99,"Sony for the sound, anc, multiple bt code supported, longer battery life. Bose for the comfort, way better and can wear for hours and even fall asleep, dual device support. Look wise I do like Sony but bose is more conservative/ so preferred used in a work environment as people may thought you just use a headphone for call, but Sony stands out as a fancy good looking music earphone  Control wise some user reported Sony’s touch control is not responsive during winter time. Bose is the old fashioned, but also there is user report on power button issue (turn on device on itself after 2-3 years usage) seems physical problem.  Bose latest firmware is rumoured to have anc issue, but they went thru a detailed examination and claim everything is fine, and allow user to the downgrade FM. I don’t know if anc is indeed nerfed, but I feel their customer support takes it seriously. The best CR i dealer with is Bose and Jabra. Sony, oh well, good luck. Sony earlier also had some complaint on the FM on nerfed Anc, but anc is very objective, even Airpod pro had the same fm problem earlier this year  Price wise, with new Xm4 coming, xm3 may further drop, and specs show not a lot of changes. For Bose, newer version 700 was out last year but many customer still prefer the old qc35ii as new one was not as comfortable and can’t not fold, anc improvement is not huge (their mic has improved a lot for call quality) So I don’t expect qc35ii would further drop price soon.  At same price, if one doesn’t put comfort at first priority, Sony would be a better option.  If one want to save some money, wait for bose has refurbished qc35i, $250-200, quality is good and everything is almost the same as Qc35ii, only difference is no anc adjust/smart assistant button+plain packaging, but they have 30days return window."

1060,Sony WH1000XM3/B Premium Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones - Black | $329.99,"I tested both the Bose and Sony headphones a while back and the Bose noise cancelling gave me a vicious headache within seconds. I now have both this and the in ear WF version and have had no problems with them. Mind you, I seem to be spending most of my time using them in video conferences."

These headphones offer Adaptive Sound Control.  This means that, if it's turned on, the headphones will modify the type of noise cancellation depending on your location and movement. If your sitting still you hear just the source your listening to.  If you're moving about, the headphones will allow external sound to be heard, so you're aware of things going on around you. I've sometimes noticed some hiss as it switches between full and partial noise cancellation, but only sometimes."

Just to make sure. These headphones had a momentary hiss or maybe something similar to going into a tunnel (for a few seconds) when switching to the ambient mode (partial ANC) the first time. I tried to reproduce it but it only happened the first time after power on. Listening to music with quiet sections or even when one song ends and another begins is completely silent (ANC on or off). I should be able to hear it, if there's a hiss, I've had my hearing tested and apparently I can hear upper frequencies quite well."

Strange - maybe just a temporary issue? I’ve had no problems with any of the Esso GC’s purchased from UGO and added to Speedpass+. Only annoying part is that if you have a price privileges discount card, it deducts the discount AFTER the pump stops at the gift card amount...so you end up with 20 cents on the GC. Just have to go pay in store to use up all these left over amounts on the gift cards."

If that doesn’t work for you then 1. try after 24 from the last successful or unsuccessful attempt. 2. If using Apple Pay then avoid and add card info directly. 3. Try using a different card if you’ve tried apple and no apple way of paying using the same card. 4. Lastly, if none of this works then try creating a new account of ugo and pay with same card. The card that you’re using, is it used for international transactions? Was there a fraudulent charge that was reported by you in the past or did you dispute a charge on it in the past. I support the fact that this shouldn’t in anyway matter the ugo app if you have a credit and you’re in good standing but all I am trying to do here is finding a successful way for the unsuccessful attempts made by fellow rfders so far."

It’s more for running games directly off it where as passport is more for store and go purposes where you mostly read from it but rarely write on it (at least not big files such as save files for games). If you are using it for gaming or do a lot of “writing” to the drive (lots of file transfer that for whatever reason you don’t do via network), then it might be worth it.

It was also a good one to use when I was also on the ketogenic diet since it had no sugar (new formula has a little bit now). As someone said, it does help to have a little taste to just plain water.  I still do have some tablets lying around and use them if I feel the need to hydrate, having the minimal sugar and carbs does help."
1374,Nuun electrolyte tablets,This was 50 bucks a few weeks ago. Now a bit lower. Not sure if Walmart or Canadian tire will price match Linen Chest without having to pull their leg and go thru much rigamarole. Not sure how good it is but reviews are okay. I might grab one. Edit. Amazon.ca same price.

1377,Magic the Gathering Sale,$10 for 2 booster packs? Isn't that a bad deal? When I used to play a few years ago you'd buy into FNM for $10 and get 3 packs essentially. And if you go to any independent game store you can usually get a pack for $5. What am I missing?

1380,Magic the Gathering Sale,"Galaxy S20+ 5G Dual Sim model from Hong Kong with Snapdragon processor. Shipping is $25.99 and it takes several weeks. You won't be able to use Samsung Pay. Still, this is a great price if you prefer a dual sim model that has the Snapdragon processor and does 5G.  The non plus S20 is $920.  In April, an Ebay seller was selling the non-5G Exynos dual sim model for $699 USD which worked out to be about $960 before taxes and $60 customs fee."

Which will save me more money? Buy from Google or Koodo?"
