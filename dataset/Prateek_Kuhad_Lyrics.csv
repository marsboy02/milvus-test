100 words,"[Verse 1]
Five am trains
And broken chains
I called you every afternoon
Forrest Gump
And the hurricane trails
Though we never followed through
[Chorus]
Do you have a 100 words for me?
'Cause I have only three
And you couldn’t even sing for me
And I keep on writing these songs
Over and over
And I keep getting closer to you
[Verse 2]
A lover’s home
Is never shown
It’s never known, to the common folk
You called me over
Said my name three times over
But you never looked me in the eyes
[Chorus]
Do you have a 100 words for me?
'Cause I have only three
And you couldn’t even sing for me
And I keep on writing these songs
Over and over
And I keep getting closer, to you
[Chorus]
Do you have a 100 words for me?
'Cause I have only three
And you couldn’t even sing for me
And I keep on writing these songs
Over and over
And I keep getting closer, to you
And I keep on writing these songs
Over and over
As I keep getting older, with you"
A Shot of Alcohol,"I'm, a shot of alcohol for you
The scary monster in your dreams
A cigarette lighter when you're blue
I'm the broken guitar you threw away
The pretty song you never made
I'm the last step of your ruse
Your eyes in mine, by the fire under the moonlight
I have tried, to stare back into your reflection
I thought you'd never say goodbye
That you'd be with me when I cry
But I'm just another one of your
Free times, free times"
Ab Hoga Kya,"Hazaaron ishaare karoon bhi to kya hai
Paheli, paheli, paheli, paheli hai woh
Hazaaron ishaare karoon bhi to kya hai
Paheli, Paheli, Paheli, Paheli hai woh
Aayi hai kahaan se
Jaayegi kahaan ye koi na jaane
Akeli-akeli hai woh
Rog kaisa hai ye
Har saans mein
Dil mein mere ab hoga kya
Josh kaisa hai ye mann main mere
Ab hoga kya
Ho ho ho
Jaane ab hoga kya
Ho ho ho
Jaane ab hoga kya
Ho ho ho
Jaane ab hoga kya
Ab hoga kya
Anokha sa pal hai
Alag sa nasha hai
Ye kismat hai meri
Akela-akela hoon main door se aayi hai
Gehri hai kahaani nayi hai
Anokhi nishaani hai ye
Rog kaisa hai ye
Har saans mein
Dil mein mere ab hoga kya
Josh kaisa hai ye
Mann main mere
Ab hoga kya
Ho ho ho
Jaane ab hoga kya
Ho ho ho
Jaane ab hoga kya
Ho ho ho
Jaane ab hoga kya
Ab hoga kya"
All I Need,"[Verse 1]
Would you break away
If I tied my heartstrings to you, baby?
And every day
I wanna see your perfect body right beside me, baby
[Chorus]
I want you to know that I did try
To open your heart and break in inside
I want you to know that I believe
I'd heal all your wounds and take all your tears
'Cause, baby, you're all I need
[Verse 2]
Do you believe?
I wanna love you like the storm that lives inside me, baby
Pull me deep in your sea
I wanna swim through your veins
I wanna move through you, baby
[Chorus]
I want you to know that I did try
To open your heart and break in inside
I want you to know that I believe
I'd heal all your wounds and take all your tears
'Cause, baby, you're all I need
[Post-Chorus]
Baby, you're all I need
Yeah, baby, you're all I need
[Chorus]
I want you to know that I did try
To open your heart and break in inside
I want you to know that I believe
I'd heal all your wounds and take all your tears
'Cause, baby, you're all I need
[Outro]
Baby, you're all I need
Baby, you're all I need
Baby, you're all I need
And I could be all you need"
Artist,"She thinks of herself
As an artist
She walks to the show
Like a queen
Her demeanour is slick
And she can turn you down with a flick of her fingers
If she feels it
She thinks of herself
As a lady
She walks by the aisle
With grace
Her hair flows down her neck
And she might even give you a peck on your lips
If she feels it
She thinks of herself
As an artist
Ooooh, she’s an artist"
Be at Ease,"I'm glaring wildly at traces of love
Staring blankly at signs from above
Breathe under the sun, living without kin or kith
We are all looking for someone to be at ease with
And wined and dined, a trollop at nine
Believe it or not, she’s doing fine
Often, everything that we know turns out a myth
We are all looking for someone to be at ease with
Ease, to be at ease
To be at ease
To be at ease
A drop of luck, a pinch of fate
Lift your heart, it’s never too late
Sow your blood, reap your flesh, hold steady your scythe
We are all looking for someone to be at ease
And we are all looking for someone to be at peace"
Big Suprise,"This house, it breathes tonight
We are, the blood and veins, we took the reins
For now, the time has come
It's not a big surprise
We fought, in many wars
We proved our love, we proved our faith
For now, it's gone, I know it's wrong
It's not a big surprise
So sleep
Sleep tight, tonight
You know
Tomorrow will be bright
I know it's cold
My hands are warm
My heart is strong
It's not a big surprise
There are a thousand dreams
That lie within the sheets, in old LPs
For now, they lie asleep
It's not a big surprise
We smoke our breath away, this foggy night
Foresight is not on our side
It's not the pain, that's on my mind
It's just the big surprise
So sleep
Sleep tight, tonight
You know
Tomorrow will be bright
I know it's cold
My hands are warm
My heart is strong
It's not a big surprise"
Bloom,"[Verse 1]
I know love when I see it bloom
I know feelings when I see them in a room
Yeah, they just need me and you
I keep waiting for you even when you tell me I'm a loon
[Chorus]
Don't you see? Time and time, I fail
And lately, I've been talking to myself again
[Verse 2]
A bit too much, but it isn't fair
'Cause I don't have your eyes to stare into
I dare you to compare your embrace to anywhere
I still need you, I don't care
[Chorus]
Don't you know? I've been on my own far too long
If you're on your way, I'll stick around
[Verse 3]
I couldn't sleep and now I can
I still need to feel your touch and hold your hands
Yeah, I want you all around me
I keep it in, but I write it down
[Chorus]
Don't you know I've been on my own far too long?
If you're on your way I'll stick around"
Chahe Ya Na Chahe,"Tere sapno ke baadal pe
Sundar sama hai mehfil jawan
Hawaaon ne cheekha hai shaamil bhi shaam
Mukaddar Sikandar ka bhi maan'na hai
Ke mera chhota sa ghar hai yahaan
Tu chahe ya na chahe jaan
Jo parde uthe tu kahan main yahin hu
Main karvate badalta hu sota nahin hu
Tu sapno ki raani main raaton ka raaja
Tu bholi kahaani, main aandhi ka waada
Hai kiski ye marzi ye kisne likha
Tu chahe ya na chahe jaan
Tu chahe ya na chahe jaan
Tu chaahe ya na chaahe jaan
Aaja samaa mein taare na dekhe
Honsh udaane waale raahein na milein
Rakth hi rahe laal siyaahi ki cheethi
Bheege kagaz ka adhura soona fasana
Hai laal, neeli, peeli ye mann ki tarangein
Sab hanste hai mujhpe
Phir jalte sabhi hain
Hawaaon ne cheekha hai shaamil bhi shaam
Mukaddar Sikandar ka bhi maan'na hai
Ke mera chhota sa ghar hai yahaan
Tu chaahe ya na chaahe jaan
Tu chaahe ya na chaahe jaan
Tu chaahe ya na chaahe jaan"
Co2,"[Verse 1]
Maybe I was wrong and you were right
But I don't really wanna have this fight
I just wanna feel like I belong
And every time my heart swings back to you
You are my morning and my truth
And all that I can do is sing this song
It ain't that long, hm
[Chorus]
And nothing says ""I love you"" like your eyes
Fill my lips with carbon dioxide
I just wanna feel like I deserve you
'Cause you deserve me
Baby, it's the way that you can see
What I miss and what I can never be
I just wanna feel like I deserve you
'Cause you deserve me
[Verse 2]
Maybe you were wrong and I was right
I don't care, won't you stay another night?
I just need some time to be myself
I couldn't say ""I need you"" on that night
When you left and I lost all track of time
I just want you close so I can feel you
Can you feel me? Mm
[Chorus]
And nothing says ""I love you"" like the words
That were never said, but could be heard
If only there was peace around us, baby
You would hear me
And maybe it's the way that lovers do
I just want for me what I want for you
Only with the sun above us maybe
You would see me
[Post-Chorus]
Mm, mm, mm
[Bridge]
And even if you leave, I may be fine
'Cause my heart, it has its own design
And even if you never see it, baby
You're all that I need"
Cold Shoulders,"We crossed our desires, we crossed our eyes
In tokens, in charms, in smoke, in kind
We spent it all
We buried our cause
We straightened our spine
Swayed and fettered, swooned and crowned
Even the bliss is pain somehow
I read up on glances and tethered to chances
Eloped with the sounds
How did you perceive me
How did you complete me
Cold shoulders apart
Sway into my arms
Slip into my heart
I stumbled with grace in my stride
I cordoned my hopes to one side
I slipped on my swerves
I balanced on curves
I slowed down my ride
Oh when you were faded, you looked away
When you were spoken, when you refrained
I called in my favours
I called in my troops
I left you alone
Tired of being only
The rain, the sun, the lonely
Cold shoulders apart
Sway into my arms
Slip into my heart"

When I feel cold
I’ll keep you close
And if I could hold you
And take you home

When at night
Your toes touch mine
I’ll sing you to sleep
If you were mine to keep
[Chorus]
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart, is a mess
My days they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
With your breath

To sway just like
It was Friday night
And all the lights
Will blind me dry

Hmm-mmm-mmm
Hmm-mmm-mmm

Then, someone told me my mind is a mess
That someone was you, you know it too

Hmm-mmm-mmm

And then we slipped and our hearts, they stood still

Darling darling, hmm-mmm-mmm
It’s just morning, hmm-mmm-mmm

So baby, hold me close
And feel me with your toes
Your lips an overdose
Yeah, I said goodbye I know

Love is a conqueror, love is a friend
She bites really hard, that’s all I can tell
Everyone falls and I know we will too
With love in our eyes, it's all we can do

It’s just morning, kiss me some more
So, darling darling, don’t let me go

Kiss me some more, kiss me some more

Drown  Audiotree Live Version,"And all of my heart is broken
But the salt of my wounds
Will never follow you around
I will never make a sound
And taking every step in fear
If only you could hold me close
This time I think I'm bound to stay alone
And last night was the first time
We inched close to cyanide
Our blood red as beetroot tonight
Can show you the skies, they felt orange
They held me in service
Just whisper my name
I'll never let you go
Baby, can you hold me close please
And tell me all your stories
So I can sleep in peace
Baby, can you whisper my name?
I could never swim in sorrows
But tomorrow always follows
So I tie up my lips for you, babe
Silently, we break our key, see?
Can we open doors?
Shyly find me, wine me kindly
Kiss me as I drown, as I drown
And as I drown, and as I drown
And as I drown, and as I drown
And as I drown, and as I drown
And as I drown, and as I drown
And if only your love could hold me
If your arm switches and fold me
I would tie up my lungs for you baby
As I drown, and as I drown
And as I drown, and as I drown
As I drown, and as I drown

Face,"[Verse 1]
Time is just a place that we never wanna disgrace
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I thought this could be the one time that I escape
But nothing really seems to change with the sunrise
[Chorus]
I felt always like a fool, if only I could lose me
Leave me clueless in my shoes so nothing can confuse me
All I needed was a touch of sazeracs that choose me
Leave me naked in my clothes with the folks that always usе me
[Verse 2]
But maybe this is just a game and I nеver knew how to play it
I just wanna face it all with my shut eyes now
Maybe I try my luck and take a peek
All I wanna see is miles of blue skies now
[Chorus]
I stay in just to contain the thoughts that do consume me
I just wanted to stay sane, why do I think I'm vain please
All I needed was the love of sazeracs to snooze me
Leave me naked to my soul and him and me will soon sleep
[Verse 3]
Stripped down to my glass nerves, they crack in a split
So I can see my blood move as it slips right out
I could sing this once, twice, thrice, and again, but maybe
This can only end with my knees and my tongue tied down
[Chorus]
I thought this would be the one time that I escape
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes
I just wanna face the world with my shut eyes"
Favorite Peeps,"[Verse 1]
I slept with my toes between all my sheets
It feels like I never could really keep up
With all of my hands and all of my feet
I need all the warmth I can get from my
Favorite peeps, I keep them around
I have to stay strong, but I wanna give up
[Verse 2]
My fire is strong, but sometimes I leap
Into the pits of imaginary slumps
With my new kicks that I never picked
I need all the heart I can get from my
Favorite loves, I need them with me
I should stay strong, but I wanna give up
[Bridge]
It's just love, lust, then lonely, no time to be alone
Don't know what I have, but I want what I don't
May slip, slit my wrist with a call on my phone
Don't know what I need, what I have, I don't see
They said, ""give time"" (Timе)
(Time) Time
(Time) timе
[Verse 3]
They take me around, they tuck me to sleep
They keep me in check when I wanna break in
To my own self, within my debris
I need all the hugs I can get from my
Favorite bugs, they need me too
I need to stay strong, so I don't let them know

fighter,"And I have been fighting for you
Open wounds and loose smiles, for you
I could have been another friend
Or I could pretend
Could you open your doors?

Or would you fall with me love

It's red as wine, I'll shine, you'll see
It's open and close
I'm fine, believe me
These cold and empty skies, you'll see
My fingers will hold your hand, believe me

Fire,"Oh, would you call me a liar
If I told you my love, had no end
Oh, would you call me a liar
If I told you my love, had no beginning

We were just not aware
We were folding our jeans
To step into the salty sea
Let the sand stick to our toes
Until we fall asleep
Oh, would you call me a liar
Oh, would you call me a liar
Oh, would you call me a liar
Oh, would you call me a liar
Oh, can you hold my fire, for me"

My only find is you
And all my time is you
Before i try to bleed
Before my soul does sleep

So I beg you
To be mine"

Go,"[Verse 1]
Don't leave me hanging sideways
We are drunk and driving highways
And our bodies are inclined

We are hidden behind these sheets that never end

If you leave, I won't even show it now
If you go, I won't even know now
If you leave, I won't even show it now

I did try to be your lover
It was beautiful under covers
And our bodies were inclined
We are wasted in our youth and
We are spent and we are clueless
Did we question our souls?

We are hidden behind these window sills
We are hidden behind these sheets that never end

Yeah, I've been heartbroken

My breath is heavy with you
And all my nights are soaked in

Your touch
It's a crutch
Just this once
Let it burn

Sing this, baby, dance with me
This song is all that hides in me
Like a slingshot splits me in two
Strong as dusky whiskey in you

This love hurts
Let it burst
Just slay me
Just taste me

I glance with sunlight this limelight
You fortified me with your eyes
Like wine, my hands fly your body tonight
So stay, please, by my side

Let this be the last time
Let your hands stay in mine
I won't sleep or let you
Until your lips slide in minе

My love
Can we burn?
Just this once
Can wе burn?
Just this once
Can we burn?"
Held You Tight,"I hold my breath and
Slow my heart beat when
You console me
Babe you showed me the light
When I’m lonely
When I’m over the edge
Babe you fool me
Babe you showed me the light
I have held you tight
Could not open my eyes
I have held you tight
Could not open my eyes
I pride myself in
Knowing you so well
But you know me
Babe you showed me the light
In my heartache
In my lonesome time
Babe you found me
Babe you showed me the light
I have held you tight
Could not open my eyes
I have held you tight
Could not open my eyes"
Holding On,"It was shown and behold her hair was golden
Her eyes were blue, as the sea was bold
And free
Her eyes were bold and free
We grew with the town, we laughed and we frowned
Our eyes withdrawn, but our hearts were bold
And free
Our hearts were bold and free
We walked with our shadows behind us and close
We danced with our bodies with me
Holding on to you
And you holding on to me
We painted the sky, with blues of a thousand kinds
We were fools, for the moon was ahead all this while
The moon was ahead all the time
So broken and done, our souls and our bones
May be old and sore, but our eyes they shone like the sun
Our eyes they shone like the sun
We walked with our shadows behind us and close
We danced with our bodies with me
Holding on to you
And you holding on to me"

[Verse 1]
I closed my eyes, I let the fire burn
I meant to stay, I meant to call her
[Refrain]
We said goodbye, we made it harder
We said we'll fight, we made it harder
[Verse 2]
We opened our eyes and it was cold out
We kept our needs, we kept our ghosts out
I wept the night, I wept my heart out
I felt my skin roll up and roll down
[Refrain]
We said goodbye, we madе it harder
We said we’ll fight, wе made it harder
[Instrumental Break]
[Refrain]
We said goodbye, we made it harder
We said we'll fight, we made it harder
[Outro]
Who did you find? Who did you follow?
I stayed up late, I waited for you
Who did you find? Who did you follow?
I stayed up late, I waited for you"
Hopelessly Live at Soundcheck,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, nothing felt safer
So silently we fall
I wrote it on paper
'Cause it's all I've really got
[Chorus]
And you, you have me hopelessly in love
And you, you have me hopelessly in love
[Verse 2]
I wanna believe you
But the pain comes in the way
I don't wanna leave you
But all the signs, they point away
[Chorus]
And you, you have me hopelessly in love
And you, you have me hopelessly in love
[Bridge]
Believe me, you complete me
Feel me, can you heal me?
Yeah, I need you close, I need to belong
I feel so confined, I won’t carry on
We sleep under stars, embrace on our knees
Look into my heart, I need you to see
[Verse 3]
I wanna believe you
But the pain comes in the way
I don't wanna leave you
But darling, I need to walk away
[Chorus]
And you, you have me hopelessly in love
And you, you have me hopelessly in love
'Cause you, you have me hopelessly in love
And you, you have me hopelessly in love"
Into the Night,"[Verse 1]
When I was young, I could tell between the moon and the stars
And I would hold my breath underwater for a minute and a half
You came along, to be my baby
And then you came along, to be my darlin'
[Verse 2]
Love, when did I learn to be perfectly fine
With the wind in my hair and the cold of my feet was gone? Then you came along to be my baby, love
Then you came along to be my darling
[Chorus]
It was love before I even held your hands
It was love and I could tell that I was weak in the knees
And so we danced our time away into the night
[Verse 3]
I thought I was born in a jungle but I was born
In a palace of green and I couldn’t stay
Another night without holding my knees between yours
Another night without feeling your lips on mine
[Verse 4]
Baby if they call me a failure, you could be my prize
If my life is a joke, you could be my smile
Another home, another land, another city
If it means that I could be a better man in your eyes
[Chorus]
It was love before I even held your hands
It was love and I could tell that I was weak in the knees
And so we danced our time away into the night
[Chorus]
It was love before I even held your hands
It was love and I could tell that I was weak in the knees
And so we danced our time away into the night"
Just a Word,"[Verse 1]
Am I the one that you want?
Maybe it's time to let me know
Picking me up from the floor
Maybe it's time to let me go
[Pre-Chorus]
Did you see me and feel me?
Did your body deceive me?
Can you heal me
Before our lips entwine?
Can this be painless?
And blameless with all our insaneness
Our grip tightens, we fight it from inside, mhm
[Chorus]
Yeah, it was just a word, but we never let it hurt us
Tryna find a world where this love really dеserves us
Yeah, baby, I am waiting if you lеt me know, yeah
It was just word, but we never let it hurt us
[Verse 2]
Just one of those times
We couldn't let our feelings show
Need you from nine to nine
I want you more than you could know
[Pre-Chorus]
Did you see me and feel me?
Did your body deceive me?
Can you heal me
Before our lips entwine?
Can this be painless?
And blameless with all our insaneness
Our grip tightens, we fight it from inside, mhm
[Chorus]
Yeah, it was just a word, but we never let it hurt us
Tryna find a world where this love really deserves us
Yeah, baby, I am waiting if you let me know, yeah
It was just word, but we never let it hurt us"
Just to Be With You,"So, Why did you take my heart away
This love, just winter ahead
And even the chain couldn't keep but still
This love, maybe it will
This night will swallow our sin's

What i wouldn't do just to be with you
What i wouldn't do just to be with you
What i wouldn't do just to be with you"

Behold these eyes
Oh love it's time
Behold these eyes
There's a fire that burns
Inside my soul

Pause,"[Verse 1]
I can never speak in tunes before
But for you, I could write a symphony
If only you would sing alone

Is what I have enough for you?
Or do you need all the things that I don’t?
Separate all the lies from the truth
Picking up the pieces so
[Chorus 1]
Can we hide?
I need you close
Can we pause this moment
Keep it open, close?
Dance alone
And this time we'll split our hearts wide open
[Verse 2]
Yes, everything, it changes
But we still feel the sameness
Slip away as we fade away
Can you make me feel that you will never leave?
Will it ever be the same again?
We hold each other just to, stay in place
Maybe I'll just be the one to say
[Chorus 2]
Can we hide?
I need you close
Can we pause this moment
Keep it open, close?
Dance alone
And in time we’ll split our hearts wide open
Love, hold me close
Can we pause this moment
Keep it open?
No, Can we go home?
And this time we'll keep our hearts wide open"

Slipping through the doors

Waking up to the wet, morning shadows
