RL16ZWDRDNUEI,5.0 out of 5 stars Great product with usage caveats,Omar Enrique Ferrer,5,"A few months ago I had an epiphany. When I was a kid my father loved to have the best in sound equipment in the house, and I would play with graphic equalizers and lay in the floor looking for the best position between the giant speakers to experiment how to better enjoy the music.Today, I hear music in monophonic audio in an old JBL Charge 3 speaker (don't tell my dad, he would be ashame of me).So I started to get better equipment. Now, I live in a small apartment with thin walls in a 3rd floor, so, big amplifiers and so are out of the question, but at least I could get better bluetooth speakers, so I tried the Marshall Emberton II.To say that I impressed with the sound would be an understatement. With out-of-the-box settings, the sound is more than detailed. 80s and 90s music sound outstanding although, Peter Cetera's Glory of Love and Toto's Africa vocals sound as I never heard them before, they are sharp and strong, sometimes detracting just a little from the overall sound (keywords here, really, just a little).This brings me to my first recommendation: do not mess with your applications equalizers if you don't know what you are doing. This speakers were clearly designed to use the manufacturer equalizer settings (more on this later). I have youtube music and amazon prime music (yeah, I know, no spotify), and my sound with the latter was to heavy on bass, to the point of drowning the music and feeling almost distorting. Tron: Legacy's soundtrack sounded specially dreadful, as Daftpunk uses heavy bass in their electronic music for that specific music. I then set the equalization in Amazon Prime Music to flat. It was a different performance altogether. I could ever hear some slight effects they used, that I had not noticed before.Now, one down for the application. Bluetooth pairing used Google Fast Pair, which was seamless and impressive (it shows appears to be a custom Marshall little window, so, it looks cool), but the application takes forever to actually ""discover"" the device, even when it is already paired.When it finally discover it (which was not too long, but took a couple of turning on and off the speaker), the application notified me of a firmware upgrade, which I proceeded to install. The installation failed miserably, so, I temporarily stopped that effort, which I retook successfully a day later. The update was surprisingly big in size, taking around 5 minutes to download, and the application simply marked the update successful while the speaker was still rebooting, which took a few seconds more than what I feel comfortable with, but it went through, and after that, the application again took surprisingly long to detect the speaker.To end that topic, the equalization settings are definitely underwhelming, with only three modes: Marshall, Voice and Push, of which I have only tried Marshall as everybody else says that Voice is just for podcast and such and Push increases bass at the expense of all the other sound bands quality.Lesson learned: unless too picky, when using this speaker, leave your apps equalizers on flat, their profile is that good.Now, to the hardware itself, people will notice this little wonder. Using the nostalgia factor with the Marshall amplifier design was a touch of genius, and the brass button on top is the cherry on top. Some reviews complain about a single button approach to multifunction (power, volume, forward-back, bluetooth pairing has another almost invisible button, which fits because you are not changing your pairing frequently). If we can handle touch control on over-head and in-ear speakers, this button is a piece of cake.My only complain in this department is that, at least for me, an old guy, the signs indicating the functions around the button, being carved in the black speaker, which has texture, are for all intent and purposes invisible, but once you get accustomed, an use the logo as a positional reference that's not a problem anymore.And finally, the little caveat. Single speaker, stereo sound. Let that sink in.Done? Ok, they achieve this trick by separating the sound left and right with drivers back and front respectively (or was it the other way around? well, you get my point). Stereo suffers a little (not too much) because both sources are incredibly close, but it brings this caveat. This speaker should not be set as others, against walls, like in shelf, and so, because you end up drowning one side.The best position for this speaker is in the center of the audio stage, and if you want to appreciate the sound, you should point one side (not the front or back) to you. that way both sources are equally distanced from you so you get a better balance.If you are ok with the caveats this product is worth the price, I definitely recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2022",True,165,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,Marshall
R1WRMQNY9KE109,5.0 out of 5 stars Simple yet Wonderful,Sunny,5,"The Marshall Emberton is a testament to Marshall's commitment to quality and innovation. It seamlessly blends timeless design with cutting-edge technology, delivering a speaker that not only looks stunning but also sounds exceptional. The iconic Marshall logo adorns the front, paying homage to the brand’s heritage.Portability and Convenience: The Emberton’s compact size, weighing just 0.7 kilograms, makes it incredibly portable. Slip it into your bag or pocket, and you have a powerful sound system wherever you go.Sound Performance: Don’t be fooled by its size; the Emberton packs a punch. With two 10W drivers, it delivers a surprisingly rich and dynamic sound. The bass is deep and satisfying, the mids are clear, and the highs are crisp, offering a well-balanced audio experience. Even at high volumes, the sound remains distortion-free, showcasing Marshall’s commitment to audio excellence.In conclusion, the Marshall Emberton is a testament to Marshall’s engineering prowess. It defies its size, delivering a sound quality that rivals much larger speakers. Its robust build, impressive battery life, and excellent sound make it a top choice in the realm of portable Bluetooth speakers. Whether you’re a music enthusiast, a frequent traveller, or someone who values premium audio in a compact form, the Marshall Emberton is a stellar choice.","Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2023",True,24,Color: BlackStyle: Emberton,Marshall
RC13S2KIPGBVM,5.0 out of 5 stars Great quality product,Matthew M.,5,"This speaker really amazed me the sound it produced with such a small footprint.

RVQU04O5Y7EP5,4.0 out of 5 stars Rich sound - with the right music,Brett Williams,4,"What I liked most about this unit was the dual driver system where you can get a more stereo sound than other Bluetooth speakers that are more mono (unless you pair a few together). The battery lasting up to 30 hours is impressive, though I didn't just it more than a few hours and couldn't speak to what real-time is. The top metal multi-directional button is very nice and premium feel......however the textured top/rubber surround makes reading the Volume/Track directions virtually impossible to see - you get used to it, but it would be nice if they were a little more visible.I will say that I'm disappointed in 2024, we're still seeing devices with Bluetooth 5.1, considering that it was released in 2016 and 5.3 has been out since 2021.With the driver's front and back-firing, I found that I got a wider sound by turning the unit sideways so that I was looking at the side of the unit while the drivers fired left and right.I listen to just about anything, and other were songs where the speaker excelled, but then others where it sounded very flat, and it's because of the inconsistency that I returned it. I will say that I liked it much more than the JBL's that I tested against which had almost zero depth comparatively, but for a little more I got something that, while larger, has a better sound presence.I was tempted to keep this as an alternative, but I think over time I would probably get annoyed with some songs sounding flat and others very deep and rich (or course tracks and recording quality matter, but compared to other speakers I tested I didn't see as big of a swing between the same songs).","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024",True,4,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,Marshall

R3JMLBD2NPCVJ2,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Yet Bluetooth Speaker,Stephen R. Finney,5,"This Bluetooth is head an shoulders above any JBL, Altec, or Bose Bluetooth speaker I've yet heard. The bass while strong, is not ridiculous, and muffled. What blew my mind is that I could hear the snare on a drum! No Bluetooth speaker I've had before could make a snare drum sound right. The speaker also has great volume. I may have more to add once I've had it for a while, but as of this moment I'm genuinely impressed. I will be buying at least one for a present for a sibling. As of this moment I'm recommending this speaker to anyone wanting a moderately priced, great sounding Bluetooth speaker.","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2024",True,4,Color: CreamStyle: Emberton II,Marshall

R2F1V8M2I73X42,5.0 out of 5 stars Wow !,Karen Racanella,5,"What do I like about this Marshall Bluetooth Speaker? EVERYTHINGCompact size does not mean this speaker has compact sound. This speaker is all you need to sync your music with a clear, superior sound boost. I remember the Marshall amps for my punk rock days. This is a replica of the Marshall amps and that's one of the reasons I chose this speaker. Sound quality has not been sacrificed and it is easy to use. It's all you need. I purchased this a week ago and bought another for my son this week. I will most likely purchase one for my hubby because he is using mine all the time, and yes we have different tastes in music.

R13A8CEV5KJI8M,5.0 out of 5 stars So Cool...,John Farrell,5,"I visited a friend on Florida recently and he's building a new house. We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails, it won't be done until May 2024, and brought along his Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water. I don't seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker, but I was very impressed with the B&O speaker. It rocked. I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself. These things aren't cheap (the good ones anyway) so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales. The B&O software, that enables you to pair with their speaker, was a pain in the neck. They were hounding me and sending me e-mails and all the rest. I wanted another alternative. I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker. They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker. Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge. I think I got it on sale for around $120 when all was said and done. It showed up two day later. I pulled it out of the package, charged it up and paired it with my phone. Hate me (or them), but the first song I played with Help On The Way/Slipnot! from Blues For Allah (Grateful Dead). Wow. Absolutely loved the sound and the look. Down the road I will look into either ""stacking"" another one (they have that ability) or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting, but right now this thing rocks. If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music, this is for you. I'm impressed. I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max, but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works. I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice. That doesn't appear to be the case, but it's plenty loud enough in a vacuum. It's a starter speaker so I don't expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes, but I'm very satisfied short term. Buy with confidence.","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2024",True,3,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,Marshall

R1N4D4CK1JMIVB,4.0 out of 5 stars Three + 1/2 stars.,Sophie's6,4,"Feels churlish to give just three stars. 3.5 imo. So to the point. I bought this Em II to mainly listen to my true crime podcasts in my bedroom. Easy & seamless Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 14max. Easy straightforward use for controls on the unit. I really didn’t need to look at the instructions with that. Smooth use there.To test the sound quality I streamed some mesic. The sound quality for music is fine’ish considering the size of speaker. It’s fine for background music if you’re flexible on sound quality as long as you don’t play loudly, at that point the music will frazzle out. So limited, not surprising. Podcast quality is definitely an improvement from my phone’s speaker and in line with the price point, in general. I think it should be about $25 less. The app is useless. I guess I expected something from the app. I’m at a loss for the point of it. I tried it out on my phone. It continued so say my phone Bluetooth was not on. Even as I was literally playing music through it. I did all the stuff. Restart, reconnect etc. Reviewed the booklet, Nothing. Everything re the speaker and phone working fine. But what is the point of the app? I interpreted from the manual that I should download the app to get extra features. Maybe bass and treble controls? The book claims you can stack more speakers through the app but I would not invest in that as it continually says my phones Bluetooth is off. lolFine retro look, sturdy, small footprint and working out for podcasts. Do not think the app is or will be helpful.If I were to try another I’d probably go with the Klipsch of similar design. It’s approximately $50 more but better sound and working app.Remove $25 dollars off price on the Em II and it’s a fair deal.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024",True,11,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,Marshall

Very pleasant to the touch - on the outside it is covered with a kind of soft and pleasant rubber that hugs the skin. I think the cream version is the best. Very smooth and clean sound. It has 2 speakers on each side - one for low sounds and one for high sounds. The classic look gives it priority.

R1EA1XXVYAUBNB,"5.0 out of 5 stars A simple, solid speaker",L,5,"If you want great sound in a simple package, this bluetooth speaker will do the trick. Initially I found the control button kind of fiddly, but now that I have the hang of it I can manage it easily.Mostly I use this at home when watching movies or listening to the news with some music thrown in. A serious audiophile would probably want a speaker that allows for more control, but the sound profile suits my needs.I've had very little trouble with the speaker losing its connection. There are only a couple of spots in my apartment (~600 sq ft) where the connection breaks up; fortunately, the connection is solid everywhere else, particularly in those rooms where I mostly want to use it.Build quality feels good and solid, like it's going to hold up for a long time. The speaker did get a light spray of water on it one day when I'd left it on my balcony and it suddenly began to rain, but the speaker was just fine.Of course Marshall has a reputation for quality sound gear, but the price still feels a little high given how simple this is. However, if you can get it on sale (as I did) and bring the price down under $100, I think it's worth it.","Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2024",True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Emberton,Marshall

R1PKWJ1ZABTB2S,"5.0 out of 5 stars Love, love, love, and love...",Su Doki,5,"So good, I bought two instead of one Marshall Middleton. As wanted, I pair them together to get surround sound, smaller size, and save about $50. Although I own two pairs of Marshall headphones which I'm taking with me to Heaven, at that time - it took awhile for me to commit to buying the speakers. That's because I already own a pair of off-brand Bluetooth speakers that sound so much better and lasts many hours longer than more expensive Beats, Bose, Sony, etc. They have all the other bells-and-whistles specifications, including USB-C, rapid charging, 20+ hours playtime and only cost $30 each. The seller stopped selling them on Amazon.Emberton II was a huge jump in price. The difference from Emberton I - is it will pair with other Marshall speakers. But only the latest models like the Middleton or more Emberton IIs. Also, the Emberton II has a grain texture finish. The hardest part about buying Marshall products is knowing if you actually got authentic products. Knock-offs provide knock-off quality and it hurts the reputation of genuine products with bad reviews. I won't describe the differences in great details. The box is printed on all sides that spills over to other sides. It looks and feels real money, very expensively printed. Inside packaging and booklets too. The speaker is very well crafted down to the smallest details and feels solid. The grills are finished very well, individually, without any rough edges or mistakes and so is the Marshall signature emblem. Look closely.The Emberton II sound quality is phenomenal for all music genres. It's a work of art pumping out sound, spatially separating all the tracks of instruments and voices, to hear them together in one song. This is studio quality at a reasonable price. It exceeds my $30 pair, which already beat-out all the other more expensive speakers, in the only way it could. I heard sounds playing in music I've heard so many times, I can replay it verbatim in my head. Some folks might scoff at this price point comparison. But if I'm completely satisfied at $30 or $170 - no one can entice me to spend $1500 or $15,000 I can afford to pay too. I might purchase more Emberton II's to install wireless speakers throughout the house. For now, I'm pretty satisfied.","Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2023",True,22,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,Marshall

Even though my daughter kept telling me to get a JBL.I love the look of this little Marshall, classic! But, I probably should have listened to my daughter.The sound is decent to good. There is no ability to toggle any sort of EQ. So the sound you hear, is the sound you get. The thing that I like least about this speaker is the function button. There is only one that you depress in N,S,E, and W for different abilities, but it is loose. It wobbles around like a loose tooth. I would prefer a nice tight button that snaps in each direction. This has caused me to slip and call the wrong function and it just feels wrong.","Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2024",True,2,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II,Marshall

Traveling 90% of the time, I was tired of jamming things in my ears or feeling like I had a sauna on my head with over-ear headphones.I've tested the heavy hitters – B&O, Sonos, Bose, Megaboom (more like Mega Joke), Anker – and had almost thrown in the towel. Then a friend introduced me to the Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker, claiming it's as good or better than his fancy B&O speaker, but less than half the price.Now, when I saw the Marshall speaker's price tag at $128.00, I hesitated. I mean, I've been forking out $250.00 and more for other speakers. But curiosity got the better of me, and boy, am I glad it did! The Marshall speaker not only shattered my expectations with its deep bass and distortion-free music, even at volumes that could make my ears bleed.

You will not be returning this once you listen to the difference from other speakers. Caring case is really nice also and you can download a APP to your phone to adjust bass and all that stuff. I did not do anything different from the factory settings because it was so amazing right out of the box.","Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2023",True,8,Color: Black,JBL

R2SSSH04J4J264,5.0 out of 5 stars Really nice portable speaker for the price. Solid buy!,Bruce C,5,"Needed a new portable speaker for the home setup and once I saw that Beats (read: Apple) came out with the new Beats Pill, I bit the bullet and purchased one.First things first, the unboxing experience and the design of the speaker is quintessentially Apple. Speaker has a nice heft to it and the design of the speaker is really nice, with the angled design, and the speakers facing you.If you are in the Apple Ecosystem, this speaker was made for you as it connects to your iPhone the minute you turn it on with a very satisfying screen animation. I'm told you can easily connect with an Android product too but I didn't have one in hand to test out how easy it was.The sound quality of this speaker is really great for its size, living up to the Beats name, filling the room with punchy bass and crystal clear sound. Rated IP67 meaning it is dust and water resistant, so you can feel confident taking it to your next beach party or when you are traveling. Battery life of this thing is stated at a whopping 24 hrs. I'll definitely be testing that claim, but if true, is completely mind blowing.But what sets this speaker apart, and one of the main reasons why I bought it, is that it also doubles as a speakerphone!!! I can connect this badboy to my laptop, and take crystal clear Teams calls with it all day at work. And when I'm done with my calls, since it is connected to my laptop via USB-C, I can listen to lossless music on Apple Music. Mind...blown!Run, don't walk, to buy this awesome speaker!!","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",True,18,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,Beats

The design looks good and fits well with any room or setup.The only downside is that there isn't an app to control the speaker.

Compared to all of them this is an amazing speaker for the price point. Bass is great. Clarity is great. Build quality is great. You can even hook it up via usb c to get lossless music. I didnt notice much a difference that way. Also if your in the apple eco system it works like AirPods where you can switch between devices and also locate the speaker via find my.

Absolutely.Does it compete with Charge 4 or 5? Definitely not.Heres whySound: i purchased the Black Pill, right out of the box it is versatile in the sense it matches anything you have. I could’ve went with Champagne as well and would’ve also fit. I compared to flip 6 right away, it is Brighter, crisper and deeper bass at 50% volume and lower.However at above 50% the bass becomes muddy, it has this weird flutter sound to it. The Flip 6 Still Sounds great at 50% and lower just it sounds a little quieter and less vibrant compared to the Pill.The Charge 4 and 5 are bigger speakers and has bigger woofers.The pill is definitely very portable, great performance and most definitely great value for the money.Maybe later down the road i will purchase another for stereo sound bars for our TV.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",True,5,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,Beats

RTDXQGCW5S0SA,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect,Scooley,4,"I bought the new pill mainly to use wired for my gaming handhelds ROG Ally X and Steam Deck. Most Bluetooth speakers today are lacking AUX ports and any type of direct connection. Bluetooth audio is delayed which is annoying when playing a game or watching a video.CON: Only 4 stars instead of 5 because to use this wired you need to hold down the power button when you plug in the USB-C cable, so essentially, I have to do this every day. It's annoying and almost was almost a deal breaker. I've just gotten used to unplugging it when I take my handheld off the dock, it's nice that it powers off immediately when unplugged, so there's that, I guess.PRO: The new Beats Pill sounds good, it's better than a lot of other Bluetooth speakers I've had. Being in the Apple ecosystem it's nice that it's interconnected with my devices. One not so well-known feature is that you can change the volume of the tones the speaker makes when it turns on or off. Use an IOS device, go into settings in Bluetooth and Accessibility. Having a low volume tone is soo much better!","Reviewed in the United States August 13, 2024",True,3,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,Beats

The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats... However, with this being said, the performance is only half of what I hoped... the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note, which is sad because pill doesn't have an eq in its app at all.... the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines, mids are clear and neutral, highs are clear and crisp without any harshness, and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume, but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it's mostly just mids and highs.... They seriously could've added a passive radiator to the back of this thing and then would have something here....

R3A0CT3JVYDFX3,4.0 out of 5 stars Bass Heavy,Geomancer,4,"As you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer, you won't be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy. That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",False,12,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,Beats

Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet.

R1IDSWYH8GDHSG,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ android,Alan,5,"This is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn’t say it’s the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I’m interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it’s sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It’s minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a “better” speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don’t complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it’s the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you’ll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don’t even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it’s kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,Beats

RCS6YZDDME20Y,5.0 out of 5 stars The Pill punches far above it's weight class!!,Brian Severn,5,"Beats Pill (2024) is a high quality product, from the Apple'esque packaging, to the incredible sound output from this small [tiny?] Bluetooth speaker. Incredibly easy to use, connect via Bluetooth and your off to the races.This speaker is about the diameter of a Coke can, albeit longer. It has a pre-attached teather that seems strong enough. Claims to be IP67 water resistant. It comes with a small instruction manual and a USB-C charging cable (USB-C YAY!!!). They claim the battery life is 24 hrs, and it may well be as we've been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it's still going strong.I tested it via Bluetooth, mainly streaming via Apple Music, and or it's size it packs quite a punch! Decent mids and highs, and it has bass! Not tons of bass [expected for it's size, it's just physics), but it's decent, if not exceptional given the size of this, but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product, and this one doesn't disappoint! Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music. It's easy to control, there are four buttons: power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up.I really like It also has a built-in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well, and it works pretty good.In summary, for the price, compared to other ""party"" speakers around the same price class, the Pill punches far above it's weight class, feature sound clarity with decent bass, lots of volume, and simplicity in design as we've come to expect from Beats. While maybe not the cheapest ""party"" speaker out there, it is among one of the best, if not the best, in it's price class.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",False,1,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,Beats

I like that it is part of the apple family and I can easily move from one device to another quickly and seamlessly.The only minor thing i dont like is that the buttons are a little confusing. there are only 4 of them but you access certain features by long pressing or pressing combinations of buttons which is just unnecessarily complicated. I understand the reason why- its inline with the clean minimalist aesthetic that Steve Jobs expected of all apple products .

R2W2XN52WGT97C,5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!,Brett,5,"Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you. If that's the case, give it a try today!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,Beats

There is no dedicated power button, and in fact there are no instructions anyplace in the Apple/Beats ecosystem that tell you how to turn it off. (Push the Action button for more than 1, but less than 1.8 seconds.... how dumb is that?) With only 4 buttons, there are too many button sequence combos to remember. Seriously, a volume up/down AND a track up/down would have made life so much easier.All in all, this is a nice sounding Bluetooth speaker, with some good features, let down with a dumb user interface.

Can easily get battery information directly from device. AirPlay integration would have been welcome.Controls are simple, although take some practice to get used to. Power button controls both power and pairing. I do wish the Pill could be turned on with one touch of power button. I've yet to test the microphone/speaker function, but that's a nice enough addition.I find the sound great, but I am no audiophile. I intend to use this speaker for what portable speakers are best designed for- travel, beach, patio, etc. It sounds excellent, even at moderate volume. The dual pairing function looks awesome, although not within my use case.Design is sleek and feels solid- but light enough for great portability. The soft touch silicone feels great, although I can foresee being a bit of a dirt magnet, at least on the champagne gold model. The lanyard is a welcome addition, but I do wish it was adjustable- unsure what the point of adding a lanyard is if it cannot be tightened/loosened. USB-C is a great addition, as is fast fuel.Battery life is rated at 24H. Based on early usage, I would believe this to be reasonably accurate. Unit drained about 10% listening to podcasts at ~50% volume.Overall positive first impression. Definitely not a cheap speaker, but you are buying this for the ecosystem integration, good sound, and excellent battery life. Price is pretty on par with similar quality speakers.

RGSIQ5EFETRO2,Amazing sound quality in a hefty package (w/ usability issues),Ryan,4,"The Goods:🔊 As a Master's student looking for the perfect wireless speaker(s) for my monitor setup, I was thrilled by how good the new Beats Pill sounds. With a punchy bass and a wide sound stage even for classical/film music, I've enjoyed using them (yes, I got a pair) for music and watching Netflix. The sound quality from stereo pair is absolutely amazing.🔋 I love that it is type C fast-charge, and that battery lasts for at least 2-days of normal use; the feature to reverse charge ur other devices is certainly nice but a bit gimmicky in my opinion considering I've never found a scenario to do so.📲 It supports airplay and findmy, and I could control it from my Mac, Macbook, iPhone, iPad, and my Apple Watch. A nice convenience feature.The Bad:❌ A price tag of $199 CAD (2x HomePod mini) is just not affordable to most, especially for a pair ($398)❌ The shape of the pill + the rather hefty weight makes it harder to grab❌ Sometimes I'd get the spinny wheel on Airplay for the longest time without connecting to the Pill❌ I could not connect to the app for stereo pair at all. The app never ""found"" my Pills.❌ You must hold down your fingers on two Pills concurrently to enter stereo mode, not v user friendly.❌ With power button serving many functions, I had to learn how many seconds it takes to turn on/off, enter pairing mode, etc.❌ The soft rubber surface on top and around the Pill's back attract all kinds of micro dusts and lint.Verdict: While the New Beats Pill delivers incredible sound quality, compatibility, and performance, it is NOT designed with user-friendly interactions in mind. The many little inconveniences will eventually add up to the point you realize it is probably not worth it for its hefty price tag.Alternative: The Bose SoundFlex offers virtually the same features (except for Airplay compatibility), it is more affordable, has a functional in-app pairing/control experience, has an extra speaker grill in its back, and pairs to 2 devices simultaneously while supporting automatic pause/play as you switch between devices.","Reviewed in Canada July 31, 2024",True,2,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,Beats

RWJ5WXT4YDCW3,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Portable Speaker EVER - Here's Why!,Tyler Clark,5,"I have used and abused my Mega Boom 3s for over four years and other models even longer with nothing but success. People compare them to bose and other brands but they are incomparable and here's why. I have put these speakers through 125f summers sitting in the cab of a car pushing 140f inside. They do have a heat sensor that tells them to not turn on. So I dunked them in my ice water filled cooler for a few minutes and bam good to go. I pressure wash my sand covered golf cart with the speakers playing in the cup holders, pressure wash the speakers too, played the entire time and clean as new. I have dropped them off tailgates, coolers, ladders, still pushing. I have thrown one in a pool, still good. I mostly use them in Baghdad where I work and they push straight through the summer with impressive battery life in the heat. They sound exactly as good as the similar model bose, I compared and played two and two around a pool, but half the price and one hundred times the durability. I pair mine year-round, and now one auto-connects as the master and the other always connects as the slave every time I turn it on, so I never even have to open the app. This feature is amazing. Everyone always asks me about these speakers because they sound so good when paired offering a pool, patio, golf cart, or bedroom stereo quality sound. Truly there is no next step beyond these speakers with portability as they are the best sounding and still capable to be utilized outdoors safely. The only speakers that sound better all lose the imortality this speaker offers. I have never owned any other electronic I could literally pressure wash the dirt off, its insane. I have other models I take kayaking and abuse to mud, sand, and a LOT of water, still work like new. Biggest tip, attach a very large carabiner to the fabric loop. I hang mine from everything, everywhere, at all times. And dont get one, get two at a minimum. That is where the joy really comes in. My one complaint, the system needs a hair of time to process sound, so if you watch them with a movie they are slightly behind the video.","Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2023",True,48,Color: Night BlackStyle: MEGABOOM 3,Ultimate Ears

Overall, sound quality, size, build quality and features is just perfect. The speaker packs an immersive sound and the size is perfect (big enough to put out rich sound but not too big, perfectly portable). Innumerable times I've let it fall, yet it only has minor cosmetic damage. Very easy controls and the app has is very simple design, with PartyUp which works amazing too (I have a Hyperboom and these two sound incredible together). The reason why I only gave it four stars is because at high levels, depending on the song obviously, this speaker tends to compress the sound so that it doesn't distorts, which makes it have volume fluctuation on the highs (when the kick hits, for example), so this sacrifices sound balance for undistorted sound. It happens only at max volume and is really not that noticeable so it doesn't affect sound quality. This is not something to worry about for general consumers though, only audiophiles like me. Battery also lasts, specially at a normal volume level. I've gone for days without charging it, using it consistently. Bluetooth connectivity easily gets interrupted with walls and other objects but range is not that bad.

Just found the option in the Android app was restored, which allows turning-off the battery-draining remote-on feature!! The feature (switch) in the app is marked ""new"", so this looks like a recent development. Happy to give 5 stars now.Speaker has been rock solid for over a year, and sounds great. Had another (newer) speaker die some months back (wouldn't turn on), so happy this one is going strong.Wouldn't have been so fussy, but with these portable speakers, the battery is ""do or die"". Being fair, the battery drain wasn't ""that bad"", but was still a problem.------- Updated 6/14/2023 -------Very unhappy with Megaboom 3 now; down-rating to 2 stars (not 1) since the sound is good, but downgrading from 5 due to ""battery drain"". Apparently there is some sort of ""always on bluetooth remote"" feature that drains the battery, even when not in use. Since I only use this speaker when I want portability, this is a MAJOR SHOWSTOPPER for me.In researching, I find posts saying that the app could formerly disable this feature, but that the feature can no longer be disabled (as-of several years ago).In the future, I'll stick with JBL or Oontz. NOT happy.------- Original Review --------Very happy with my Megaboom 3. I ""drive"" it from a Samsung Android phone, with the ""rock"" EQ selected in Android settings. No EQ from Megaboom app: just flat. While I know these speakers (all brands) struggle with bass, as a bass-player that grew-up with 200W and 2x15"" speakers, I can't complain when tiny speakers struggle with the low frequencies. It's basic physics.I have nice headphones and a bigger bluetooth speaker, I never lug around, but for the small speaker I wanted for portability, it is very nice. My use-case is indoor, mid-volume. 12W probably won't ""shatter windows"" outside, but I don't need that. I certainly prefer the sound the Megaboom 3 to my Beats Studio Buds.Bonus: You can replace the battery!

It's cool that you can get it soaking wet without fear. But if you plan on using it mostly at home, and can live with your shower tunes coming from a speaker that's on the bathroom sink and not in the tub with you, I think the money is better spent elsewhere.I am willing to compromise on sound quality for a durable speaker I can take basically anywhere, but this... It's pretty rough. The bass is unrestrained and totally dominates the rest of the music. The treble just can't keep up. Even using the in-app EQ (which is surprisingly nice) is not enough. Vocal transients vanish, the crack of the snare drum turns into a thud, and distorted guitars become a total cacophony when played through this speaker. Maybe I'm being a little hyperbolic, but it's bad enough that it's annoying and totally takes the fun out of listening for me.If you're an unpicky listener, it probably won't sound horrible to your ear. If you don't really listen with intent and use music as background noise, this speaker is perfectly functional. But if you have a critical ear, you will definitely be able to hear the sound quality issues of this device right off the bat without doing any A/B comparison. And sitting down and doing A/B between this and any other thing you own will make you return this product like I'll be doing.Oh yeah, I almost forgot. It uses a micro USB cable, and that's not even the most frustrating thing about the cable. The plastic over molding on the micro end of the cable has square corners. The place on the speaker where the cable goes is recessed, and has round corners. The included cable does fit, but only just barely, and it's fiddly to get it connected.","Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2024",True,1,Color: Sunset RedStyle: MEGABOOM 3,Ultimate Ears

R151UE9T6PC6PH,"4.0 out of 5 stars Solid mid range Bluetooth Speaker, but a few significant drawbacks.",Jack,4,"In my quest to find a bluetooth speaker that I wouldn't freak about if I dropped it in the river, I stumbled upon Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM 3. This thing floats! I love it. No fear at all taking this thing boating.I got it for $130 and at that price is a good value. It lacks the bass and volume of a higher quality mid range speaker such as Sonos Move or Bose Portable, but at moderate volume, it's fidelity rivals that of those speakers at a third of their price.The ethics of buying stuff made in this product's country of origin is getting dicier by the day...that's my biggest hangup with this speaker. It could be made elsewhere and keep my conscience clear, but, business degrees only care about money in pocket right now. That said, if you are paying more than $130...I think the juice vs squeeze equation is less favorable.This product's reliance on the app is also questionable (have since discovered I can use it as a bluetooth speaker without the app--score!). What else is being compromised because I have to use an app to use a bluetooth speaker? This is probably one of those things that I will regret five years down the road. Frustrating in that regard. You shouldn't need a burner phone to enjoy music.The lack of microphone is somewhat of a drawback too.

R2UZPAXLA8L9JK,3.0 out of 5 stars I really wanted to like it,design guy,3,"I have been on the hunt for finding the perfect bluetooth speaker for my needs.UE makes great stuff. I first tried their hyperboom which was an awesome speaker that sounded great. It's just pretty big and cumbersome. Great for if you don't wanna move it around a lot.I downsized to this one. The size is perfect and has been great in many different scenarios. You can really toss it around and not be concerned with damaging it at all. The fit and finish is top notch along with the form factor.Right out of the box though I wasn't very impressed with the sound quality. They advertise ""thundering bass"" or whatever, but I was underwhelmed even with the most bass heavy songs with the speaker placed in a corner to help reverberate the sound.I figured it might just need some breaking in before it starts to sound better, but after a couple weeks of using it every day it had no change in sound quality.Overall it really doesn't sound horrible, but I'm picky with my audio and speakers and headphones, etc. It's probably fine for the vast majority of people out there.After almost a month of using it, it started to develop some pretty bad distortion on the bass when played at even medium volumes. Some songs were exceptionally bad with the low end distortion.I had not used the speaker in any water or had it ever been submerged so I can rule that out as to a possible cause to it.I also feel that after a month of using it, the battery life doesn't seem to be what it first was out of the box. Maybe this is because I'm using it louder environments where it needs to be played slightly louder, but this is just my observation.I really wanted to like this speaker, but I've moved on to now try the anker soundcore motion boom with higher hopes.Edit: been a couple weeks with the soundcore motion boom and I can say this speaker is miles better than the megaboom.

R3NV0CNBS5BVV8,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good Sound, Bad UI",Mr. Litwin,3,"I used to be a big Ultimate Ears guy from the aughts before they were bought by Logitech who killed their best product lines and replaced it with stuff like... THIS. The tiresome photos of impossibly gleeful adult-babies listening to music underwater and having the times of their lives thanks to this f——g speaker really gets cloying when it’s printed on literally everything except the device itself. But that’s Logitech for you. Of all things I have to complain about with this speaker, the sound isn’t one of them. Unlike its predecessors and smaller cousins, the Megaboom 3 doesn’t peak out the bass quite so much when it would otherwise be distorted. (This is the most common bit of digital audio gimmickry to fool you into think it sounds “crystal clear”.) The people complaining about this speaker in these reviews who say other brands are better are just brands more notorious for “loudness fakery” to make the sound seem more bass-heavy but is really just slick audio post-processing. It’s makes hip hop sound a little better but everything else is a murky mess. But I digress. This speaker does all of the digital trickery, sure, but at least the actual amplifier and speaker drivers aren’t rubbish so that’s I plus. I was playing System of a Down cranked in my bedroom and it sounded amazing, especially compared to my former Boom speaker which someone nicked from my garage. Where the Boo crumpled trying to product screeching highs and thumping lows the Megaboom 3 dominated. Of course I don’t use any of the EQ tomfoolery and let it play as close to how the music was engineered to play and its just dandy. Okay then, good sound: check.The problem with this speaker, like all of the other UE speakers, is the brain-dead user interface and obnoxious audio feedback that you can’t properly adjust without hacking the device configs (allegedly). There is literally a single on/off switch for all audio feedback. Wut? No relative volume of system sounds compared to music, or selection of which sounds you want to hear and which ones you don’t, like that HORRIBLY OBNOXIOUS LOUD BEEP it makes that’s louder than the music if you accidentally lean in on your volume up button? Of course every sound is as loud as or louder than the music your playing. That’s just great. Furthermore, if you are listening to music through your iPad or iPhone, it decides to insert little beeps for certain feedback notifications that never happen when you are just using your device without the speaker. It’s horribly distracting and unnecessary, but worse is that you NEED audio feedback on if you want to be able to Bluetooth connect to it as audio feedback is the only feedback you get.Ugh. Sorry, had a bit of a rant there.It’s tough because I think the speak sounds decent and almost worth the price, but the UI team at Logite... excuse me... Ultimate Ears are clearly huffing paint fumes as each product they subsequently release is even more unpleasant to use than the last.

Just pair it to a phone or computer, and it works after you've pressed the Bluetooth button on the speaker. But … if you're impressed enough to get a second speaker to hear all in stereo, you'll need some advice, which you'll not get from Ultimate Ears.Do not first connect one or both speakers to your phone and then later connect them to your computer to test things out because the speakers have a tiny little brain and seem to remember what they've been connected to in the past and get confused when Bluetooth pairings have been left on.To connect the speakers to your phone, remove all other Bluetooth connections to the speakers. Play music on your phone. Switch one speaker ON (it becomes the master speaker … consider marking it somehow), and ensure the other is OFF. Pair this speaker to your phone by pressing the Bluetooth button on the master speaker. It should fire up. Now switch ON the second (slave) speaker. To connect the slave speaker to the master, press the '+' and Bluetooth buttons simultaneously on the 'master' for 5 secs or so until the master says 'tum-tum-tum' and its Bluetooth light flashes, which says I am ready to pair. Now press the Bluetooth button twice fairly quickly on the slave speaker… like click.click not click ….. click (if it pairs with the master, its Bluetooth light should flash … if not … double press the slave speaker's Bluetooth button again). When its Bluetooth button flashes, leave the slave speaker alone. It will connect in 10 secs or so.If you switch a paired computer on while playing from your phone, the music will stop because the computer screws up the Bluetooth connection between the phone and the speaker, and the speaker becomes confused.If confused switch both speakers off, disconnect Bluetooth pairings that are not needed, and repeat the process.","Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2023",True,18,Color: Night BlackStyle: MEGABOOM 3,Ultimate Ears
R22E5M0I3DEGI0,"2.0 out of 5 stars A glimmer of potential, but incredibly overrated and laughably overpriced for a barely usable sound",Skylar,2,"As a starter audiophile I tend to take my music very seriously. Especially as a metal fan, the music of which tends to involve a lot of complex and various elements going on all at once within a given sound, I have learned to really have a keen ear as to what I want to hear in a speaker. Getting into highly dynamic music, my search for a Bluetooth speaker that at least comes close to the quality of my Audio Technica ATH M50xs is a recent one and, unfortunately, one that has not given me any success so far. The JBL Charge 4, my last experience with a speaker (as well as a Charge 3 before that), was pretty good and could handle a lot of volume, but I always felt that the sound distorted a little bit when pushed up high (something which can be easily avoided), and in my search, this particular speaker was often regarded to be a ""high-end"", ""premium"", ""great sounding"" speaker, and in one case someone directly referenced it as superior to the Charge 3 and 4. Intrigued, I decided to invest in one.Unfortunately, my experience has been less than ""high-end"". Getting past a certain volume level meant for outdoor use (I work an outside warehouse with a lot of machinery running), the sound distorts heavily, especially in the lower frequencies, which is where I'm going to guess the speaker gets the name ""Megaboom"", because it does boom like a MF, but not in a GOOD way, because on certain bass-heavy production jobs on some albums the bass vibrates in a very unpleasant way that reminds one somewhat of a blown speaker. Which, in fact, I previously bought one off of eBay and it was incredibly BLOWN when I got it. I returned it, and finding someone with the same model, it sounded a lot better on theirs. So I figured, y'know, I just got a bad unit, Ill order a brand new one. But this one was barely even marginally better. Even toning down to some electronic music and lighter rock, which I am also into, the sound still was barely salvageable, to the point where I almost wasnt enjoying listening to it. And mind you, all this was also including tweaking the EQ settings, updating the software for the speaker (which you must do with their app after getting it as it prompts you to, I use an Android), and FACTORY RESETTING IT to try to fix a charging problem. It's only when I have the speaker at HALF OR LOWER volume that it starts to sound ""better"".Which brings me to the other major issue. The battery life. I dont know what the deal with this thing is, but on the first day after blasting it I needed to charge it after 4 hours. Which, ok, I didnt really care cause I know they test the battery life on these things with certain types of music at certain volume levels, but regardless, that ""20 hours battery life"" claim? BFS, don't believe it, unless you're only going to be using it at slightly below half volume, indoors, and even then its tricky. After that, I was literally using the speaker for 20 MINUTES and being told ""critical battery, please charge"". This was when I found out about the supposed ""factory reset"" solution, but it doesn't seem to have worked for me so far.As far as durability, its fine. It withstands dust and slight water contact fine. Which is honestly the only real strength I can give this thing at this point.Its in times like this that I curse the day I ever got into high-end audio, because when something is marketed as ""super premium"" and seems to get passed around like the word of God, I now have to be wary of what I buy and what sales-talk I hear, because what they market these types of speakers on these days is horrendous. This speaker could do with a heavy overhaul, ESPECIALLY with the price they're asking. Im just glad I only got the $175 red model, and not the other $200 colors (why so expensive???). Currently getting customer support for the battery problem, but honestly Im going to be returning this and looking for something else. This gets a no from me. Get the JBL Charge 4 if you want something similar in price with a (somewhat) better value for the money. The Charge 4 is roughly $150, btw.Thank God/Satan/Buddha for return policies.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2019",True,6,Color: Sunset RedStyle: MEGABOOM 3,Ultimate Ears

The crisp, powerful sound will leave you instantly addicted. And with an incredible battery life, it will not shut off on its own either so be prepared to lose your job and maybe even your family because you can't stop listening. Luckily, it is very portable (fits snuggly in a backpack bottle holder and has a loop to clip onto) so I find it convenient to take around the house, gym, and for recreational activities.I work out in a large gym; but with the mighty sound of this musical beauty, I can leave the speaker in the middle of the weightroom without worrying about it being too quiet. Using the Megaboom 3 made me the king of the gym and gave me my own ""Iron Throne"". For you bass fiends like myself, have no doubts the Megaboom 3 is everything its name indicates it is. The reverbating bass can pulse through your body like an adrenaline rush. Even at high volume, I have heard no bass distortion. What amazes me is that a speaker with amazing bass can also it all the high notes/tones just as well.The speaker pairs extremely quickly and the Megaboom mobile app can be really useful for turning the speaker on/off remotely and controlling EQ. The speaker's physical beauty from it's slick sheen puts all the IG models that you probably follow to shame.I have so far enjoyed EDM, hip-hop, pop, country, rock, and epic dramatic music with it, and all genres benefit from the amazing sound quality of the Megaboom 3. This beautiful speaker is worth the price and more. But if you are someone who has low self-esteem, go ahead, settle for a lower-priced speaker..you probably don't care about yourself or your listening experience anyways. Know that every time you turn your peasant speaker on, you'll wish you had the incredible Megaboom 3.Update: I have used this speaker for 2 years now and it still works amazingly with wonderful sound and great battery life.

RNMP2E7TZXJNE,4.0 out of 5 stars Bluetooth stopped working after 1.5yrs,Angelika R,4,"We LOVE UE Megaboom speakers. Our purchase of this Megaboom 3 in May-2021 was a replacement of an older model Megaboom I had used for a few years as a fitness instructor. So we are more or less faithful to this brand and think the quality is super. However our recent speaker lasted short of 2yrs before the Bluetooth function just stopped working - it will not connect to anything anymore rendering it close to useless.We purchased a different $67 popular off brand speaker on Amazon with good reviews. Listened to music on it once and sent it straight back, it sounded like utter horse poo. UE Megaboom has the quality sound and is worth the money. We are going to purchase our 3rd Megaboom today but are hoping the Bluetooth issue does not repeat.

R28VGQRLRZPHRO,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent portable option,Jerry,5,"I have owned several Bluetooth speakers over the years and this one wins for most well rounded. I came to the Megaboom as my primary BT speaker from a JBL Charge 4 (which my son now uses). While the JBL is more bass heavy, the megaboom provides a more well rounded sound accenting the middle and high frequencies while still providing ample bass. The megaboom also seems to be louder (although I didn’t run a side by side test on volume). As with all smaller speakers the megaboom really shines when placed against a wall or in an alcove to help the bass. My only complaint (and it’s minor) is that the upright cylinder style makes it kinda hard to place it on various outdoor surfaces. Oh - the app makes adjusting the sound very easy although I find the flat adjustment to be most realistic. Also, you definitely want to look into a charging base if you are going to be moving it around as the single line input gets cumbersome.Overall, recommended.","Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2023",True,5,Color: Lagoon BlueStyle: MEGABOOM 3,Ultimate Ears

I have an Oontz that provides huge bang for the buck. The Megaboom 3 is clearly better, but 5-7x better? Probably not.I also bought a Bose Soundlink Flex and decided to return the Megaboom 3 and keep the Soundlink. I'm not a Bose fan at all, but side by side, the Bose had a warmer sound with more separation especially in the mids (surprising since I usually find Bose pretty harsh). Bass was equivalent--which is to say not very good unless you take into account the size of these things, then quite remarkable.It could be this gets louder than the Soundlink--I don't really know since I listen at moderate levels and both were plenty loud for me.Bottom line on smallish portable speakers: bigger is almost always better wrt sound. You absolutely will not get meaningful bass out of anything this size. But sometimes portability is more important. Given that standard, the Soundlink beats the Megaboom 3, but not by a huge amount.","Reviewed in the United States March 10, 2022",True,3,Color: Night BlackStyle: MEGABOOM 3,Ultimate Ears

It's not the smallest portable bluetooth out there, but it's size was still convenient enough to take along on two ski trips with me this winter. I've purchased & returned 7 different portable bluetooth outdoor speakers over the last year, & found this to be the best of the bunch..(Tried the UE Wonderboom, several Altec-Lansing models, Bose & a others that I've already forgotten the names).It's not the cheapest model out there, but I think I got my money's worth for the $200 I paid. The bluetooth range on this is far better than the speakers priced up to $100 or so. Like most bluetooth devices, you'll get some dead spots when moving it around inside & outside the house. but it's easy to work around that.The only feature I don't like is it always tells me to download the app & have internet connectivity to use all it's features. I haven't bothered to download the app, & besides that, who always has internet connectivity? Other than the annoying voice telling me to do that, & the inability to turn it off without the app, I've had no problems with it. To turn it off, I simply stop my bluetooth signal & the speaker turns off less than 5 mintues later.As to battery life, I've had it going for 6 or 7 hours at a moderate volume. Cant' say that I've had it at maximum volume for more than a couple of hours, however.All & all, this is a really GREAT speaker. It's not perfect, but what is?

R3LZZ2BNQNY41C,3.0 out of 5 stars Not as good as the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ Portable,JB,3,"So I needed an outdoor speaker for the backyard and didn't want to spend a lot of money on a dedicated system. I have the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ Portable for inside use, and it did an awesome job when I was testing it in my backyard. Problem is I have kids who will drop it, beat it up, leave it out in the rain, and so on, so I didn't want to expose the Bose to all of that danger. After reading lots of reviews, I decided this UE Megaboom 3 would be my next best option. After using the Bose prior to this, this did not live up to my expectations. The Megaboom 3 has decent high and mid-frequency sound, but the bass is very very lacking. For being version 3 of something called ""megaboom"" I expected a whole heck of a lot more. And yes, I got this new in retail box from Amazon proper, not a refurb or knockoff from a shady reseller. The problem with not having a lot of bass is the music just doesn't sound as full or fleshed-out, so it's kind of weak and disappointing when listening to most music types, including pop, rock, classical, occasional hip hop, etc. For the cost of this speaker, I expected a lot better compared to other bluetooth speakers I've heard for substantially less money.If your goal is great quality outdoor music on a deck, patio, or back yard, I would steer you towards the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ Portable, with the knowledge that it is admittedly more expensive and less rugged. If you can keep it covered up or take it in with you when you're done, you'll be much happier spending the extra money on this one.If your goal is ruggedness with an acceptable loss of bass and deeper, richer music, then this would likely work for you.For what it's worth, I am actually keeping this unit since at the end of the day I need something tough that will take a beating, which I hope this will do (time will tell).","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2019",True,5,Color: Sunset RedStyle: MEGABOOM 3,Ultimate Ears

R3BSUBFTORQSQY,1.0 out of 5 stars Speaker unusable due to known bug UE refuses to fix,Keegan Clinton,1,"To start, I have a UE Wonderboom which I got back in 2017. That thing still runs today beautifully. The battery doesn't last as long as when I got it, but other than that no complaints whatsoever.It was because of my Wonderboom that I decided to get the Megaboom 3. Unfortunately, this speaker is rendered useless due to playback/firmware issues. Playback is stopped constantly at which point the speaker repeats the same message over and over ""to use this feature, make sure your app is running and connected to internet"". This issue began on the first day of using this speaker but at the start would happen once or twice a day. Since then it has consistently gotten worse and worse to the point where the speaker is now unusable.I have found no way of stopping this. Turning off all sharing features in the app, hard resetting the speaker & even running the speaker without ever installing the app all proved fruitless. The speaker will cut out every 10-15 seconds to repeat the same message and pause the music. You have to manually restart the music only for it to do the same thing by the time you've put the phone back down. The speaker is rendered useless by this constant bug. The ""Magic"" button will start flashing randomly as if it is trying to connect to something and then pause the music to deliver the news that the thing you're not trying to do can't be done.This is a known issue, there are numerous posts all over Reddit & other forums discussing this issue with no one seeming able to find a fix. It seems like this should be a pretty simple firmware update that we should be able to install, yet the first post I saw of this issue dates back to 2019. This has been an issue for people for 4 years & UE has still not sent a patch. Seems like they aren't too concerned by this.I would avoid & look elsewhere for a speaker.

I swiped back to Standard and the speaker came back to life. Hmm, all I did was bump the bass and treble so I reset the Custom and as soon as I made the sliders go up at all the thing threw a limiter at me and dropped the loudness instantly. It's a really aggressive limiter but if the goal is to make sure you never distort the speaker it will achieve that at the compromise of getting the sound you want at the same volume. So, if you think your speaker sounds quiet, you probably touched the EQ. Put it back to standard and listen how much louder it is.The audio person in me says HANDS OFF UE, but as a product designer – ugh, I get it. Majority will never notice, care or think anything negative of their experience using it. I'd say that last sentence is important to remember in your decision as this speaker is extremely well built, sounds great, floats and will not disappoint.Docking a star for the heavy handed DSP being used but if an update brings the ability to go into an advanced mode I'll change that.","Reviewed in the United States October 4, 2018",True,205,Color: Night BlackStyle: MEGABOOM 3,Ultimate Ears

I live on a horse farm and this thing has rolled off the 4wheeler and gotten ran over and not a scratch. I use it skiing to and I fell right on it, not a scratch. The only thing that I don't like about this speaker is the bluetooth. From only 10 ft away if my body gets between the speaker and my phone the music will break up. Now I never had a problem with that on any of there other speakers. My ue roll2, ue boom 2, ue megaboom all keep booming if my body gets in the way. Hopefully this is something ue will update soon.

R2R9DHSUEOTY3Y,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Bluetooth Speaker,TanMan,5,"I wanted a waterproof Bluetooth speaker for the pool area. So I bought a large one at a local big box store, and I was completely disappointed. It worked well enough, but it wasn't loud enough, even on maximum loudness. So I returned that and got the MegaBoom 3 instead.The MegaBoom 3 is MUCH smaller, yet it's MUCH louder. Even outside, I haven't yet set it to maximum volume, and I hear it fine 150 feet away. And the sound is fantastic. There's no front, so the sound is the same 360 degrees around the speaker. There's an Android app that can turn the speaker on and off and shows you the battery status. If you get more of these speakers, you can join then in the app in a ""party"" mode.There are two downsides to this speaker. First, there's no microphone, so I can't control my phone from it or use it to make calls. Second, it's awkward to carry, since it has no handle, just a fabric loop at the top. I did get a carabiner handle that just fit through the loop, so now I carry it using that handle (see the attached pictures).","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2019",True,35,Color: Night BlackStyle: MEGABOOM 3,Ultimate Ears

R29NJME9GM5IVB,5.0 out of 5 stars Another EXCELLENT Sonos product,J. Sanchez,5,"I am an owner of two Sonos home speakers: the One and the One SL. These are amazing sounding speakers that are easy to use. While I love these speakers, they are not portable as they must stay plugged into an outlet in order to work. I looked at the Sonos Move but was turned off by the size of the speaker and the high price. Needless to say, when Sonos introduced the Roam, I was intrigued. I got it as a father's day gift and what follows are my thoughts on the new Sonos Roam.SoundMy main concern with the Roam was that I noticed it was rather small and how that would effect the sound quality and loudness of the speaker. I was foolish for thinking this however. Sonos is known for having excellent sounding speakers and they would not jeopardize that reputation by putting out a new product that didn't adhere to their high audio standards. This speaker sounds amazing! Music sounds rich and full of depth. The clarity of the highs is excellent and the bass is surprisingly rich and full. Further to the point, the Sonos app allows you to tailor the sound to your liking, adding more of less treble and/or bass. I cannot overstate how pleased I am with the audio quality of this diminutive speaker.As a secondary point under sound, I was also concerned about how loud the speaker could get. Indoors, this little gem can get plenty loud and fill a large space with amazing sound. Outdoors, the Roam does a better than adequate job of projecting great music. I have taken it in my backyard while doing some yard work and it gets loud enough to hear and enjoy the music. However, I don't think Sonos designed this speaker to pump out the tunes at the pool party or at the beach like the EU Boom 3 or other larger bluetooth speakers. It can function adequately in that role but excels in smaller spaces and in overall sound quality.FunctionalityThe speaker works seamlessly with my other two Sonos speakers via WiFi using the Sonos app. The ability to move the speaker all over the house is a major plus. I can configure the Roam to play alone or with either one or both of my other speakers. I love that versatility. The buttons have some straight forward uses and also are multi-functional, which can take some getting used to. For example, I have issues sometimes with the power button and how long to push it. Five seconds to turn it off, a quick push to put it in sleep mode to save power. Same with the play/pause button: once to pause music, twice to advance to the next song, three times to go back to previous song, press and hold for a second to put the speaker in bluetooth pairing mode, and press and hold and listen for a sound in order to be able to swap your music from the Roam to the closest Sonos speaker or vice versa. It has taken some getting used to initially but I'm getting the hang of it.The battery life is good but I wish it were better. I get about 8 hours of play time per charge. Charging is another small issue. Sonos includes a USB-C (plugs into speaker) to USB-A (plugs into charger) charging cable with the speaker, but they do not include a charging adapter to plug into the wall. Luckily, I have an Apple iPad USB-C to USB-C cable with a large 20w charging adapter that charges the Roam very quickly. I highly recommend the larger charging adapter to greatly reduce charging time. As a side note, the speaker can function fully while being charged.Airplay and bluetooth connectivity are straightforward and work well. I have not had any issues connecting the speaker via bluetooth to my phone, laptop and various other devices around my home.FormThe speaker works in either a horizontal or vertical position with some claiming there is a difference in the sound. That is a matter of preference as I like both positions for different reasons. Horizontally, the speaker is designed to project the sound up and it seems to use the surface the speaker is sitting on to amplify the sound. Vertically it sounds great and it is much easier to access the control buttons on top. Ultimately, I love the design of the Roam because it is small, clean and elegant looking.In my opinion, the Sonos Roam is an excellent speaker because of its portability, convenience of use within my existing Sonos system, and its superb audio performance.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2021",True,193,Size: SingleColor: White,Sonos
RHGO648CL0OJY,5.0 out of 5 stars Love the speaker but found an airplay issue,Miguel Gracia,5,"I really like this speaker, it is unique in the market because it is small, portable, wireless (can connect to your wifi ) and Bluetooth capable. I love to use it at home as desktop airplay speaker. One thing I experienced one time is when the speaker reached ~40% battery the airplay connection started to failed, sound was cutting really bad and I was not able to play continuously. not even I turned off/on. Once I connected to the power the problem was fixed so I am not sure if that was a glitch or something real. A second thing I don't like is that currently you have to open the SONOS app to check the battery level while airplaying it , I wish you can do the same from the airplay menu maybe that is an apple problem. Difficult to write about sound quality, I can only tell how it sounds compare to a apple homepod mini (similar sound quality less loud) , Bose Micro soundlink (Sonos has much better sound quality and louder) Bose Mini soundlink (Sonos has better sound quality, less bass, less loud) JBL clip 4 (sonos has ultra much better quality ). Overall I think this is the best small/micro sound system in the market, don't buy JBL clip 4 or Bose micro soundlink those are trash compare to this one.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2022",True,24,Size: SingleColor: Black,Sonos
R23F5APEBV0H4E,1.0 out of 5 stars connect is a huge pain,dylan freiermuth,1,"honestly this speaker is pretty loud, sounds fairly good, a has a decent battery life too. the only problem is connecting to it is annoying. they made it so the power button and the bluetooth connectivity button are the same button. a small press turns the speaker off, a long press has it go into connectivity mode, buttt too long of a press hard shuts off the speaker. this problem is double downed by the fact that the button isnt ""tactical click"" its smooth and shallow so sometimes (not always) its hard to tell if you're actually pressing it downthe speaker will automatically search for the last connected device as soon as it turns on so you dont always have to play the button dance, but from time to time for no reason at all my phone/computer just refuse to reconnect and you have to unpair and repair, playing the button dance once more...they also decided to place this easy to press soft shallow button right next to the power connection so expect to bump it plugging the speaker inif they had just made them two separate buttons i would hands down say this is an amazing little speaker but having to spend 5 minutes a few times a day trying to connect to the darn thing is one of the most frustrating daily tasks i have and i wouldnt recommend getting this speaker","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2022",True,25,Size: SingleColor: Black,Sonos

RCP5UH68U3S6L,3.0 out of 5 stars Sonos' most disappointing product is almost acceptable,JOSHUA,3,"The Roam is a small speaker, for which you're going to have to expect lower audio quality. This thing definitely does not have the somewhat richer sound of a One. Being able to pop the plug and take it with me is great and the battery life is excellent but the Roam has some pretty significant flaws that would make me not recommend it.It has very fine-grained volume controls yet everything below about 25% is almost completely inaudible. With other Sonos products you can comfortably set the volume to 10% and have an enjoyable listening experience. With the Roam you're going to literally wonder if it's on at all until you turn it up to about 28. It doesn't matter what source you use -- a test signal at full signal won't even be audible in the lower 20% of the volume band.This leads to the second problem: if you set the volume to a point where you can actually hear music, the Alexa voice is EAR SHATTERINGLY LOUD. If you set the volume to the point where Alexa isn't trying to make you have a heart attack, your music is inaudible.The software's a bit buggy as well. It can't be paired with any of your other speakers but it can be grouped with them. If you group the Roam with another speaker that's playing you have about a 50/50 shot of it just not doing anything at all. It'll be connected, the controls will respond, it'll be visible in the app as grouped, you just won't get any audio. After a little fooling around with it, you can sometimes work around the problem by starting the playback on the Roam and grouping something else to it. Adding the Roam to a group doesn't work reliably at all.Some other software bugs make this thing a bit less fun. While it remembers if it was last used in Bluetooth or in Sonos mode and will return to the selected mode when turned on again, it's not very reliable to switch between modes. This isn't something you normally have to do often unless you take your Roam out of the house a lot; just leaving it in the Sonos network is viable wherever your WiFi reaches. Take it on a trip, though, and you're going to spend the first 4 or 5 minutes trying to get it to actually switch into Bluetooth mode.Re-pairing the Bluetooth is similarly annoying. It doesn't pair with more than a single device so it's extra steps for switching who's DJing. This isn't a problem while the Roam is at home and participating in your Sonos setup, of course.My real complaint, though, and something that was exceedingly poorly documented when the product was released is that it DOES NOT PAIR WITH ANYTHING except another Roam.Battery life, as I said, is great. This comes at something of a cost, though: this sucker is way heavier than it looks. Personally, I'd have preferred half the (excellent!) battery life if it meant more room in there for better actual speakers. The audio is, really, barely passable at best and outright embarrassing for something Sonos branded.It is not tunable with TruePlay. It claims to have some kind of automatic TruePlay learning mode but I have not in any way noticed an improvement in the disappointing sound quality with it running.The Roam is definitely better than a no-name Bluetooth speaker you'd buy at Target. That faint praise is the strongest endorsement I can give it. If you want to pay nearly two Franklins for something that sounds pretty close to a $16 thing you bought when you went to pick up motor oil, the Roam is it.","Reviewed in the United States September 18, 2022",True,96,Size: SingleColor: Black,Sonos

Got the Roam even after reading about the difficulty setting it up. It took days to sort out the issue which required my own workaround.Sonos has been trying to force the software update to the S2 app, which will not work with my older equipment. When trying to set up the Roam, I installed the S2 app, connected to a separate Wi-Fi network, but, as many users report, I could not set up a new account as any email address I entered was reported as “already in use”, which was impossible. Once I called Sonos, that issue disappeared which is suspicious. I wonder if they have something internal to prevent this.Sonos support told me to unplug all my devices, then set up the Roam on a split system which I refused to do as I did not want to risk my old equipment not working. Once you set up S2, you cannot revert back, so do not do this.I ignored their advice, and was somehow able to create the new Sonos account and activate my Roam. All that should be unnecessary for users like me that only want it for Bluetooth play.To Sonos - if you want to be in the Bluetooth market, change your software to enable Bluetooth only and stop trying to force loyal customers to the S2.

Another feature that could use improvement are the buttons. The top with the volume and mike controls are hard to see and the button on the back is a bit funky.

R3RXWRVGWBG0RV,1.0 out of 5 stars Very unhappy!,kristen,1,"First of all, I would like to say that I have never reviewed any product before. But I am so unhappy with this product that I just had to give it a poor review. I purchased two Sonos roam speakers for my small business. One for the front and one for the back of the store. And I have had nothing but problems. I chose the Sonos roam speakers because I liked the idea of being able to hook up multiple speakers wirelessly. Which seemed like it would be perfect for my store. But I tried everything to get this product to work correctly. I went through every troubleshooting procedure possible on so many different occasions with the Sonos company, that I have lost count. I can get one speaker to work correctly, but I cannot get both speakers to work at the same time with any consistency. While one speaker is working and playing music perfectly fine the other one will play music for a couple of minutes and then it will cut out for anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes and then just come back on for no apparent reason. Sometimes it’s the front speaker. Sometimes it’s the back speaker. And every now and then they will both work properly for a period of time and then all of a sudden I’m back on the phone with Sonos trying to figure out the problem. And still it does not work! So, unless you want a lot of frustration, and unless you want to be on the phone with Sonos on a regular basis, I would suggest trying a different product!","Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2024",True,3,Size: 2-PackColor: White,Sonos

This is a company who is so full of themselves that they’ve forgotten why they succeeded in the first place, which was a high quality speaker purchased and supported by loyal audiophiles like me. They have abandoned their customer base and will have a very hard time regaining our trust. After all, it costs almost nothing to maintain the original S1 and S2 controllers.

We have 4 of the play1 speakers in our home… I have a 20$ portable speaker which has fabulous battery life (like lasts about a month per full charge) and saw that Sonos came out with their own portable so we decided to get it so it can connect with the indoor speakers as well. Unfortunately if it doesn’t stay plugged in almost 100% of the time, the battery runs dead very quickly. If I take it off the charger on a Monday evening, don’t use it at all and then go to play music on it the next morning- it is dead- no music, no speaker detectable on the Sonos app. So that is disappointing. If I play it immediately after unplugging the battery will last long enough to enjoy the music but then I have to plug it in soon after. Sonos speakers are the best but I wish I had stuck to the small play 1’s that are just always plugged in- way easier for reliable and consistent ways to listen to music compared to the constant concern with battery life.","Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2021",True,11,Size: SingleColor: White,Sonos

UPDATE girlfriend bought this too, IT IS TRASH!",WH,1,"In my experience, this speaker will not hold a full charge past more than a day or 2. They say 10 days in standby, that's BS. It's like it's still on to some degree even after you press the button to turn it off. Most of the time when I went to use it it was completely dead. One time, I charged it back up and it wouldn't connect to my WiFi or let me pair it via Bluetooth to my iPhone. I had to factory reset it and set it up again.I ended up returning it. Sonos quality has gone down in recent years IMO. I don't really recommend them anymore. Multi room audio and portable audio from lots of other manufacturers has gotten just as good or better than Sonos these days.UPDATE just want to say that this device is by far the worst portable speaker I have ever seen. Unknown to me my girlfriend bought this because we were going on vacation. Getting aside from that fact that this device MUST be setup on wi-fi before it can be used (it thinks that a Hampton Inn in Miami is the ""home"" wifi), we had to reset this device no less than 6 times. Just like with mine half the time it had no battery, but even better when we would try to charge it, all we would get is a solid orange light. It would never charge, and would not turn on. If we unplugged/replugged the power tons of times, eventually it would start charging, but frequently would not connect to the wifi and would not show up in anyone's bluetooth. Can't tell you how frustrating this was, resetting the device, resetting the app, trying both of our phones. Maddening. She ended up returning it and getting a normal UE Megaboom bluetooth speaker, that thing is a joy to use and is actually reliable unlike the Sonos junk.

If I wanted to add a song to my current queue, it was a simple 2 click operation.However, for some reason, they decided to roll out an app update that eliminated all options to modify the current queue. In addition, they app has no ability to modify system settings, so when I changed my wifi password (which I do on a monthly basis), I lost the connection to all of my devices.

No, but it certainly comes very close (and sounds much better than my other portable speakers).The Bluetooth and AirPlay features are super-convenient. I was able to stream the sound for a video playing on my phone while doing some construction work in a bathroom. It even allowed me to group other speakers with it so I could stream my video’s sound to other Sonos speakers that were not AirPlay-compatible.Battery life seems to work quite well, although I tend to keep it on a Qi charger to ensure it’s always ready to go.","Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2021",True,6,Size: SingleColor: Black,Sonos

This speaker is super powerful, and packs an amazing range of quality sound. The waterproofing and portability are excellent as well. The controls and interface are fairly intuitive and easy to use.I attempted to do an unboxing video of the Zealot S78, but I was surprised by how large and sturdy this speaker is. The round shape was a little tough to keep steady while I unpacked it, but it's very stable on any flat surface. It also comes with a strong nylon shoulder strap that attaches with thick metal clips, so even given its weight and size, it's easy to carry.The speaker has all of the waterproofing features I've come to expect from the Zealot line, and promises to be a great one to use at the beach or by the pool next summer. It also doubles as a USB charging station, sharing it's long batter life with your other devices. It can play from Bluetooth, memory card, USB device, or Aux jack. This model doesn't support a microphone plugin like some other models, so it's not my first pick for portable PA system.But let me tell you -- I was literally blown away by the volume range on this thing and the quality of the sound. It connects seamlessly with our device once found, and easily streams via Bluetooth. My phone settings were set at full blast when I first hooked it up though, and I think I terrified everyone in the house when I tested it. Wow! And it wasn't overdriven either -- even at that high volume, it had clean sound with deep, rich bass tones, and crisp high tones. It's minimum volume is still clearly audible, and doesn't lose any quality.The light show is also a lot of fun, as I've come to expect from Zealot speakers. More options than some other models, as well. It also supports pairing of speakers, though I can't imagine needing a second MADBOX. Finally, it has an added ""EQ"" button that gives you a bass boost. I didn't notice a huge difference, but I will have to continue to play with it in the future and run it through its paces!I really like this one, you guys. It's certainly more expensive than other portable speakers, and heavier as well (not good for small kids), but well worth the cost!","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2024",True,5,,zealot
REGFSLZ07MI9D,"5.0 out of 5 stars Deep Bass, Clear Treble, and everything in between!",Christopher,5,"This is my THIRD Zealot speaker. At this point, you would figure that I would know what to expect. However, every single time they exceed my expectations! Usually, they are a mixture of excellent treble, bass, and an amazing light show. This one has both but delivers far more “boom” than the others. My main takeaways are:1. The deep bass is really what sets this apart from other speakers I have. However, if you’re not in the bass mood, it has three sounds modes that switch the emphasis from super bass to crystal clear treble… and everything in between!2. It’s built like a brick house. I have never owned a more physically impressive speaker. You could probably drop this from a few stories up and it would survive. It comes with a shoulder strap to make carrying it around easier.3. Its set up is extremely easy. It took me about a minute to connect via Bluetooth and have music playing. It also has the connection options of USB, AUX, and microSD.4. It has two mini subwoofers on each end that light up (different colors) in synchrony with the music. Pretty cool to watch!5. It has a long battery life and you can use it to charge other devices via the USB.6. It has dual pairing. I have no tried this yet. It can get so loud it’s hard to imagine two or three together!Overall, you get what you pay for here... and this high-quality speaker delivers. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a top-notch portable speaker that delivers on both performance and functionality.","Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2024",True,11,,zealot
R2OPN8WTNSFFVX,5.0 out of 5 stars Our walls are shaking from the thunderous booming bass!,Matrix,5,"ZEALOT once again knocks it out of the park with this speaker!!I've purchased as of today probably a dozen portable blue-tooth speakers over the past couple years from various manufacturers. ZEALOT speakers are quickly becoming a top recognized name in this area with their speakers rivaling anything from top names such as JBL, Bose, or Anker.While many of these portable speakers sound great, there is one area they all typically are lacking in.LARGE BOOMING BASS! It's the biggest problem with portable blue-tooth speakers. How do you make a speaker lightweight, yet portable, and have powerful enough batteries and drivers to give the people what they want? Because who doesn't love bass?ZEALOT seems to have figured it out with this speaker as it's no slouch in that area.With (2) 50watt Woofers on both ends this thing really rocks.Quality:The speaker is designed with a hard plastic shell. It's not made to withstand any sort of drops, but it is waterproof with an IPX6 Rating. For those unfamiliar with what that is, it's an industry standard for measuring a devices protection from solid and liquids. The definition for an IPX6 Rating is:""All devices with IPX6 rating can resist high pressures of water but can’t be submerged in the water. You can use these devices at any place where water exposure is possible but with no chance of submerging totally in water.""So basically as long as this is not submerged you have no worries from it getting wet. Perfect for around the pool, at the beach, camping, etc.Portability:This speaker does have some weight to it at around 12 pounds. It's to be expected when you have a larger speaker with the wattage this does. It's not overly heavy though to where you're agonizing over carrying it. It comes included with a heavy duty nylon strap with metal clips that make it easy to put it over a shoulder.Sound Quality :I'm impressed with the quality of the highs and lows. As the beginning of the review stated the bass for a speaker in this portable genre is excellent and the best I have tested to date. There is a button on the unit to switch modes if you prefer less bass, more vocals, higher treble, etc.Battery Life:The battery on this is rated for 40 Hours of playtime. That is one area I have not thoroughly tested as it would take weeks. From previous Zealot speakers I have owned they are pretty accurate with their battery life claims, and depending on how loud you have it you could expect more or less play time.It's nice that you can use the speaker as a power bank. So when we've had it out we bring a charge cable for our phone so while we're streaming music to the speaker the phone never runs out of battery power.It has a battery indicator on it to denote a battery %. Solid green means it's fully charged. Blinking green means over 70% charged. Red is <70% charged.Connections:This speaker comes equipped to handle Bluetooth 5.2.Bluetooth 5.2 has a range of approximately 200 meters, and utilizes Enhanced Attribute Protocol (EATT).This helps to increase stability when using your devices. 5.2 also has a new feature named “Low Energy (LE) Audio.” This feature enables high-quality and low-power audio codecs to gain maximum Bluetooth optimization. 5.3 is still fairly new and I'd hope to see it in a future release or update of this product.It also has options to connect via Aux or a TF Card if your situation works better with those options.This speaker like many others can be daisy chained is desired.I primarily used blue-tooth from my phone in testing and it connected quickly and without any issues on the first try.There are only a few items keeping this speaker from being perfect.-Bluetooth 5.3 would be a nice addition.-Digital Battery Indicator- I have some concern the woofers on the end are open. They do not have any grids or mesh covering them so puncture is potentially possible if not taken caution when handling.Overall Conclusion:This is a very solid speaker with a lot going for it. I'm very impressed with everything about it.Our kids fight over who gets to bring it to hockey games for the locker-room. We've had it camping and had it last the entire weekend on a single charge keeping everyone entertained. Everyone always is commenting about the high sound quality. You can crank the volume without distortion due to the power it has. It has various light modes which are always a hit with the kids. I'm impressed with this ZEALOT speaker and I highly recommend if you're looking for a speaker of this size to stop waiting and order one today!","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024",True,4,,zealot

Because literally this thing could sound Let alone be even better if it literally just got some retuning here and there, mainly in the bass boost mode. Bass boost has quite an amount of distortion at higher volumes. You can hear the overdrive like literally. All it has to do is be dialed down a little.

R27NIV0HUKNJ9Q,5.0 out of 5 stars It’s all about that bass,SolidReviews,5,"I’ve got a number of speakers, and this has the best bass hands-down. The treble is still extremely clear.The volume range is insane. Similarly-sized speakers have nowhere near the output.A positive is that it connects to my Samsung TV without issue. Some older speakers won’t connect, but this one connects without issue. I’m tempted to use this as a giant soundbar for my TV (it’s that good, and it makes my living room sound like a movie theater).The only thing I don’t like a ton is the lights, but they can be turned off, and I suppose it’s not bad to have them available if you use the speaker at a party at night or out camping for example.Overall, this is the best speaker I own. There’s no reason to buy anything other than this one if you’re looking for a loud, clear speaker that has a ton of bass available via the equalizer feature.","Reviewed in the United States April 23, 2024",True,1,,zealot

Waterproof by design, it features a carrying handle and hooks for use with a supplied strap. The S78 pairs easily and features great stereo separation when used alone, and of course can be paired with additional speakers. LED lighting features are a plus, but the real beauty of this speaker is the amazing sound. The built in equalizer will produce amazing highs, but the bass is phenomenal as powered by the 120W woofer design. I took it outside to see how it performed in my patio/yard area, and it didn't disappoint. I have nothing negative to say about the Zealot S78.

It has 3 different light modes, you can also pair it with multiple other speakers which is really cool. Once turned on it immediately showed up in my bluetooth list and connected very easily once I clicked on it. The deep bass is great and easy one click to turn it on/off. The carrying strap plus the handle is HUGE with the speaker being as large as it is for easy transport.

R18M0JBQKX6RST,"5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic! High quality speaker...amazing sound, strong bass, long battery life. Sturdy build. A+",EET,5,"After buying Bluetooth speakers for my kids, I finally decided to get one for myself, and purchased the Zealot Madbox speaker. This has turned out to be my favorite of all as it is a very solidly constructed, substantial speaker.First off, the sound is amazing! At full volume, this speaker really pumps out the sound, but with no distortion. The bass is very strong, and Zealot included a 3-setting equalizer option to enable you to customize the sound to your liking. Although the sound at high volume is impressive, so is the output at lower volumes. Often speakers do not sound good except when turned all the way up, but this speaker sounds great at lower volumes, with clear sound and nice bass. Zealot advertises this as 120 watts of output, and I can attest to that performance.There are so many thoughtful features included with this speaker that really make it a perfect device. The control panel is backlit, which makes it very easy to adjust even in the dark. The battery status is represented by a LED strip that illuminates red, yellow, or green to indicate how much batter life remains, which makes it easy to see when I need to recharge. The control panel includes the following buttons:- Play/Pause- Two multi-function buttons for changing tracks and adjusting volume (short press to change volume up or down, and long press to move to next/previous tracks)- A button to adjust the equalizer settings (with three modes that include backlighting to indicate which mode you are using)- Mode button to change between BT / TF card / Aux input / USB input- A button to control the lighting effects on the ends of the speaker, switching between 2 light patterns and off- Pairing button, which enables you to pair multiple Madbox speakers together for even more sound. I believe the documentation says you can pair up to 100 speakers together, which would be amazing, if not really expensive!The speaker is advertised as IP67 waterproof, so it will withstand rain or waves. The control panel is sealed, and the accessory port cover on the back is thick and secure so no water gets in. The ports on the back include USB-C power in, USB-A plug for attaching a memory stick or phone, an AUX-in jack for directly plugging in a device, and a TF card slot for loading your own music.In addition to all these features, the speaker serves as a power bank for charging phones, earbuds, or anything else with a USB power cable. The listing claims a 40-hour battery life and that seems to be the case, as I only need to rarely charge it.This speaker weighs close to 12 pounds, so Zealot wisely included a sturdy carrying handle and a carry strap.In summary, this is an incredibly well-built speaker with great sound and very thoughtful included features. I am thrilled with this purchase and have been using it every day.","Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2024",True,4,,zealot

It’s a truly immersive sound experience, you can enjoy any type of music, if you like me that jumps from different genres of music…it sounds unbelievable, it delivers crisps high notes, clean deep sound and most of all the deep bass sound is what really makes the difference, it has three sounds modes that you can play with it, depending on your taste, you going to love this speaker.

R3ED0R4VCG7DP7,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Speaker for All Needs,Colin,5,"I was in need of a new versatile portable speaker to fit my summer adventures; one that was portable enough to fit in a beach bag and left in my car or to play out in my pool area that packed a punch in sound. After a week of owning this speaker, all in all it has checked every box.TLDR: This speaker, while a tiny bit smaller than what I was expecting, packs amazing sound quality from a trusted brand to easily liven up any outdoor occasion. Their app is great for EQ settings, however the physical ULT button provided great boost to your music by itself to hype up any outdoor event. Waterproofing is great and holds a good charge while being extremely portable with its carrying strap.Packaging:- The speaker arrived in a regular cardboard box. While it was nice to see Sony turn to the newer trend of making packaging as recyclable as possible, I did notice that the pieces holding the speaker were flimsy and could possibly be a concern during delivery. However, mine thankfully arrived in perfect condition. Included inside the box was the speaker itself with the carrying band already attached, a USB A to USB C charging cable, and a very small paper pamphlet. Instructions for the speaker are found through a scanned QR code within this pamphlet which allowed for more information about the speaker to be addressed.Sound Quality:- As to no surprise from this being from Sony, this speaker sounds amazing. It doesn’t get tinny at higher volumes, the dual drivers create amazing bass, and overall it covers all genres with no issue presenting truly enjoyable melodies for all music. At max volume, while the speaker does not get deafening loud if you are outdoors (indoors it possibly will depending on what you define as deafening lol), it certain gets loud enough to entertain a large area. In my 40 foot by 120 foot patio, this speaker shined and was the center piece of great sound quality and entertainment. While it certain suits my needs for loudness, you can always take it a notch up by either using the ULT button or pairing it with a second ULT Field 1 and working them in stereo (both discussed in features).Features:- This speaker is packed with all of the expected features of a modern Bluetooth speaker. It quickly connects to remembered devices when powered on (one nice little note: to power on/off this device, only a single press of the power button is needed for each. While a small detail, it truly is something that is appreciated for ease of use) and has a great battery life. While I cannot speak for the full I’ve gone 6 hours of using the speaker which left it at 50%, so I believe their claim of 12 hours of battery life to be true. This speaker also has a quick charger feature of 10 mins of charging for 3 hours of playback. I haven’t tested that myself as of yet, but I have other newer Song products with similar fast charging features and their claims for those products have not fallen short, so I believe these ones as well.- There is also a Bluetooth pairing button, a multiple use button that can play/pause tracks, skip/reverse tracks, and answer/hang up phone calls depending on need. Functionality was clearly a forethought of this speaker, since this button’s commands—while certainly vast—are greatly designed. Play/pause is a single press, skip is a double press, reverse is a triple press, and it converts to a call answer/hang up button with a single press functionality when you receive a call. There are also independent volume up/down buttons which increase the volume by a decent percentage in each press.- Then there is the ULT button, which is a built in EQ adjustment presented as a physical button on the speaker. It comes with default settings when pressed that noticeably enhance the all around sound quality of any melody, with an emphasis on bass and treble. The EQ for the ULT button can be adjusted in the Sony Music Center app. It’s a great feature to use when you want to give that extra boost to your music.- While I have not tried it myself, this speaker also has the ability to be set in stereo with a second ULT speaker, and I’m sure the dual speaker combination could easily work as a stereo set up for any venue needs.- The waterproofing of this speaker is on par with expectations. I’ve taken it to many water-based areas and have gotten it splashed with water and it’s been completely fine. The USB C charging port is covered with a water tight seal that you can open and close easily.- This speaker works with Sony’s music center app, and while it’s a bit rougher than their headphone app, it still works wonderfully to optimize the speaker’s functionality and performance. Full EQ settings are available, along with specific battery percentage, updates, and settings for the speaker.- The included carrying strap is a nice touch that, I will admit I did not initially think I was going to like, however it very quickly grew on me and I find myself carrying the speaker solely by the strap anywhere I take it. It is tied onto the speaker and can be removed, however you will have to re-tie it yourself if you want to reattach it.Build Quality:- Once again, as expected from this price point and the Song brand, this is truly a high quality speaker. It feels great to hold, with the fabric being sturdy and made of soft material. The buttons are covered in strong rubber that give a satisfying response when pushed. The carrying strap is thick and made of a high quality and very slightly elastic material. You are certainly getting your money’s worth on quality alone, which is what I expect from the Song brand.Final Thoughts:- While it is certainly understandable to hesitant when looking at a $120 Bluetooth speaker, this one truly is worth its value. I have very little complaints with this speaker, and think that it’s a great edition to anyone’s outdoor entertainment experience. The ULT button is a feature I find myself using more than expected (in a good way) to help boost my music during gatherings to help the entertainment. With its waterproofing, I feel comfortable using it as a travel speaker to any destination I plan on visiting. This feature packed speaker is truly one of a kind, and I’m certainly satisfied with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",True,25,Color: Off White,Sony

R3MI1MH02YEDHK,5.0 out of 5 stars Things I wish I knew before I bought this.,Pat,5,"The media could not be loaded. So, yes 5 stars, and I mean that. To cut to the chase, this is an excellent speaker, and you should get one!Now, I usually do not post reviews, but I thought if you knew all this, it would help you understand why I gave it 5 stars and recommend it so highly!SOUNDIt sounds way bigger than it looks. The ULT button adds a lot of bass and I love that! It is great for EDM, Hip hop, R&B, 80s, 90s,... I tried basically everything I could, and it all sounded great. Even added a little more depth to a classical cello playlist I listen to while I am working.If you like a less bass-heavy sound, just turn the ULT feature off, and it will sound excellent. If that does not suit you, there is a 3-band EQ in the app.OH, and it sounds just as good standing up as it does lying down!!APPAs mentioned, there is an EQ in there!! You can also change other settings and even see the battery life, which I could not believe was still 60% after a couple of days of me casually using it! Super surprised because I never charged it when I got it!Oh, I also noticed the ""group with other speakers,"" and apparently, you can pair another one of these and get stereo sound out of them.... I have not tried that, but I will as soon as I get my second one!STRAPThis was one I was really unsure about when looking at it online. The strap is genius! It can tighten or loosen and then stay in place. My little one liked to carry it around like a purse, but it is really versatile, and I found I could hang it one way or another everywhere I went.DESIGNAgain the design is great, it is very stable standing up or lying down. The buttons are easy to use and because they are raised, you can use them without even looking at them.The SONY logo on the front looks silver most of the time but actually has some... I don't know what, but it changes color, which is a nice touch. See pics.Love the Forest Grey color, it is exactly as expected. A subtle green/grey that I have gotten a lot more comments on than I ever though I would.LIFE/KID-PROOF!Ok, so I like music in the shower, and let me tell you... this thing delivers, even when it got wet it still sounded clear. I did not need to have it at full volume either.Of course, my girls heard it, and when it was bath time, they wanted to have it with them. That is when I discovered it could float!! Now it does not sound great that way, but it still played even after multiple ""accidental"" dunks in the tub! They also loved to see what they could put on the woofer part, and see it dance and fall out.Lastly it is stink proof, as well as mud, sand and waterproof... My daughters and I clean the pond behind our house, usually after big storms, and pick up plastic and other garbage we find. My 6 yo, who likes to hold the speaker as a purse, thought it would be a great idea to bring ""Ultra"" (that is what they named it) with us while we did so. As expected, it dropped into the stinky pond muck when a dragonfly landed on it, and she screamed and tossed it like a live grenade...after fishing it out, I rinsed it off with some dawn and the water hose and it was good as new.To say this has held up remarkably well is an understatement. It looks great, sounds great, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a portable speaker.

RJFBE7W2A9HWL,5.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly Great!,Fabian,5,"What I was looking for was a compact bluetooth speaker that packs a punch in bass, so I decided to give this Sony speaker a try and boy was I surprised by it! 1. Bluetooth pairing - First, pairing this was super easy. I happen to have an Android phone and once bluetooth is on, it automatically pops up on my phone and asks if I want to pair it.2. Design - for a compact size speaker, it is really lightweight and because the speaker is shaped the way it is, it can easily stand up by itself or laid out sideways. The tether that comes with it can easily be strapped on to my backpack or a bicycle.3. Bass - The sound varies depending on the position of the speaker, but the bass is surprisingly good! The secret here is the ""ult"" button. Once you press that, it really amps up the bass while not sacrificing the clarity of the vocals. What I thought was cool was the companion app that you can use to control the speaker in which you can also customize the sound through the equalizer. I am not too picky when it comes to sound, but the opportunity to customize it will be super flexible for those who like their own sound.4. Sound Quality and Distance - This to me was the main reason why I am giving it 5 stars. The sound quality has really good range from the low tones to the high tones. I like to listen to the variety of different styles of music and I am very impressed of the sound reproduction of this speaker. Usually, I am not too far away from the speaker, but there had been times where I had to go downstairs to do something and what's nice is that the speaker had really good range for a bluetooth speaker. The sound never cut out once. As a bonus, what I discovered in the app, was an option to either turn on sound quality performance or focus on a stable connection and I think that will allow some people to really enjoy their music even from a far away distance.5. Price - $128 is still a lot of money, but for this amount of money and what I am getting from this speaker. I say it is well worth it because I can take this literally anywhere outside or inside. There have been a couple of times when my phone was paired to the speaker and somebody called in and I had a conversation with them not knowing I can actually talk to them from the speaker! So yes, if you can afford this speaker, I say give this a try! You won't be disappointed!","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",True,15,Color: Black,Sony

R2SOQ8N1C3X1JM,5.0 out of 5 stars Did JBL just lose?,Itryditm8,5,"The ULT field 1 is an incredible compact speaker. My Go-to was always the JBL flip series, as i right now own the flip 6.Design: The utility here is great, it has a carry strap that doubles as a hanger, or a handle!, the build is very rugged and high quality, i would not baby this thing at all, it handles its own!Sound & Performance: Out of the box the speaker comes with ULT on, and WOAH!, it gets very loud for its size!. This speaker connects to sony’s music center app, where you can customize the eq, connect in stereo to another field 1, and many other settings!. The sound is very open, clear on vocals ,it fills up a big room really well and maps the sound out. A really great sounding speaker. Battery life is really good,it varies how you use it, but real world use ( 50-80% volume, ULT on) its good for 8-10 hours straight. It does take a while to charge, about 5 hours if its completely drained. But thats good for the overall life of the battery.Compared to JBL flip 6: Ive been back forth between these two for the past couple days. And i found myself reaching for the field 1! It sounds better, its more open, it sounds like the music fills up any room, as for the JBL, it targets the sound directly at you, and the highs are a bit harsh, sony simply just outperforms it!Value: at retail ($128).

R2LXPDPJ7ZTXGE,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Poolside Speaker,E.J,5,"First off, I have 4 college age children so over the years we have gone through our share of portable speakers. So when Sony announced their new lineup and after reading a couple of early reviews I decided to take a chance on the new ULT1. As for the looks this ""Gator"" orange color is great. It stands out and it's exactly what I was looking for and when turning it on the first time it immediately notified my phone which made pairing simple. The design is perfect with the ""handle"" in the right spot and when I did my ""can it float test"" it righted itself every time and didn't loose a beat! As for that handle, at first it comes off a bit odd but once you realize it's dual purpose it's fairly cool. In terms of size it's about as good as it gets, as it's small enough to fit in a cup holder but big enough to feel substantial. Now for what counts. The sound quality is fantastic! As many other speakers in the same class I was expecting moderate performance but the sound was crisp, but not tin canish and the bass was great for a speaker this size. Out of the box it has the ULT boost on but you can shut it off with a touch of a button. From a durability standpoint the edges seem stout and could probably handle the inevitable drops to come! Finally as for the battery it lasted all afternoon on Mother's Day in the unforgiving Florida heat and humidity so I'd say it will do it's job on a beach day as well. All in all I'm very happy with the ULT1 and I'm looking forward to the enjoyment it will bring my family!","Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2024",True,4,Color: Orange,Sony

R18S17G392OP4Q,5.0 out of 5 stars EXCELLENT Speaker 🔊 👏,Debbie,5,"We were on the market for a bluetooth portable speaker for our 18 year old daughter as a birthday present. We normally gravitate to the JBL brand - which ARE, and still remain to be, great speakers. But, being the baby of the family and living with hand-me-down [you name it]s all her life, I knew she'd appreciate a speaker in a style that was totally her own -- not another one of mom and dad's (or big brother's) speakers. Fun and easy as that sounds, this meant stepping out of my comfort zone. (You know how it is: you like what you like!) So I REALLY did my homework by researching many different brands/styles/specs (Bose, Beats, etc.) of speakers in the (about $100-150) price range. The number one thing our daughter was asking for was portability - hesitantly saying nothing bigger than her brother's JBL Charge 4, but I could tell smaller would be better. Bigger speakers may give better sound, but she wanted a ""water bottle speaker"" as they're called because they fit nicely in cup holders. So I began my search by comparing models to JBL's Flip 6 - the one I was originally going to purchase. I came across this Sony ULT Field 1, which is a new model that Sony released just a few months ago. I was impressed by it's veratility. Built the same way as the Flip 6 (outward facing woofer and tweeter, side bass) it has many of the same features as the Flip 6 like an app with an equalizer so you can fine tune your music and 12 hours of battery life. But the Field 1 came with a few extra features that raised my eyebrow... A ULT bassboost button giving you an extra, little option: go with a deeper bass if you're dancin' the night away - or turn it off if you're, say, talking with friends around a campfire and save on battery life. (By the way, it sounds GREAT even with it off!) It also comes with a phyical pause button and voice feature - where you can answer the phone through the speaker, (like in your car). Although it IS bigger than the Flip 6 it is smaller than the JBL Charge 5 - the newer version of her brother's speaker. As far as sound quality, several reviewers (YouTube) stated that the Field 1's sound quality falls BETWEEN JBL's Flip 6 and Charge 5 models. (I used my headphones to listen while they demonstrated the different speakers' sounds and, yes... uh-huh... I agree.) Again, ALL 3 speakers have very, VERY good sound quality - you really can't go wrong with any of them. We were looking at Sony's ULT Field 1 simply because we wanted to give our daughter something unique to our household - that fit her description of ""bottle speaker"" but measured up to my (ha!) standards of sound quality. I also want to point out (on a petty note) that we DO LIKE the carrying cord - a feature I thought at first glance might be awkward. It can be removed if desired but lemme tell ya, it's QUITE handy! :D So I added it to my cart, did that lil' 'hold-your-breath' pause thing we all do ...then tapped the 'ORDER' button. It arrived today (very next day) and, wanting to surprise her [a month] early, went ahead and handed her the package. (Sigh...gone are the days of my elegant gift wrapping sessions.) The surprise alone tickled her - but when she opened it, her eyes grew WIDE! She genuinely LOVED it!! (May I be clear here: I couldve given her a cleaned up, secondhand, garage sale speaker and she, in her sweet-nature, would have ""LOVED"" that. Ha! Ha! It was a sweet treat to do this for her.) 😄🥲I asked if the size was too big and she said it was very much OK! Now, my picky ears are truly impressed by it's CLEAR sound - even turned ALL the way up, there's no ""fuzziness"" here! I had chosen the white color and it's very nice. It's not a sporty, bright white - just kind of a classy, muted off-white. One thing I DO like over the JBL brand is that the buttons have little, lights by each one so they'll be more easily seen in the evenings. (Cool!😎) Connectivity was easy - or so I assume. She had it out if the box and connected to her iPhone faster than I could say ""Wait; there's an app..."". She was already downloading the app and was playing music as I sat at down at the table to look it all over. So I'm feeling pretty confident to say it's easy to set up. As far as fitting in the cup holder, it does fit...kind of. It sits about 2½ inches down - snuggly enough to keep it securely upright while driving, but not all the way seated down inside it. Our car's cupholders (Ford Escape) have these little spring loaded, retractable, grabber things that prevent it from being seated all the way down inside. Bump it with your elbow and it'll go flying. That said, it still may fit in YOUR cupholders.It definitely will fit the (Ford) truck's cupholders. Lol!She loved the speaker so much though, it wasn't a deal breaker!After all that - go figure! (RME) But, hey!...that just tells you how good this speaker is!!) Overall, it is very much a sweet little speaker for its size and price point! (Way to go, Sony!) As they say in other Amazon reviews: ""If you're on the fence give it a try - you will be pleasantly surprised.""(🤔Hmmm...Let's see...MY birthday is in March...) 😄","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2024",True,0,Color: Off White,Sony
R1P2OVKCR03MLZ,5.0 out of 5 stars New Sony drop is perfect for budget audiophiles,BB,5,"If you're on the fence, get this! I was looking for a new speaker to replace my old UE Boom that had a static tick in it (love UE, but every speaker I've had goes this route eventually).This new portable Sony speaker didn't have the thousands of reviews that more expensive (or cheaper and well-known but risker) speakers had. However, every review was positive and they were right (so far). Though I've only had this about a month, it's been a massive improvement in my home and away music setup. The sound is gorgeous. The bass is clear and deep. I'm sure audiophiles can find a $1000 speaker that will be tuned to perfection, but for music fans without those funds (and who need a trusty travel speaker) this is the one.The forest green/grey looks cool and shows off how well-made it is.Only potential con so far is that it takes a while to shut off by itself. I don't have the Sony app so maybe this is a setting you can change. It's by no means a problem, unless you are banking on it shutting itself off. The connection lasts even if your music app closes which is nice.The rope handle also makes it so you can't just slam it down; it has to be the right orientation. It's tied loosely though, so you could untie it for more position flexibility, you'd just have a longer string to carry it.I am very particular and this speaker checked all my boxes! 10/10 recommend.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",True,3,Color: Forest Gray,Sony

R1J0P8850HKH5G,5.0 out of 5 stars IT REALLY FLOATS!,PeninaD,5,"First thing I did, after ensuring it was charged [then firmly closed the port seal] and checked that it was able to successfully link to my smartphone, was to toss this into the freshwater lake I was about to kayak in.Floated, and worked perfectly every since. Love this highly visible color, just in case it ever falls overboard. And it matches our kayak.And the charge level barely moved even after 1.5 hours of use (not blasting loudly, but ULT was in use. )The price was amazing during Amazon Prime Days.","Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2024",True,0,Color: Orange,Sony
RARW9ZM6Q1LZT,5.0 out of 5 stars Super impressive sound in a small package!,Franco F,5,"After 10 years of getting tossed around and used in the rain or humid environments, I had to retire my trusty Bose mini sound link 2. I have been looking for a replacement for some time but found most options lacking, especially in matching the Bose’s bass. However, from the first listen, these blew me away. They sound clean, can get very loud, amazing battery life but most of all they have unbelievably great bass from such a small package! It’s a bit bigger than the Bose but is actually lighter and overall build quality is excellent, with some nice details. The ULT mode is awesome and the connection is strong, even through walls or far away when outside. I love the orange but I am mindful that it is a cloth cover with semi-exposed tweeters on the ends, so I’d recommend a case or something if taking it to dirty environments or in a bag mixed with sharp things. The rubber on both sides does leave me comfortable that if this falls it won’t be any issue, plus it works well for placing vertically in tight spaces. Overall, can highly recommend and would say it’s no comparison to the UE boom, Bose sound link flex or Beats Pill I had previously tried.","Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2024",True,4,Color: Orange,Sony

Secondly the speaker is THE best looking ""mini"" speaker . So functional the rope strappy thing is amazing. I honestly thing this is better compared to the JBL charge not the JBL flip, I think Sony just dropped JBL . The part that sucks is that you gotta get another Field 1 for stereo while JBL can partner up with any other JBL.You can use the custom EQ to get the Sound louder and clearer or atleast to you liking. The way I use it is ULT mode off for podcasts, ULT on for normal music at low volumes and custom on for party mode with MAX bass. if you know how to place this speaker in the room, like higher up you get pure bliss.Love it !","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",True,1,Color: Off White,Sony
R13AU9YKA0520K,4.0 out of 5 stars Best used if ULT feature turned off,When I got the XP 500 the box was damaged but the speaker was fine but it sounds best if you keep it plugged in cuz running off its internal battery it don't get as loud relative to its size so it sounds fine just mainly want to use it while it's plugged in,4,So I bought this new ULT field 7 and overall it sounds really good the highs sound pretty detailed but the mids sound very full which surprised me you hear a good left in our Channel without no problem my only issue is that when you turn the Ult on it can have a chance of blowing out your speaker does this speaker hits pretty low frequencies which is quite impressive but dangerous for a small speaker so I recommend using it while the u l t is turned off and just put it to custom and set your bass like down 3 clicks other than that the speaker sounds great it's a good travel size and you won't be disappointed of its performance.,"Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2024",True,0,Color: Black,Sony

R294Q4QN96UURC,5.0 out of 5 stars Magnificent Comeback by Sony with the ULT Field 1,Lu,5,"Wow, Sony! What a magnificent comeback. This is the best-sounding speaker I've encountered at this size and price. The hourglass shape is great for palming it. Initially, I didn't think I'd like the strap, but I love how tight it is—making it a perfect handle. The speaker can seamlessly stand or sit facing you or directly up to disperse the sound evenly. Doing a Hz test next to one of my Charge 5’s, it easily competes. I did these tests on my mattress to better feel the vibration of each unit. The Sony produced noticeably more vibration than the Charge 5, which blew my mind. Supposedly designed to compete with the Flip 6, it's, in my opinion, better than my Charge 5. Whatever Sony’s engineers are doing, they hit a home run. The clarity is wild, the bass response is wild, and the ULT button sounds like it’s unleashing the Iron Giant, and I’m here for that. Most speakers don't appear on my “connected devices” widget, but this one does. After listening for the last 4 hours at about 50% volume with ULT turned on, I only lost 20% of the battery. Bluetooth connection is swift, taking about 3 seconds from pressing the power button to streaming audio from your connected device. I purchased the orange ULT Field 1. Normally, I go for neutral colors like white, gray, or black, but this orange really pops and looks sweet. It comes with a short 12” Sony-branded USB-A to USB-C charging cable. Sony, you should hook us up with 3-foot cables. Sony has truly outdone themselves with the ULT Field 1. The combination of design, performance, and features makes it a standout speaker in its category. Highly recommended!","Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2024",True,5,Color: Orange,Sony

I was looking for days for a new speaker because my other one got jacked I had the Bose sound link mini which also is a great speaker but compared to the new model or this Sony xlt model I was torn. 1 I know how Bose is so I was like damn but I was looking into Sony and only because I was thinking of getting a tv and ppl who had Sony talked highly. There are so many Sony speakers and different price points. This speaker sounded like you had a subwoofer and connected speakers at a party that’s how the quality was in this mini speaker. It’s water proof the strap was better than expected I didn’t care for it but now I can attach to my surroundings environment it’s like an extra nice touch. The app you download is not needed to play or connect it’s just nice if u have multiple speakers to connect gives you battery info etc. the charging is usb C and it fast charging. I just got this speaker and I’m writing a review this shows how excited and amazed I am still ha. The Price for the speaker well it’s definitely worth it. 1 u can buy two for under 300 vers 1 speaker for that price and have surround sound. The to speakers that come in this one price is worth it buy it if you are thinking about it. No jack cable I don’t have anything that needs it so I’m good haha.

My teenage son has always been a hard sell on design. He was sold. The shiny Sony logo caught his attention immediately.I was surprise on the sound quality. This is me speaking from comparing to a different Sony speaker I've owned in the past (xb23 is the model number, I think).The ""cool factors"" for me were: 1. push the ULT button to enhance the bass and clear highs that really bring out the music while hanging out in the backyard. 2. Strap - It allows me to hang the speaker on the patio umbrella and out of the way of things (see pic). 3. Setting it up was a breeze. Wifey opened up the box, push the power button, paired the bluetooth, all on her own. Lastly, what really stood out to me was how well-built this speaker is. It feels sturdy and durable, but it's lightweight enough to take with me wherever I go. Plus, the sleek design looks great.Haven't had it long enough to noticed any ""cons"" about this speaker. If I were to say something, I'd say price. I purchased the speaker at regular price because I needed a second unit for our backyard.

JBL has always sounded hollow to me like I was missing half the sound. Now I realize it's just a small speaker but Sony made me realize I have been missing something. If you want great sound quality Sony does it best. The design is killer I currently have it on my island in the kitchen and it's super easy to connect with my iPhone.

Most of my past speakers with a boost button basically increased bass. It’s fine if that’s all you want, but the equalization isn’t there. The bass over-powers the voice or the other instruments. This ULT button gives you more bass - check , and the other sounds also get enhanced. It’s pretty remarkable. The strap is cool. I can hang it from the table umbrella in my back yard. Porting the side speakers was smart. You can use it horizontal like normal or when you stand it vertically, the bottom speaker isn’t fully covered. The air can go somewhere. I think Sony has a winner here. This is definitely coming pool side and beach side on our next trip to FLA. I got the white color. Looks good. I’m glad I picked this one. It’s definitely a keeper.Oh, all the other good stuff. Easy to connect to iPhone. 12 hour battery is very good for me and small for its power. Also works as a speaker phone and all the proofs.

R3AK5LLZ1VVTWJ,"5.0 out of 5 stars INSANE Speaker! Quality, volume, battery, and features make this THE BEST!",Jeremy,5,"The JBL Charge 5 is the BEST speaker I have ever owned. I have had the average run-of-the-mill bluetooth speaker that has around a $20 value, for over a year, and I thought it was good sound quality, and I never thought I needed something “fancy.” Well, that speaker started having problems, and I was carefully searching for another speaker. I found this speaker and I thought I would try something new. I only had one thought as I played music out of it for the first time. WOW! The JBL Charge 5 has the best sound quality I had ever heard from a bluetooth speaker. I don’t ever plan on getting another speaker; that is, a speaker that isn’t JBL or an upgraded version of the Charge 5. The clarity is absolutely stunning! The bass is DEEP. I can feel the bass through my whole room! The volume is insane. I rarely have it over 50%, but in the event where I need it louder, I turn it up. I once had music filling a whole event center that was quite a reasonable size. If I could choose one word to describe this speaker, it would be “Stunning,” “Powerful,” or “Supercharged!(Pun intended.)” On that note, the battery life on this thing is long! I once had the speaker provide some background noise for about two days and the battery life was barely lower than 70% (I think…it’s hard to tell exactly with the battery indicator; definitely above 60%). Of course, the battery drains quicker when you have the speaker playing at high volumes. Also, it can take some water. Some being a little, I prefer not to put it to the test. Here is my takeaway:DESIGN: 9/10 Great! I love the fabric covering. The JBL logo is made of metal, which makes it look very nice and official. The buttons are easy to distinguish, and the light is on the power, bluetooth, and there is a ring of light around those two buttons when PartyBoost is in effect. There is a battery bar right below the JBL Logo, and it serves as a general battery indicator. You can get the 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. You can get more info on the battery via the app. The weight is surprisingly light, considering the volume this speaker is capable of. Although, it isn’t the most portable of portable speakers as it is a little big and has a football shape. You can get a case for it that has a strap though. For the skip feature, you have to press the play/pause button twice. Make sure that when you do this, you maintain a consistent interval of time between the two presses. If you do it too fast it will just pause. If you do it too slow, it will just pause then play again.BATTERY: 10/10 Perfect! I absolutely love the battery. I’m the kind of person that prefers the longest possible battery, and doing whatever it takes to preserve it. I don’t have to worry much about this battery. Like I said, it has provided some low music for almost 2 days and the battery wasn’t that affected. However, the battery life will drain much more rapidly when using the speaker at high volumes. I currently use this speaker with a projector to watch TV. I have watched lots of movies and TV shows, and I don’t have to pay much attention to the battery. I just plug it in every other night, and it does great! And having a battery bank is the cherry on top. I haven’t used it much, as I keep most of my devices fully charged, but I think it is awesome that it has a battery bank if I need it.SOUND QUALITY: 10/10(10.5/10) Stunning! I didn’t expect that sound quality could get this good for a bluetooth speaker. JBL means business! When I turn it to high volumes, I can actually feel air blowing from it! On that note, it can go REALLY high in volume. I did not expect that at all. Insane volume. As stated earlier, I use this with a projector, and for all my TV. Watching movies with this speaker makes the entire experience cinematic! A much bigger upgrade compared to the sound TV’s come with. I would even say that it can contend with some soundbars out there (not the JBL Surround Sound System though…that one seems like the top-tier of JBL). This speaker was my first experience with JBL speakers (other than the car speakers) and I was very impressed. It has been the best sound experience I have ever had. Really clear and crisp audio, and when I say “really,” I mean truly! When playing music, I can hear every instrument, every breath, and incredible bass. The bass is a superstar in and of itself. Like I said, the bass shakes my whole room when playing music, and when watching movies! The side radiators really, really pack a punch! There is even an adjustable EQ on the app. Though I prefer what the speaker came with. It is a little pricey, (just a little) but know that you get what you pay for! I don’t think that I can ever go back to what I had…PARTYBOOST: 9/10 Great! I had one, so I bought two more so I could create a surround sound with my TV. It kinda worked. I think I had some sort of connectivity issue, so all I’ll say is that the range might not be that great, so make sure you keep them somewhat close. If you have a projector that has bluetooth and you want to use PartyBoost, I would consider researching what you can do with the Bluetooth latency (As stated earlier, I watch TV with this, and please note there IS some lag between sound and video, as bluetooth will do. However, that is just bluetooth technology, not JBL. Over time my ears and eyes have adjusted, and now it is not that big a deal). In addition to standard bluetooth latency, PartyBoost will make this delay greater (I ended up returning the other two because of this issue). For music, this is not a problem, because it is just sound and no video. With music, PartyBoost is pretty cool! It really creates a much louder and much cooler sound experience. You can even use just two for a stereo effect, and it works great!Overall, this has been the BEST bluetooth speaker experience I have ever had. You better believe I’ll be there for the Charge 6 or 7 or wherever they decide to take this. They really have something good going here. I would 110% recommend this! If you are reading this review, and you would like an upgrade to your typical listening experience, know that this is one of the best out there! And if you catch this at a discounted price, you’ll know you are getting a great deal. JBL has been the best listening experience for me. I will continue buying their products if they keep supplying a high-quality experience. I mean, let the 27,000 ratings with a 4.8 overall rating speak for itself. Here is a simplified pro-con list:PROS-Excellent audio clarity-Excellent bass-Excellent overall sound-Exceptional volume-Long battery life-Battery bank feature-Waterproof feature-Adjustable EQ-Stereo Effect-PartyBoost for multiple speakersCONS-Button timing for the skip track-Could be slightly more portable (We do have the Flip speakers for that though)","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2024",True,78,Color: Black,Bose
R158T5SJCSV7IQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Sound and Great Durability,Miguel Gomez,5,"The media could not be loaded. I recently got my hands on the JBL CHARGE 5 Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker, and I have to say, it’s been an awesome addition to my music setup. Whether I’m chilling at home, heading to the beach, or just hanging out in the backyard, this speaker has been delivering on all fronts.First off, let’s talk about the sound quality. It’s impressive! The audio is clear and crisp, making everything from podcasts to my favorite tracks sound fantastic. The bass is particularly noteworthy – it’s deep and punchy without being overwhelming. I’ve had other portable speakers before, but this one definitely stands out in terms of delivering that full, rich sound we all crave.The build quality of the JBL CHARGE 5 is also top-notch. It feels solid and durable, which is exactly what you need in a portable speaker. I’m not the gentlest person with my gadgets, so knowing this speaker can withstand a bit of rough handling is a huge plus. The waterproof feature is a game-changer too. I’ve taken it to the pool and the beach, and it’s held up perfectly fine even after getting splashed. No worries about a bit of water ruining the fun.Another awesome feature is the battery life. With up to 20 hours of playtime, this speaker keeps the party going all day and night. And the powerbank USB charge-out is a lifesaver! I can charge my phone on the go, which is super handy during long outings or when I forget to charge my phone beforehand. JBL PartyBoost is another cool feature that lets you pair multiple JBL speakers for an even bigger sound. I haven’t tried it yet, but it sounds like a blast for larger gatherings.Honestly, I’ve struggled to find any real cons with this speaker. It’s a bit on the heavier side, but considering the sound quality and battery life, it’s a trade-off I’m happy to make. The price is a bit higher compared to some other portable speakers, but you’re definitely getting what you pay for in terms of quality and performance.In conclusion, the JBL CHARGE 5 is a fantastic portable speaker that’s worth every penny. With clear, clean sound, excellent bass, and high-quality materials, it’s perfect for anyone looking to amp up their music experience. Whether you’re an audiophile or just someone who loves good tunes on the go, this speaker won’t disappoint. Highly recommended!","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2024",True,27,Color: Black,Bose

I first bought the JBL Pulse 5 speaker awhile back, and I really love that one, especially for the light show it can do, but it's a little large to pack up and haul. Then I bought the JBL Flip 6 which is smaller, but still can pack a nice punch... but only if you turn it up really loud. I really love the JBL Flip 6 because it is extremely portable, but I decided that I wanted to try this JBL Charge 5 because I love the camouflage pattern on it, and it seemed like a good in-between speaker from the other two speakers I'm comparing here. As it turns out, the JBL Charge 5 is the best choice for me in terms of portability, and sound. It's got a really nice full sound, and I don't have to turn it up quite as loud as the JBL Flip 6 to achieve the full sound I like. That means to me that I have more volume to play with if I really jam out to some good music. In the future I would like to try the JBL Extreme, even though I know it's not as portable as these other speakers I have.

R3B50FJN1UU9BC,3.0 out of 5 stars Audio Engineers point of view,Christo,3,"I purchased two of these to work as a stereo pair in my apartment to obtain a nice full sound without having to really crank the volume to have an enjoyable experience and bother the neighbors.Well it all started out great, the white look clean and are small enough to not take up too much visual space. They also sound fantastic for a battery powered speaker, relatively full low end and crisp highs without needing to be EQed. They are setup roughly 15’ feet from one another in opposing corners of my studio space. They add presence and a fullness that I was missing from my Notabrick Bluetooth speakers.Now for THE PROBLEMS:I synced the speakers together and switched them to “stereo” mode from the app with no problem using my iPhone 13 Pro running Bluetooth 5.1. When it was time to connect it to my stationary media hub it was intended for (a 2020 iPad 8th gen) it would only connect one speaker and not allow for a party link or stereo link between the two Charge 5’s anymore. It took my some time of testing and no help from the internet to find out that the Bluetooth 4.2 that the iPad uses means the JBLs could no longer connect in a pair. I figured they had their own connection protocol (perhaps wifi 2.4ghz) for party mode. This shared audio functionality will ONLY work if your device that is sending audio is Bluetooth 5.1.SECOND ISSUE:So I put the iPad aside and would only be using my iPhone for music since that’s the only way I could get the Stereo mode to function. But after 15-30 minutes of music playback the speakers will disconnect themselves from one another requiring you to manually go to them and reconnect themselves. Every third time or so they will also drop the Bluetooth connection requiring you to “forget device” on your phone and resync Bluetooth to your host Charge 5 and then relink the speakers.This is all to say that if you want to use more than one speaker, even using a compatible Bluetooth 5.1 device that they are extremely finicky. Using a single Charge 5 has proved to be very reliable, sound great and look great. I am an audiophile and have many thousands of dollars in pro audio.The current tested Firmware version is 0.8.6.0 and has not been updated for over a year so this is unlikely to be fixed.UPDATE: I purchased two Charge 4 speakers to run through all the same testing and scenarios as the newer Charge 5 Models and found that with the exception of the occasional dropout and auto reconnection (perhaps once every two hours or so) these have solved all my issues. In fact, having the Aux plug on this model has also meant I can plugin my DJ decks to them when we are at the park and the primary speaker that is being plugged into will duplicate the signal and send it to the second speaker wirelessly with no issues. There is about one second of lag with this setup so the use of my DJ headphones is a requirement, but I love the added functionality. I also find the battery meters to be much more easy to read on the Charge 4. Finally, I do not know if it's because the transmission power of the Bluetooth 4.2 in the Charge 4 over the Bluetooth 5.1 in the Charge 5, but I find that I get a longer transmission range with no dropouts with the older Charge 4 model. On paper this should be backwards but testing 4 independent units in different scenarios have shown this to be recurring findings for me. I have used the 2020 iPad, iPhone 13 pro and Macbook M1 pro and a HD Firestick as my test subjects.I do notice that the Charge 5 has a slight edge in real world testing for maximum volume and clearly has a crisper high end to it where the Charge 4 sounds a little more round but is still very pleasing to the ear. I suggest to save a ton of money and pickup the Charge 4 if you are planning on using them in a multi speaker setup like me.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023",True,22,Color: White,Bose

R1D9I181C4INKE,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little speakers,The pc builder,5,So let start off by I’m old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands… I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin’s- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I’d like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don’t overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I’m sure you’ll love too!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",True,3,Color: Black,Bose

I like music when I’m working so sound quality is important to me. I’d say skip the charge 5 get a more expensive model or save money get the flip 6 which is like the charge 5 or get good quality in this speaker bracket by getting the boom 2 for 100 bucks.

R3SNE4CFU8H98C,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing price point for B&O,Lowcountry harleyrider,5,"Needed another small, portable Bluetooth speaker to take along while traveling. Having used Bose Sound Link and similar speakers over the years, I noticed this B&O A1 2nd generation on sale and decided to purchase it based on my previous experiences with B&O. For roughly $200 US dollars on sale, I decided to purchase this speaker because of it’s relatively small footprint, having Amazon Alexa built in, and the sound quality (60 watts total power) of B&O. The design and build quality are what you’d expect from B&O. Beautiful brushed aluminum and a nifty little hand loop for carrying, the large donut-shaped speaker lies flat, while dispersing 360 degree stereo sound.After charging the battery to full, I quickly added the speaker via my iPhone’s Bluetooth settings and then upgraded the speaker software via the B&O app. You can easily change the sound output of the speaker through the customizable EQ settings via the app. Amazon Alexa is easily setup (via the Alexa app) and works like it’s supposed to. There are 3 microphones on the speaker and they function well. Sound is clear and bright. Soundstage is fairly wide for this little speaker and the volume gets plenty loud for my needs.Overall, I would recommend this product as an amazing value to anyone who wants a little BT speaker from B&O. It is water and dust proof (IP67 rated) and easily fits into a backpack or travel bag. In terms of durability, time will tell, but this thing is built like a tank, and weighs just one pound. I have not had any Bluetooth connectivity issues and the battery is rated to last 18 hours after a full charge (3 hours charging time via included USB-C cable). Any changes to the aforementioned specs and I’ll update this review. All in all, I’m happy with this purchase. If you like B&O, you can’t go wrong with a portable speaker at this price point.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2024",True,4,Color: Anthracite,Bang&Olufsen
R3AUXRX3JOHE81,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent - Perfect for minimal Mac setup,Donovan Dillon,5,"I purchased the B&O Beosound A1 2nd Gen to improve my MacBook Pro - based, 2 cable (1 monitor power cord, 1 USBC to drive the external monitor + power my MacBook Pro) work from home setup. My work area is limited and in the middle of my kitchen / living / dining area — so aesthetics are also a factor.I specifically wanted: (1) reliable, high quality audio for conferencing and music, (2) small footprint, (3) cable-free / wireless operation, and (4) long battery life.On paper, the B&O Beosound A1 seemed ideal; however after extensive research I felt like I would be paying a premium for the small form factor while compromising on sound quality (ref Alan Ross YouTube videos) and perhaps battery life. I decided to take the plunge as I could return the unit if it disappointed.The unit was delivered on time and I was very impressed with the packaging, instruction booklet, physical quality, and straightforward button layout. Setup and software update using the B&O iOS app was intuitive and almost effortless. Pairing the unit with my MacBook Pro and selecting the microphone and speaker in MacOS preferences was routine. The unit charged from 80% to 100% using my MacBook Pro USBC power adapter in about 2 hours. I immediately tested music playback and found it acceptable and inline with Alan Ross’s review (good highs and mids, less than robust bass, and sound quality highly sensitive to speaker placement / tweeter orientation). I also observed that the unit would power off after a period of inactivity and was concerned that I might have to reset the speaker and microphone connections after turning the unit back on. All in all these were potential complications I could live with.The unit passed its inaugural 1 hour Microsoft Teams meeting / video conference with flying colors the following day: powering it up reestablished wireless Bluetooth pairing, plus microphone and speaker assignments; and audio quality was reliable and exceptional throughout the meeting. This is the primary reason I purchased the unit, so I was ready to claim mission accomplished. However, a surprise was in store.After my conference call I decided to check battery level using the B&O app — the unit was at 95% after a few hours of experimenting with music playback, letting the unit sit overnight and a 1 hour conference call in the morning. That was reassuring, but while in the app my attention was drawn to the app’s Equalizer feature which I had glossed over during setup and did not examine during my prior musical exploration -- so I decided decompress to random selections from my Apple Music library while also testing the equalizer settings.Wow, I was blown away by the difference in sound quality using the equalizer — particularly the Ambient setting. I listened to selections from John Williams, Florence + the Machine, Acadia, Los Lonely Boys, Makaveli, Chick Corea, James Blake, Lydia Low, Ani DiFranco, Prince, Coldplay, Matisyahu, Public Enemy, Anthony and The Johnsons, Yael Naim and others. The range featured classical, R&B, rock, reggae, metal, alternative, singer songwriter, vocal, instrumental, a cappella — an excellent sample of what I listen to — and nothing disappointed: Sound clarity is excellent, highs are bright, mids are uniform and punchy, lows are deep and moving for a 5"" speaker, and volume is excellent for my use case (personal audio — not throwing a party).Net-net: It turns out that the Beosound A1 2nd Gen was a no compromises purchase for my requirements. The form factor perfectly matches my minimal Mac setup, the conferencing functionality is great and the sound quality is exceptional for my musical tastes. This product is of the best purchases I’ve made.","Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2020",True,108,Color: Anthracite,Bang&Olufsen

There is low end to be had and i think it is in perfect balance in contrast to some other speakers that were so bass forward as to be a bit boomy.The speaker is also very aesthetically pleasing, lightweight and easy to take with you for traveling.Bluetooth connectivity was quick, easy and 100% hassle free whereas some of the other top models out there had trouble connecting or random disconnects or dropouts.my only complaint - if i absolutely had to make one - would be that it does not come with any type of carrying or travel case.

R17V0MBO3O6UB3,1.0 out of 5 stars Not recommended,Demiurge,1,"Sound is decent for the size/portability. But after having this for several years, there are just too many short falls in comparison to my other travel size speakers.Battery life has dropped down to abyssal levels after intermo use over the last two years. Im talking, 3 hours at modest volume at most. I've never seen battery degradation like this, despite making sure I followed typical protocols for battery life during this time. It may have also been sub par to begin with in terms of battery life, but I find myself blown away with how quickly it dies nowadays.The app is horrible, and the Bluetooth connectivity is always a chore. Sometimes I will take me 15 min of switching the speaker on and off, Bluetooth on and off on the device, forgetting the device, re pairing, etc until I get it to work... Which always seems to be random. And it's not just my phone - my wife and kids phones have the same issue, whether using the B&O app or not. Ive never had a Bluetooth device act so poorly in my life. This alone is not worth the hassle.Build quality is great. Solidly built. Sounds decent but not exceptional for the price. I don't often review, but am surprised this has so many positive reviews, to be honest.

R38H6S9H6NZ0KC,"5.0 out of 5 stars Don't believe every review you read, especially negative ones.",CP,5,"Don't believe every review that you read...and only take isolated reported connectivity issues with a grain of salt, especially when they are incorrect. i.e. bluetooth 5.1 connectivity distance etc. Most connectivity issues in my 35 yrs of tech experience are due to ""user error"". Beyond that most can be, and are corrected with a firmware update. Now that being said, my opinion of course here on this unit follows. I have only had this 2nd generation Beosound A1 for a day, so keep that in mind. But right out of the box, this is the best sounding truly portable speakers that I have ever heard, period. Amazingly so, in fact that I have ordered a two more to fit an application that required exactly what these A1's offer. Beautiful clean sound that is loud enough in a large hockey puck style footprint the can be placed under a kitchen cabinets trim, virtually out of sight. How awesome it that? I had zero connectivity issues, and as a matter of fact I was surprised how well the connectivity worked with my iPhone, iPad, and 12"" MacBook. Just as you would expect from a Bluetooth 5.1 device! I cannot and will not comment on Alexa connectivity because if I wanted Alexa capability I would just fire up one of the useless Alexa units that I have in my closet. I can only suspect B&O added Alexa capability because they have some licensing deal with Amazon. As for battery usage I have only had it for a day. But if it comes close to the 18 hours as listed this is even more a winner. And of course this is really portable so you can just plug it as you do your phone to fully charge in 2.75 hours. As for the microphones to be used as a conferencing type device....pretty cool. Though I have not tested them. It will be a bonus if they work as well as the rest of this device's features. You have to keep in mind that if you want Alexa, Siri, Google, and tele-conferencing capabilities you ALWAYS have to purchase dedicated devices for those needs.. If you can get a device like the B&O A1 (2ND GEN) that is ""primarily"" a portable battery operated speaker that you can bring to the beach to be just decent at those other things then you are way ahead of the game.","Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2021",True,17,Color: Sport,Bang&Olufsen

R1GFKXWY2U1CG7,2.0 out of 5 stars Just get a different speaker for around this price bracket.,Louis Valencia,2,"I've been using this speaker since February and I've given it a very long chance, but I keep finding things to dislike about it.I tend to use this speaker at work after we close at my big retail store since there's enough space between me and my other coworkers for me to just enjoy my music and for them to have their own speakers blasting and enjoying their music. THEIR speakers sound better and are louder than this one whether it's a JBL, Tribit, Sony, or Bose speaker. I'll pass by and their music drowns mine. So before I get to specifics, tl;dr, everything I'm about to say is just going to call back to this: just get something else for this price bracket because this speaker will disappoint you.Battery life? This thing will last you roughly 3 hours at max volume. How do I know that? My store closes 5 hours into my shift and I'm using it for the last 3 hours of my shift and by the time I clock out it either already died or is about to die. It also takes an eternity to charge to full. You basically need to leave it overnight for it to charge so if I ever forget to charge the thing 3 hours before my shift, it's not going to charge to full. I had a JBL Clip 4 I got for 60 bucks that lasted longer than this and charged better. Other nitpick about charging this thing is the fact that it turns on automatically when you connect a charger to it and you have to wait a little more than 5 seconds to be able to turn it off. It's annoying.Sound? It sounds fine when it's right next to you. The quality and bass is real nice. But if you step more than 10 feet away from it or if you're at a specific angle away from this speaker, the quality just dips drastically. Like I said, the main thing I really care about it is how loud it is and every other speaker in the $100 bracket around me just outclasses this thing. This thing is in the $200 bracket. I'll step a few feet away from my speaker and barely hear it, but I'll definitely hear my coworkers' speaker from the next aisle over.How does it look? I've seen a lot of reviews saying, ""Oh wow this thing has some kick to it for how small it is!"" This thing is not small. They're lying. Those reviews will make you think it's as no bigger than a teacup plate. No, this thing is surprisingly big and bulky. It will not fit in most hoodie pockets. You cannot clip it to anything because it is also heavy. This thing literally looks like and is the size of a smoke detector.Bluetooth connectivity? Yeah it's pretty good. Very annoying though when I plug it in to charge and it automatically turns on and thus connects to my phone and starts playing sound through it. Like seriously, why is this a feature?Anyways, yeah. Get something else. This thing is not worth it.","Reviewed in the United States August 2, 2023",True,13,Color: Grey Mist,Bang&Olufsen

B&O offers an app to do that, but it was not recognized by the iOS meaning that iTunes music and other apps used the internal loudspeaker of the phone.

The B&O connects instantly and if you want to hear all your instruments as I do, don't get the Roam. The B&O gives me great pleasure to listen to. I would put the Bose Soundlink Mini II is my second favorite, and the Sonos third. The Sonos Roam, some like, but a muted sound compared to the full range B&O. The Beosound A1 Gen2 has perfect bass but not the thundering bass on the Roam. Some might like the Roam better, was very disappointed the muffled sound and connectivity.","Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2023",True,7,Color: Green,Bang&Olufsen
RKC0ZNFMT4BJ4,"2.0 out of 5 stars Snap, Crackle, Pop! Bad Bluetooth leads to ruined experience",Colin M. Shawhan,2,"Does not sync reliably and often drops leading to a crackling stutter. Seems this high end brand is pushing a product aimed at a utilitarian application and failing.The trouble started immediately on charging and powering the speakers on. Setup is temperamental. Okay, no sweat. But once set up the units constantly dropped Bluetooth signal causing a popping sound, disrupting the media, and toggling in and out of stereo mode. Stereo pairing was barely functional.Thinking this might be battery related, I purchased a 3x1 USB charger to try the units in an external powered state, which was markedly better. But the signal loss persisted, if less frequently.I decided to perform further testing: the laptop.The B&O performs as poorly with the laptop (2022 HP i7) as the Android with Bluetooth connectivity dropping approx. once per minute at less that 3ft of distance. My wife's $20 bluetooth speaker connected flawlessly under the same conditions, same day and weather. She's not an audiophile, but her speaker works.This would be functionally useless in a social setting and an absolute disaster in a professional setting, like a PowerPoint, where technical problems can kill a presentation. No can do!I am a professional and I demand reliability.As for sound it's pretty clean, but I fail to hear 2x $250 worth of WOW! I opted for Jazz but I also tinkered with Metal and Hip Hop. For Jazz it performed well enough. I would not recommend these speakers to fans of Rock, Rap or Country. Perhaps Classical? The bass is anemic, which is unsurprising for a 4"" driver. I wasn't expecting night club bass. Maybe they want me to shell out another $700 for a sub. Would it sync? Forget it.These speakers do not connect successfully enough to be useful for audio reproduction of any kind, let alone deserving of ""audiophile"" status. Imagine a fancy sports car that won't run. What will your hot date think of your broken down Ferrari, waiting for a tow truck on the side of the expressway? Not much. It simply doesn't work.Give me a Ford F-150 that runs, which is why I might consider something like Bose. I would say that's a fair comparison. B&O have their place but it is not your family barbecue. Maybe Bose or JBL isn't the top of the audiophile line, but if it syncs and plays it is 1000x better than this mess.Avoid.","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2023",True,2,Color: Anthracite,Bang&Olufsen

RUNGSE4G00QBH,5.0 out of 5 stars The right settings and location make a difference,Professional Courtesy,5,"So, I’ve been a Bose fan for three decades. For outdoor use I’ve owned the Bose Soundlink (2, actually). It has decent sound for a small unit, although the batteries have tended to die prematurely.I looked for a new option and ran across this B&O unit. I knew the company had a good reputation for quality audio, but had never owned any of their gear. When I initially purchased the A1, I thought, this is okay, but not better than my Bose that cost half as much. Then I began tinkering with the streaming music from my iPad. Two things: 1) On an iPad/iPhone go to Settings>Music>EQ and hit Rock. That brings out the highs and lows of this speaker. 2) Also, I think several weeks of use “loosened up” the speakers and allowed for an improved audio experience. I’m no audiophile, but it simply sounded better after some use.One tip: put the speaker about 1’ from a wall for maximum bass.The bottom line is, the speaker sounds fantastic, even at lower volumes. It is well built and feels substantial in your hand. I absolutely love it. In all fairness to Bose, I’ve not heard the Revolve II. It is far larger than the B&O, but is not nearly a sexy or portable.Spend the money. You won’t be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2022",True,2,Color: Sport,Bang&Olufsen
RNH3RU6JCMI9F,5.0 out of 5 stars Honest opinion,theRecipe,5,"Original review: After spending 6+ hours with this speaker one thing that I have noticed is that its a personal speaker. You can set it next to you at a lower volume, pump up the bass to a level you want through the companion app and get a full sound, all the while the person on the other end of the couch can barely hear it. Or you can turn it up for others to hear. I added a personal EQ setting that upped the bass so at lower volumes I could have a more full sound. From there as I increase the volume, I move to the “Ambient” setting and I guess if I cranked it loud enough I would move on to the “Optimal” setting. I think it just depends on how much bass you want.I ordered a second one to test the stereo sound on this. I’ve read some people had issues with this, so it might not work out. I’ll update this with my findings.Update 1: I found pairing 2 beoplay A1’s into stereo mode is easy. I had no issues with it. It does not sound any louder in stereo but it sounds good. You can also choose to set them up in mono mode and they sound much louder this way.Update 2: In the end I returned both speakers, I thought they sounded excellent but for $500.00 I could get more sound for less. I ended up with the UE Hyperboom. It’s stereo or mono, it sounds extremely good turned down low and excellent turned up from medium to high.","Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2021",True,6,Color: Anthracite,Bang&Olufsen

The sound for such a small speaker is endearing. Very smooth although a bit bass heavy. No treble screech when pushed…in fact, very little notable distortion when cranking it up with TI or Electric Six. A very enjoyable sound that can be listened to without ear fatigue.BUT…..it has one very annoying habit. When plugged in to charge, it immediately turns itself on and then connects to any active Bluetooth connection it can locate, many times disconnecting what’s already connected. No other wireless speaker I’ve used does this, incl Bose, JBL, Oonz, UE, etc. Darned annoying when I’m on my headphones and plug in the B&O to charge only to have it start blasting what was previously thru the cans.","Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2022",True,40,Color: Sport,Bang&Olufsen
R1DG7N4TGRMDCU,"3.0 out of 5 stars Decent sound, but....",Robert Last,3,"As expected from B&O, the sound quality is superb for the size of this speaker. I have two complaints, though: the Bluetooth interface is terrible. If, for example, you have the BT connection set to ""calls and audio"", Everytime you get an sms, the sound feed goes into pause mode. The speaker auto-connects to it's last paired device so, for example, if you have both a cell phone and a tablet that you use with the B&O device, you literally need to turn BT off on one (the previous) device to avoid the B&O device from doggedly trying to reconnect with the former device that it was paired with while you're in setup mode. Also, the Gen 2 A1 frequently loses it's Bluetooth connection which puts whatever you're using to stream into pause mode. Then you have to click on the app to continue when the A1 reconnects.I'm also not overly-enamored with the sound quality. It is good, but not great. And this BT-only speaker has a ""it has to sound great"" price tag. My biggest issue, though, is that B&O got rid of the feature that allowed the previous generation to connect via either wifi or BT. I really miss the ability to just connect it with wifi -- and I'm pretty sure the sound quality would be a lot better.These are not huge issues, but when we're talking about equipment from a high-end company like B&O, I expect complete transparency and perfect functionality. And this misses that mark from various standpoints.","Reviewed in the United States October 8, 2021",True,4,Color: Grey Mist,Bang&Olufsen

Nothing compares to the price and quality of this product. Top of its class.","Reviewed in the United States November 16, 2022",True,16,Color: Anthracite,Bang&Olufsen

In my opinion, it’s the best speaker I have ever hear in this size class. Get the app, set it up and enjoy. The battery will last you days. I really cannot say enough good things about this speaker.

R3PDX409HMFZ0H,5.0 out of 5 stars Stunning deep green speaker with equally stunning sound-worth every penny!,Jennifer Gill,5,"I love the B & O app, the customer service agent was fantastic to help me with set up, and the sound quality of this powerhouse of a little speaker brings me much joy.I also purchased earbuds from B & O in the same green and was blown away by the quality of both of these. I cannot over state the quality of the aesthetics on this company's designs. The quality is just what I want and expected and this speaker brings opulence to my environment every day in appearance, functionality and sound quality!The only thing I wish is that I could use this as a Google Voice Assistant instead of Alexa speaker. My Bose home speaker is quite pricey and sounds fantastic as well, though it is wired, and has Google Assistant options on it. Why, B & O, can't you allow us to have Google Voice Assistant on these?

R8MIVAQ6HUKZO,1.0 out of 5 stars Don't Believe The Hype,Citizen Avenger,1,"So, this is one of the worst blue tooth speakers I've ever heard. You read that right. I don't understand the positive reviews at all.Before I get to the sound, out of the box it would not connect to my MacBook. I was never able to make that happen. I was able to get it to connect to my phone, but all of the buttons - power, bluetooth, etc. - are tiny and don't respond in any real tactile way. They are very hard to press down and there's no way to adjust the volume unless you pick it up. I would say they went with form over function, but it doesn't even look as cool as the photos. It just looks weird.The sound has more in common with a cheap transistor radio than anything near a legitimate speaker. I had the Sony XE300 and it blows this speaker out of the water. From Public Enemy to Coltrane, the B&O sounds tinny, muddy and ultra compressed.Also, if you set it on a table and you happen to be sitting at that table, the sound is even worse. You have to be significantly above it, or place it so it's pointing directly at you, which is pretty much impossible due to its shape. I guess you could hang it from the ceiling.I'm no audiophile, but I'm a musician and have mixed albums. It's no understatement to say either this speaker is defective or it's an over-priced piece of junk riding off the B&O name.","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2023",True,2,Color: Grey Mist,Bang&Olufsen
R2UTWNRGGAS8JZ,5.0 out of 5 stars It ain't cheap but it's good,gameshoes,5,"For its size, the sound quality is great. I do have some songs that it just doesn't handle all that well though. Battery life is amazing. I use it at work for about 6.5 hours (at about 40% volume), then about an 1.5 hours more at home (at about 30% volume), and only need to recharge it once a week. Yes, turning up the volume will require more power. But, if you just like adding ambiance, keeping it below half volume gives great endurance.Bluetooth delay greatly depends on the app being used. For most video streaming purposes, the lag was minimal to where it wasn't a distraction. Games were a few seconds behind which makes this not a good experience.Using the speaker for phone calls worked well.Since I use it daily, it has quite a few dings. At work, I tie it around my belt so it does get hit once in a while. The scuffs really do show, and not gracefully contrary to the advertising.Price may be a pain point for some buyers.","Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2020",True,21,Color: Grey Mist,Bang&Olufsen
R3JD0V1T9RNVW8,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Out There now,The Quain,5,"I went through all the JBL models before finding this. This is far superior in sound quality. Bass is easy for any speaker manufacturer to offer. Treble and midrange are much more difficult and expensive to get right. B&O offers a fuller range of music than anything JBL has to offer. The younger generations are being duped into thinking bass is the main feature. Again, that's easier and cheaper to get right. Even so, two of the JBL units we tried mushed out the bass at higher volumes. Not this unit. This is currently the best unit in its price range, by far.","Reviewed in the United States September 8, 2022",True,5,Color: Grey Mist,Bang&Olufsen

I thought the bass could have been better for a 5.25” speaker — it does help to put it in the corner of a room. It looks and feels (to the touch) like a premium product with high quality materials. The last straw for me was that it shorted out after being splashed a few times — not submerged, not soaked, just splashed — and did not live up to its water resistant promise or the poolside photos in the ads.

It is expensive, no doubt, but as one reviewer said before me this is simply the best sounding speaker in it's class. We went with the Grey Mist color that not only accentuates the design but makes the controls on the side very easy to see and operate, which I know was a criticism from others who ordered the darker color.

R3NI3I1VAB4EB0,3.0 out of 5 stars Unusable for video-conferencing,racter,3,"I chose this bluetooth speaker because of its microphone and conferencing capabilities. The microphone quality is awful - grainy, far-away, and distant, and I've gotten complaints from every person I've tried to call on this thing. Furthermore, it has a ""speakerphone mode"" which degrades both input and output quality of the device, and you can't switch it off if you're using the microphone, ie. you can't use this speaker to play high-quality audio while you use a different microphone.The audio quality is good but pairing it with the MacBook Pro which has no system-level equaliser out the box and no B&O app, it's annoyingly bassy when I don't want it to be. It shuts off automatically after a period of time which means I have to re-pair it with my MacBook every now and again if I'm not listening to something continuously, and the Bluetooth pairing isn't alway successful.Overall, nice music-playing speaker.

The sound is fine but at its loudest, is probably just enough to hear from another room and be okay. But my main problem is that it vibrated off my bathroom sink twice and fell to the floor. My Bose speaker never had done this so it was surprising though you’d think I would have learned after the first time. I thought perhaps I had placed it precariously and then it fell after the vibrations moved it. But no, even though the bottom FEELS like it’ll keep it stationary, it doesn’t, so I have to hang it from its rope on my doorknob.I want to love it more than I do. I’d return it but since it fell twice there are now slight dents along the speaker perimeter so I don’t believe it’s returnable.On the plus side, it looks nice.","Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2021",True,2,Color: Anthracite,Bang&Olufsen

I generally lean for a more bass-forward sound, and it accomplishes this without sounding muddy. In this regard it is one of the best bluetooth speakers for room-filling deep bass. The major limitation is in its bluetooth connectivity. It has bluetooth 4.2 which is outdated. It can only be actively connected to 1 device at a time reliably, and has a tough time switching between input sources (phone vs computer). Moreover there is very noticeable AUDIO LAG, which kills me when watching a youtube video casually.

RARAXCB1JMO2X,Sound quality is so-so,Mr Bruh,3,"Having used the Go+ Play 2 (which i love) for a while now, i thought of looking at other speakers from this company. What grabbed my attention was honestly the price; for what I paid, it seemed like a steal.About a week later i received the Oynx Studio 7, and my impressions upon first listening to it were, wow it's bass is way too overpowering. Furthermore, there are no adjustments that can be made to the bass from the speaker itself, nor is there an accompanying app to make adjustments, unlike with JBL (owned by Harman - Harman Kardon) or Audio Pro. As a result you are left with a product that isn't faithfully representing what the artist at all intended, because the bass is far too dominant regardless of the track you're playing.The bass is loose and not taut as i, or any audio enthusiast, would like; It means that songs which might have a more drum like kick to them, end up sounding as if you've dialled the PC cinema subwoofer to the max, thereby overpowering everything and sounding unnatural.I also find the treble not to be shimmery enough for my liking, but again that is something the Go+ Play 2 excels in. It's not an open enough soundstage.For the record, i've owned the Studio 5 before, and despite the concerns around it's rechargeable battery depleting too quickly and not being replaceable, it sounded much better. The bass was deep, but not overpowering; it sounded organised and not unhinged...which is unfortunately what it feels like with the Studio 7. The studio 8 is no better, other than the fact it has water resistance, which is kinda cool.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom December 4, 2023",True,1,,harman kardon

It just requires testing various equalizers from GooglePlay. I found the right one and this things jams severely. With volume at half it is loud as hell and has brilliant clarity and bass response. I bought the Evo Crusher headphones back in November and they are the best I've ever heard. Skullcandy has delivered some great products for the price. I paid over $300 for the JBL Extreme 3 a few years ago and still love it but it is no better than the Skullcandy Barrel. Just take the time to find a good EQ.

Now this one held a charge for two hours at lower volumes then died. Fully charged it several times with same results. Side by side with my Tribit SBB, with the same exact song tracks, Tribit had more bass. The extra base option on the Barrel XT just distorts alot of the bass. If you have these two speakers, try ""baby got back"" by SMalot between the two. Skullcandy - no bass; Tribit - nice deep, boomy bass how I know the song should sound. Yet, I love the headphones (Crusher Evo) - these have amazing bass and sound. Can you tell I like bass ? I'd skip this speaker. I gave it one star because it looks really cool.

Now for the speaker itself-beautiful design with basic controls and no clutter, under the handle you find the control buttons. Simple layout, power on/off, volume controls- we all know how they work, volume up and volume down. Bluetooth pairing button and lightshow button-more on this latter. Controls can skip to next track, back up to last track played and turn lightshow on and off. Has a host of other functions at your fingertips like transmitting-can send signal to other speakers, true stereo-which as name suggests can split signal into left or right channel and when combined with a additional speaker delivers true split channel stereo sound. Speaker is touted as being waterproof, but at this price someone else can test that claim out…lol. To many other functions to go into here so make sure to review included quick start guide. Has internal rechargable Lit-ion batteries and included charging brick and cable. Now for the part you have been waiting for, how does it sound? Brilliant, no other word can describe it. The reproduction of the tracks I jammed were clean, clear with rich treble and bass. Actually caught myself noticing fills and backing tracks that stood out front and center that I never picked up on before, or payed attention to. Crystal clear reproduction with no distortion even at generous volumes. Besides Bluetooth input it also accepts normal aux inputs, and as I said earlier a lightshow if your into that sort of thing. Nothing big and gaudy, a thin strip in front of unit below handle of LED’s that are multicolored and blend in nicely with the aesthetics of the unit. Last thoughts on this speaker-Pricey, well yeah, but you get what you pay. Other then my sound system for my guitars with the thousand dollar amps I haven’t come across anything else that is as rich and clear as this system, different frequencies punch through cleanly without distortion. Sound- read prior response…lol…is it worth it? All depends on the individual, I’ve some friends that think two tomcats howling in the moonlit back alley sounds good- they probably won’t appreciate the sound quality. But for those audiophiles among us out there, you might of just found Nirvana….not the band, the experience while listening to them…..so yeah get this one and throw away or donate your others to a good home, you will thank me. And oh yeah…it gets pretty darn loud..","Reviewed in the United States October 17, 2023",False,7,Color: Black,skullcandy

R3ISECZZ0QRV6E,4.0 out of 5 stars Big boombox will rock your skull,Dale  B.,4,"Skullcandy's Barrel Bluetooth speaker is impressively large with a funky style. With a big rubbery monopod base the Skdy Barrel looks a lot likeJBL's boombox, but way more affordable. The sound is well balanced and powerful with good thump from those big orange bass resonators on the sides. There are lights that respond to the music integrated into the body of the speaker.The speaker has a large capacity battery built in. I played it for ten hours at medium volume and still had two bars left on the charge lights.For portability the package includes a heavy-duty removable strap besides the handle on the speaker.You also get a charging brick, Aux cable, instructions and Skullcandy sticker pack in a big box.One thing I don't like is the flap covering the input ports. It's hinged so tight that it pushes the charge cable up pretty hard. Same issue using a USB drive, the flap will squeeze it.Other than that, the Skullcandy Barrel speaker is a definite player in the big boombox category. It's reasonably priced compared to the big-name brands with a funky style that's hard to ignore and powerful sound to go.","Reviewed in the United States November 19, 2023",False,3,Color: Black,skullcandy
RWHJE0DM2KYRJ,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Bluetooth Speaker All Around!,Realm of Nova,5,"The media could not be loaded. Skullcandy thought of everything when it comes to this Bluetooth speaker, as it has everything you could ask for; excellent sound quality, durable construction, vibrant RGB lighting, passthrough charging, multipoint connection, and much more.To start, this Speaker is MASSIVE. I was honestly shocked at the size of it when I first opened it, and it is quite heavy too. Heavy enough that you can use it as a dumbbell. The speaker comes with a small power brick with a barrel plug for charging, along with a carrying strap, stickers, and the quick start guide. The speaker immediately went into pairing mode when I first powered it on, and I was able to connect it over Bluetooth in less than a minute.As soon as I played some music though it for the first time, my jaw dropped. Even at 40-50% volume this speaker will shake my living room and be a nuisance to my neighbors. The audio that plays out of this speaker is shockingly clear and detailed, despite also having rich and punchy bass. Even at max volume, the audio refuses to distort and the sound stage stays intact. Voices in songs are crisp without being sharp, and even high end instruments still shine despite the low end bass wanting to claim the spotlight. For my video demo, I used some copyright free tracks, but trust me, play any song you want through this, and it will blow you away. What makes it even more surprising, is that this is my opinion before even mentioning bass boost, which takes what you love about the audio already and makes it even punchier. You can switch bass boost on and off by holding down the play button until it glows.Plus, if that isn't enough, the speaker also has a front RGB light strip that you can adjust to your preference between a few static themes and a few ""react"" themes that will act as a visualizer when playing audio. There is also a plus and minus button for adjusting volume that will also act as a ""previous/next track"" button if you long press them.And we are still not done. This speaker also has passthrough charging, to where you can plug in any device into either the full sized USB type A or Type C port to charge while you are listening to the music. The built-in battery takes a couple hours to charge, but it does last well over several hours even when using it at higher volumes and charging other devices. There is also a AUX 3.5mm port for wired-in audio output if you don't want to use it over Bluetooth.However, the most interesting feature about this speaker is that while it does support multipoint connection and you can play audio from multiple connected devices, I think the Multi-Link connection to up to 99 other Skullcandy speakers is wild. I honestly really want to test that capability as not only is this single speaker on its own good enough to take to a party, I can only imagine how incredible having all 99 devices playing at the same time would be.Overall, there is not a single issue or complaint that I have or can find about this Bluetooth speaker. It has phenomenal audio with an incredible design that is sure to impress most people. I have even listened to more costly speakers than this one that don't sound nearly as good as what the Barrel can accomplish. I highly recommend it!","Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2023",False,20,Color: Black,skullcandy
R2PRV3AOSRHA6L,5.0 out of 5 stars Party Box: A Skullcandy Barrel Bluetooth Boombox Speaker Review,LT Beasimer,5,"The Skullcandy Barrel Bluetooth boombox speaker, made in China, includes the barrel speaker, a ten-foot charging adapter, a carry strap, and a user manual. When this speaker arrived, I removed it from the box and charged the battery. Once fully charged, I connected the speaker to my iPad and played music.The speaker is shaped like a 1980s boombox and can be carried by the handle or the shoulder strap. The strap is unnecessary at home but frees the hands for other purposes. Unfortunately, there isn’t internal storage for the strap on the speaker. The speaker is IPX5 water resistant, so I can use the speaker poolside without worry.A light button above the light strip cycles through interactive sound patterns or turns the light off. This strip also shows the volume level when altering the volume. The button panel has typical buttons that control basic functions. However, some features, like pairing a second speaker for stereo sound, are activated by programmed button patterns. Four battery-level indicator LEDs are located just above the control buttons.The audio is crisp and clear, even at the maximum volume setting. I can blast the music at one end of the house and hear it clearly at the other end. This speaker can keep the party energy high wherever you are. The 12-hour battery life is based on using the speaker at 50%, and the battery life is reduced at full volume.The Skullcandy Barrel Bluetooth boombox speaker is ready to go everywhere you go and sounds great. If this is the kind of speaker you want, this is the speaker for you.► PROS: 😊12-hour battery lifeIPX5 water resistanceBluetooth v5.3True wireless stereo – pairing a second Barrel speaker► CONS: 😞No internal strap storage","Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2023",False,3,Color: Black,skullcandy
R2TF27WK4NH9KA,5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive Sound and Portability,Lenny Jensen,5,"I recently purchased the Skullcandy Barrel™ Wireless Speaker (Model: 2SKSK1849) and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.First and foremost, the sound quality is outstanding. With a maximum output power of 60 Watts, this speaker delivers clear and powerful audio. The bass is deep, the mids are crisp, and the highs are sharp, creating an immersive listening experience.The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless, allowing me to effortlessly connect my smartphone and tablet. It also offers USB and wireless options for versatile connectivity. Plus, the 12-hour battery life is perfect for extended listening sessions, and the 4400mAh battery ensures it lasts.One of the standout features for me is its portability. The freestanding design is stylish, and the unit’s dimensions make it easy to carry around. It’s perfect for outdoor gatherings and adventures. Plus, the waterproof feature adds an extra layer of durability, making it suitable for various environments.The control buttons are intuitive and responsive, allowing you to adjust volume and playback with ease. I appreciate the inclusion of a 10FT AC adapter for convenient charging.While the speaker is relatively compact, it packs a punch with a maximum range of 92dB. It’s great for parties, picnics, or simply enjoying music at home.Although it’s not fully submersible, the water-resistant feature gives me peace of mind when using it outdoors, even in unpredictable weather.In summary, the Skullcandy Barrel™ Wireless Speaker is a fantastic addition to any audio setup. It’s powerful, portable, and built to withstand the elements. If you’re looking for a versatile outdoor speaker with excellent sound quality, this is the one to go for. Highly recommended! 👍🎶🔊","Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2023",False,5,Color: Black,skullcandy
RMDGTPMJCKEBX,5.0 out of 5 stars Extremely nice speaker!,Matthew,5,"I was looking for something to replace the old speaker in my garage. I came across this and will, this is a heck of a lot better than what I have! The LED lightshow is cool, but not really something I use often. The light does show you the volume when you change it though. It connects quickly and easily and doesn't drop the connection randomly. It also has an aux input. It's water resistant which I can confirm from it being in the backyard during our waterballon/watergun, sprinkler fun! The plugs are on the back covered by a large rubber plug. Of note is that you can charge other devices from this as well!The sound is quite good. The highs aren't overbearing, the midrange and low end are very good as well. Not muddy or overbearing. The strap is connected but rarely used. I can see where it would be great if carrying it to the beach/pool party, etc. Impressive speaker!","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023",False,0,Color: Black,skullcandy
R1UKJ0FURXGLTW,"5.0 out of 5 stars Nice speaker, a little heavy",dachiri,5,"Got this to finalize an outdoor movie area. Works great for that, plus music otherwise. Really nice that it's splash proof in case we bust out the squirt guns or kiddie pool, or a kid forgets to grab it when running away from a sudden rain.I...kind of question portable, personally. It's REALLY heavy! Given the volume potential, lights, and long battery life, I suppose the battery had to be kind of big, but I was definitely expecting something lighter and more compact when I ordered. I'm not knocking a start for that because for our purposes it only needs to be moved a few feet in and out, just an FYI if you think you're going to take this a bunch of places!","Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2023",False,0,Color: Black,skullcandy
R3LS4VD2W16PB7,5.0 out of 5 stars This thing THUMPS!,John Steenland,5,"Alright, first off this thing is huge. You know the giant boom boxes from the 80's? Yeah, very reminiscent of that (but instead, with a shoulder strap and no D-cell batteries required). I needed a new bluetooth speaker for my home gym and boy this is great. Read the quick-start because some of the buttons are a little different, press and hold for 2sec to turn on, press and hold play for 2sec to turn on bass boost etc... but realistically, it makes sense. It has a charger like a laptop, it needs some serious juice to power that 12hour battery. For its size, its not particularly heavy either, very manageable. Even has USB-C charging on the back so you can plug your phone into it while you rock the jams. Really impressed with the overall sound quality, you don't get the overpowering bass distortion - even at max volume, its very balanced and has a good crisp sound to it. Bass boost on sounds even better for me, but again - not to the point that its overpowering. Would be great for tailgating, beach, bonfires etc. as well since its water resistant and even has a rubber cover for the power outlets in the back. Very impressive. Especially for the price.","Reviewed in the United States October 20, 2023",False,1,Color: Black,skullcandy
R2WCOOH63X6JTI,5.0 out of 5 stars AMAZING sound,Impickle,5,"Over the summer I was using a different Bluetooth speaker at the beach and when we would stay out there for most of the day, the battery would inevitably die at some point which is frustrating - I love having music out there. When I saw that this speaker is water-resistant and has a 12-hour battery charge, I decided to order it, and man I'm so glad I did. I was taken aback a little when I first opened it because it's heavy (to me it is, probably not for everyone) and bigger than I expected. I thought ""Hmmm I'm not sure about hauling this thing down to the beach"". But as soon as I tried out the sound, that all went out the window. It has an incredible sound. No exaggerating. It's awesome! And the lights are cool, too... which seems funny to say as a middle-aged woman but they are! : ) It will get plenty of use!","Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2023",False,0,Color: Black,skullcandy
R3IFFNY5GLXDZX,5.0 out of 5 stars Really impressed,AVR,5,"Right away, I was impressed with the build on this speaker. It's heavy. It comes with a strap you can hook on for carrying, but I'll probably only use the handle as I won't be carrying it much. It's a solid, heavy build and seems to be good quality.It arrived halfway charged, so I was able to try it out right away without plugging it in. It's got indicator lights to show how much charge is remaining. It automatically went into pairing mode and was really easy to pair.The sound quality is great. It's definitely one of my best sounding speakers. If you hold down the play button for a couple seconds, bass boost turns on. It sounds really great with the extra bass. The sound is crystal clear and nice and full. It also gets really loud.The lights are cute, and there's a button to cycle through the different light modes or to turn them off.I will use this speaker a lot due to its portability. My other nice speakers are plugged in and stay put. With this one, I can be listening in one room, and then if I need to go work in another room, I can just pick it up and take it with me. That's really nice. I'm really impressed with the sound quality for a portable unit.","Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2023",False,0,Color: Black,skullcandy
