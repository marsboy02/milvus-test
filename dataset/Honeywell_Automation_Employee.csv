As per corporate law the Auditor and the approval Manager should also be terminated but there will be no action on them. Recommend not to choose Such a ""LALA Organization"".

This may be considered as Pro by those who do not want to work and do only politics. But this is a very serious Con for those who want to work hard with no corruption and grow. Due to difficult removal processes, a diploma technician joining Honeywell as Site engineer can reach to India level manager within 20 Yrs of his career irrespective of his abilities to understand the profile requirements or not. And he starts managing highly qualified MBAs and engineers joining lately. Irony is that, he only wants these skilled managers to behave with he intellect of diploma technician only as they can't understand anything beyond this.
All old timers are only engaged in settling one or the other vendor of their choice in company and obtain unethical benefits in return. Due to long time bonding of old timers, politics has gone into deeper routes and new entrants are forced to either get amalgamated into the muck or they are harassed so badly that they leave early. Many policies are existing in the company to stop this but the people responsible to ensure that these are followed are also old timers and the policies are left out just as an eyewash. 
Overall the company has tried to set in a very good culture but as true Indians, some of us have spoiled the atmosphere badly. The only solution is to ensure easy removal of high profile managers if they can't meet the requirements laid at policies.
Difficult removal is also blocking Career Growth of hard working employees as people on top are not leaving/ removed. Lesser vacancies created on top providing any growth opportunity to new comers.
Work Life balance at senior levels might (Repeat) might be comfortable but it is certainly not comfortable for lower level managers.  
Salaries are on lower side due to brand value affixed to the job....Read More"
