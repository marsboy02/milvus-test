0,0,"✅ Trip Verified |  Recently my daughter and I flew to Shanghai from Toronto on Air Canada. When we arrived in Shanghai, there was a problem with my daughter's visa and we were sent back to Toronto. It was such a difficult thing for us! Painful! But the staff on both the flight from Shanghai to Seoul and then from Seoul to Shanghai were unbelievably kind and thoughtful. They immediately offered words of encouragement, a listening ear, and comfort. I was so impressed at how a little kindness (a lot of kindness, in this case) can make such a difference when one is in distress! Either your teams are well-trained for situations like this, or they are just intuitive. I don't know. But hats off to Don and his crew! I wish I knew all of your names! We will certainly remember Air Canada and choose you again!",Air Canada,"✅ trip verified | recently my daughter and i flew to shanghai from toronto on air canada. when we arrived in shanghai, there was a problem with my daughter's visa and we were sent back to toronto. it was such a difficult thing for us! painful! but the staff on both the flight from shanghai to seoul and then from seoul to shanghai were unbelievably kind and thoughtful. they immediately offered words of encouragement, a listening ear, and comfort. i was so impressed at how a little kindness (a lot of kindness, in this case) can make such a difference when one is in distress! either your teams are well-trained for situations like this, or they are just intuitive. i don't know. but hats off to don and his crew! i wish i knew all of your names! we will certainly remember air canada and choose you again!", Trip Verified |  Recently my daughter and I flew to Shanghai from Toronto on Air Canada When we arrived in Shanghai there was a problem with my daughters visa and we were sent back to Toronto It was such a difficult thing for us Painful But the staff on both the flight from Shanghai to Seoul and then from Seoul to Shanghai were unbelievably kind and thoughtful They immediately offered words of encouragement a listening ear and comfort I was so impressed at how a little kindness a lot of kindness in this case can make such a difference when one is in distress Either your teams are welltrained for situations like this or they are just intuitive I dont know But hats off to Don and his crew I wish I knew all of your names We will certainly remember Air Canada and choose you again, Trip Verified |  Recently my daughter and I flew to Shanghai from Toronto on Air Canada When we arrived in Shanghai there was a problem with my daughters visa and we were sent back to Toronto It was such a difficult thing for us Painful But the staff on both the flight from Shanghai to Seoul and then from Seoul to Shanghai were unbelievably kind and thoughtful They immediately offered words of encouragement a listening ear and comfort I was so impressed at how a little kindness a lot of kindness in this case can make such a difference when one is in distress Either your teams are welltrained for situations like this or they are just intuitive I dont know But hats off to Don and his crew I wish I knew all of your names We will certainly remember Air Canada and choose you again,Trip Verified | Recently daughter I flew Shanghai Toronto Air Canada When arrived Shanghai problem daughters visa sent back Toronto It difficult thing us Painful But staff flight Shanghai Seoul Seoul Shanghai unbelievably kind thoughtful They immediately offered words encouragement listening ear comfort I impressed little kindness lot kindness case make difference one distress Either teams welltrained situations like intuitive I dont know But hats Don crew I wish I knew names We certainly remember Air Canada choose

The seats in the business section were almost empty and the staff had no power to act, all they tell you is company policy. I asked to pay for the upgrade, or to accommodate myself with an upgrade because my mother is an elderly person and she does not speak the language.

22,22,"✅ Trip Verified | The seats were comfy, the staff were nice, the airplane of decent quality, the entertainment system was brilliant and so on. However, where it all goes wrong is the policies of Air Canada. Under no circumstances will they provide you with anything more than a glass of water on your journey. Its a 4 hour journey, how about some chips or crackers?  Want to experience their brilliant entertainment system? Better purchase some headphones at a ridiculous price.

23,23,"✅ Trip Verified | Montreal to Los Angeles. Air Canada always go the extra mile to make your life miserable as a passenger. One example, when I have a 6:30 layover in Montréal while the airport is empty and most businesses closed I am unable to pay for lounge access, I am told you need to book ahead. Of course, I never seen any mentions of that before and no other airline do this kind of thing. I could see their lounge is mostly empty. They absolutely don't care about the passengers. If the company was not practically a monopoly and continually sponsored by my taxes and those of all Canadians, I wouldn't be so angry about it.

I was told that my baggage would be delivered at my address the following day, but it still has not been delivered. I spent one hour trying to contact a Representative on the phone to know if my baggage was on route (at 9.30pm) or at least if they could give me an idea of when I should expect it.

32,32,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst flight experience of my life. I had to switch my flight to a connecting flight which was delayed. The airline automatically rebooked my connecting flight because they were unable to transfer my bags in time, even though we made it to our gate with an hour to spare.

35,35,"✅ Trip Verified |  I brought some collapsible hiking poles in my carry-on luggage from Washington DC through Toronto to Calgary on my outbound trip, and then from Calgary to Toronto on my return trip, with no issues from security. But then during a separate pre-US arrival security screening from Toronto to Washington DC, I was told by security that I could not travel with them in my carry-on luggage and my only choices were to abandon them or try to speak to an Air Canada representative to put them in an additional checked bag. After deciding on the latter because of the value of the items, the Air Canada rep I spoke to, went out of his way to shepherd my sister and I all the way out through customs and back in again through security, getting us to the front of the line when he could and when it was appropriate, so that we could make our connecting flight on time. I have never experienced such good customer service with an airline like that before (despite the original issue with my carry-on item).

36,36,"✅ Trip Verified |  When everything goes smoothly, Air Canada is a good airline to fly with. The major problem with them is experiencing how they handle unexpected issues along the way. We were bumped off our flight from Vancouver to Tokyo because we wouldn't make our connection there and at the time, Japan didn't allow stay-overs in the country bacause of strict Covid restrictions. The way the passengers affected were treated from the time we got off the aircraft to the time we were re-booked on another flight the following day was horrible. They have good customer-facing people who are doing their best to deal with such situations, but as a major organization, their leadership never gives them the tools or budget to deal with it appropriately. They need to make major improvements in dealing with crisis situations as they occur. Increased authority at a mid-level management would certainly be a good first step. The managers appear to be doing their best to accomodate the stressful transitioning of customers throughout the airport, but they clearly lack discretionary budgets to keep customers comfortable during the process. No food, drink or emergency staff increases to deal with any of it. Every customer is treated like cattle, running through the loops on their own, not knowing where to go in the terminal to address the next steps, etc. I am rating Air Canada on a corporate level, not on an individual customer-facing staff level.",Air Canada,"✅ trip verified | when everything goes smoothly, air canada is a good airline to fly with. the major problem with them is experiencing how

50,50,"✅ Trip Verified | I am a fairly frequent solo traveler (3-5 flights per year at a minimum) and this was the most disgusting experience I have had with an airline from the cancelation 7 hours before my flight in the middle of the night to the 24 hours delayed arrival to my destination. I had a flight booked for Sunday, August 29th, 2021 scheduled to depart at 7.00 am. I was in town for a wedding and this flight was a one-way direct flight from Halifax, NS to Toronto, ON. At 11.00 pm I received an email from the airline notifying me my flight was canceled ""Due to weather"". I called Air Canada to rebook my flight and after waiting on hold for 2 hours I got through to an agent who would only rebook my flight if I paid an additional fare. He advised me if I wanted another flight for the next day I could get on an 11.00 am flight for an additional $600 or a 7.00 pm flight for an additional $300. This is in addition to the $400 I paid for the initial flight. After much back and forth I requested a supervisor at which point he transfers me through, the supervisor introduces himself, and as I begin speaking he proceeds to hang up on me. I was infuriated as it was late at night and I had nowhere to go and no flight for the next morning. The next day, I call the airline back in the morning (attempting to get someone who would put me on the 11.00 am flight without charging double the amount of the original ticket). I was transferred several times, and on the phone for a total of 5 hours before securing a flight that evening at 7.00 pm and was required to pay the amount of the original flight and they said they would refund the initial ticket (total paid before a refund is not $800 for the flight that was $400 when purchased 2 months before the flight). However, my flight was now scheduled to go to Newfoundland overnight and then in the morning depart to Montreal then Toronto for my final destination. The agent on the phone advised me that when I arrived in NFLD they would be able to help with the hotel situation. I ended up having to pay for the hotel out of pocket ($150 for the hotel + the $800 for the flight = $950 trip so far) when I arrived at the airport because the agents had no idea what I was talking about. Finally, the next morning at 9 am (26 hours after my regional flight and $950 dollars later) I arrive in Toronto. When I get here, not surprisingly, my bags did not make it. They were delivered to my location a day and a half later. I wanted to leave this review to share my experience with Air Canada. I was truly disgusted with the service from the airline, the fact that it is incredibly challenging to speak to anyone, the fact that Air Canada treats its clients as numbers, and the fact that this conglomerate is a company solely focused on making money and has little care about the people affected on their flights.

51,51,"✅ Trip Verified |  An early morning departure from Penticton, BC, check in staff very good and checked in quickly. Flight good and onboard staff pleasant, short flight so not much service offered or expected. The Q400 was an all economy flight but seated in row 2. Vancouver layover good, the lounge not back to pre-covid offerings yet, staff pleasant. Flight from Vancouver on the 787 Signature Class, the boarding was a bit delayed with no explanations given, boarding ok. Service onboard very good and the breakfast done very well and no complaints. Staff efficient. IFE worked well, pleanty of choice for the length of flight. Seat comfortable. As it was a daytime flight I did not use the flat bed but bedding was provided.

57,57,"✅ Trip Verified | Flying with Air Canada can be best described as slightly above-average. Not at all great, but most certainly not bad. The check-in agent in Portland who reviewed my flight and pandemic paperwork (to satisfy Canada's requirements) was very serious but also pleasant and helpful. The departure gate was relatively new, as well as secluded and quiet. The Portland gate agent was also courteous. The flight attendants were very serious and not much into pleasantries, but still pleasant when I needed to interact with them. The plane was a bit old, could have been slightly cleaner, but wasn't like a pigsty. The ticket was also a bit pricey considering that this was basically a 1-hour regional flight on a commuter jet (then again, I guess having to pay federal fees to the US and Canada for this flight might explain the price).

63,63,"Not Verified |  With over 15 years of travel experience I can definitely say this was the worst I experience. I have not flown on Air Canada for a while and will not be doing so in the near future. This was horrible from the clerk at the baggage drop-off to the boarding hostesses - rude and complete incompetence. It first started at the Air Canada luggage drop off point. The clerk pointed out that my carry-on was too big and requested I paid 115$ for the extra bag. So, I transferred everything to a small bag I had inside and to my other bags. When she weighed everything, one bag was 21 kg and the other 25 (2 kgs over the limit). She requested I remove the extra 2 kg or pay 100 $. I managed to remove the extra weight which she accepted. To my surprise at the gate, the hostess flags my boarding pass during boarding literally calling me a thief because I failed to pay the overweight and oversize fee. I was shocked, I tried to explain that this was an error and there is no way I made it through the security without paying. The hostess flat out told me I was lying and that there was no way for them to know I was telling the truth. They made me wait until all passengers boarded then a supervisor came and confirmed that I was telling the truth and that the clerk made a mistake. I was finally allowed to board. Please note: no apologies were offered for the inconvenience. As I was walking to the airplane to board, I started to experience some cramps in my hips since I was standing for a long time. I had to stopped in the middle of the ramp and wait for the pain to stop. To add to my frustration, here come another hostess asking me to move or she will get my name off the plane! I explained that I am having a cramp and just need a couple of minutes. The lady repeated herself saying that I needed to move or else my name will be removed from the plane. When she saw I ignored her and was still holding my hip she run off to the counter saying - ""that’s it, I am removing your name from the flight"".. I was really shocked I have never had in one encounter so many unkind people. This was a night flight and I imagine everyone was exhausted but the treatment I received was beyond unimaginable. The humiliation over and over again. I am so disappointed and really hope this company starts holding their employees accountable for the way they treat their customers.",Air Canada,"not verified | with over 15 years of travel experience

the extra bag. so, i transferred everything to a small bag i had inside and to my other bags. when she weighed everything, one bag was 21 kg and the other 25 (2 kgs over the limit). she requested i remove the extra 2 kg or pay 100 $. i managed to remove the extra weight which she accepted. to my surprise at the gate, the hostess flags my boarding pass during boarding literally calling me a thief because i failed to pay the overweight and oversize fee. i was shocked, i tried to explain that this was an error and there is no way i made it through the security without paying. the hostess flat out told me i was lying and that there was no way for them to know i was telling the truth. they made me wait until all passengers boarded then a supervisor came and confirmed that i was telling the truth and that the clerk made a mistake. i was finally allowed to board. please note: no apologies were offered for the inconvenience. as i was walking to the airplane to board, i started to experience some cramps in my hips since i was standing for a long time. i had to stopped in the middle of the ramp and wait for the pain to stop. to add to my frustration, here come another hostess asking me to move or she will get my name off the plane! i explained that i am having a cramp and just need a couple of minutes. the lady repeated herself saying that i needed to move or else my name will be removed from the plane. when she saw i ignored her and was still holding my hip she run off to the counter saying - ""that’s it, i am removing your name from the flight"".. i was really shocked i have never had in one encounter so many unkind people. this was a night flight and i imagine everyone was exhausted but the treatment i received was beyond unimaginable. the humiliation over and over again. i am so disappointed and really hope this company starts holding their employees accountable for the way they treat their customers.",Not Verified |  With over 15 years of travel

66,66,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a domestic flight (In the same province) originally on July 30th for 1:20pm. I showed up at Vancouver Airport at 12:00pm. It was my mistake this day for showing up too close to the time and I had to cancel because I missed the flight. Went back home All good I booked the flight through Expedia, got a refund and my expedia account was re-issued the credits again. Booked through Expedia for another flight for the next day to the same location. Flight was scheduled for 8:05am. Ok I decided to show up 2 and a half hours before the flight just to be safe. Get to the airport at roughly 5:30am, standing in line to check in and the lineup doesn't look too long. But They only have 3 people working the computers and the line moves incredibly slow. After almost an hour and twenty minutes of waiting in line I start to panic because I have only made it a little over halfway through this lineup. I start flagging down Air Canada staff to alert them that I may miss my flight if things don't speed up. Alerted one girl and she said : ""ok sir, someone will be over to assist you."" 15 minutes goes by with no assistance and I alert another girl. She gives me the same line as the other girl. And the same exact outcome. Nobody comes to assist me. After 15 more minutes I hop over the rope to the counter and beg them to please have someone come over and help me, or I will miss my flight. Again the girl tries to re-assure me they will help me and tells me to get back in line. Well after 2+ hours in line, and not one Air Canada staff coming over to help After I had asked. I'm one person away from being helped at the front counter. And just feel defeated. I step up to the front and talk to the girl and she tells me immediately that I have missed my flight. I can't describe my frustration, I even left well before my flight just to be able to make the flight in time. Two and a half hours before my flight and I still missed it. And this was a domestic flight. I have never in my life had to give myself so much time to make a flight, let alone a hour and a half flight. And still miss the flight. Air Canada offered no compensation and also did not appear to have any sympathy for my situation. I still had to fly up that day to go up for work, so I was desperate to get on a flight. Luckily a Westjet flight to the same destination was available. I walked over to the Westjet lineup, which was the same size as the Air Canada lineup. Managed to get through the line, book my flight and check on my bag within 15 minutes. Yes, within 15 minutes I did all of that. To top it all off, I canceled my flight through Expedia. Got the credit for Air Canada flights on my expedia account. Decided to try and book another flight with my available credit, but the expedia representative told me he couldn't book it because Air Canada had suspended my ticket, and I needed to call Air Canada to open it. Try to call Air Canada and they said they aren't taking any calls at the moment. Anyways I'm stuck with a 900$ balance for Air Canada that I now can't use until they get back to me. And will probably have to book through westjet to get back home which means even more money I will have to shell out due to Air Canada.

67,67,"✅ Trip Verified |  I use to travel with Air Canada for many years and never had any issues. Since the past 3 years I've encountered several problem that I am now doubting Air Canada. On my way from BC to California the entire way was pretty smooth and the pilot was friendly along with the staff. The problem was coming back from California to BC. Unfortunately my flight got delayed by 25 minutes when I landed in BC I had a connecting flight. I had to undergo the entire PCR, boarder security check. When I spoke to Air Canada I told them I have a connecting flight and with the looks of it I may not make it. I was told its okay we have time and my check-in was done so they will hold the flight for me. I got to security screening and long line up, I than again told the Air Canada person I have a connecting flight I need to go my flight will leave AT 5:20 which means boarding must've ended at 5:05 and I was at security till 5:10. I than rushed so fast to get to the gate and my flight took off! Air Canada did put me on another flight that took off at 8:45PM.  I do not understand why Air Canada couldn't just tell me from the start that they will put me on another flight and shouldn't my name be called when someone is running late or is behind?",Air Canada,"✅ trip verified | i use to travel with air canada for many years and never had any issues. since the past 3 years i've encountered several problem that i am now doubting air canada. on my way from bc to california the entire way was pretty smooth and the pilot was friendly along with the staff. the problem was coming back from california to bc. unfortunately my flight got delayed by 25 minutes when i landed in bc i had a connecting flight. i had to undergo the entire pcr, boarder security check. when i spoke to air canada i told them i have a connecting flight and with the looks of it i may not make it. i was told its okay we have time and my check-in was done so they will hold the flight for me. i got to security screening and long line up, i than again told the air canada person i have a connecting flight i need to go my flight will leave at 5:20 which means boarding must've ended at 5:05 and i was at security till 5:10. i than rushed so fast to get to the gate and my flight took off! air canada did put me on another flight that took off at 8:45pm. i do not understand why air canada couldn't just tell me from the start that they will put me on another flight and shouldn't my name be called when someone is running late or is behind?", Trip Verified |  I use to travel with Air Canada for many years and never had any issues Since the past 3 years Ive encountered several problem that I am now doubting Air Canada On my way from BC to California the entire way was pretty smooth and the pilot was friendly along with the staff The problem was coming back from California to BC Unfortunately my flight got delayed by 25 minutes when I landed in BC I had a connecting flight I had to undergo the entire PCR boarder security check When I spoke to Air Canada I told them I have a connecting flight and with the looks of it I may not make it I was told its okay we have time and my checkin was done so they will hold the flight for me I got to security screening and long line up I than again told the Air Canada person I have a connecting flight I need to go my flight will leave AT 520 which means boarding mustve ended at 505 and I was at security till 510 I than rushed so fast to get to the gate and my flight took off Air Canada did put me on another flight that took off at 845PM  I do not understand why Air Canada couldnt just tell me from the start that they will put me on another flight and shouldnt my name be called when someone is running late or is behind, Trip Verified |  I use to travel with Air Canada for many years and never had any issues Since the past 3 years Ive encountered several problem that I am now doubting Air Canada On my way from BC to California the entire way was pretty smooth and the pilot was friendly along with the staff The problem was coming back from California to BC Unfortunately my flight got delayed by 25 minutes when I landed in BC I had a connecting flight I had to undergo the entire PCR boarder security check When I spoke to Air Canada I told them I have a connecting flight and with the looks of it I may not make it I was told its okay we have time and my checkin was done so they will hold the flight for me I got to security screening and long line up I than again told the Air Canada person I have a connecting flight I need to go my flight will leave AT 520 which means boarding mustve ended at 505 and I was at security till 510 I than rushed so fast to get to the gate and my flight took off Air Canada did put me on another flight that took off at 845PM  I do not understand why Air Canada couldnt just tell me from the start that they will put me on another flight and shouldnt my name be called when someone is running late or is behind,Trip Verified | I use travel Air Canada many years never issues Since past 3 years Ive encountered several problem I doubting Air Canada On way BC California entire way pretty smooth pilot friendly along staff The problem coming back California BC Unfortunately flight got delayed 25 minutes I landed BC I connecting flight I undergo entire PCR boarder security check When I spoke Air Canada I told I connecting flight looks I may make I told okay time checkin done hold flight I got security screening long line I told Air Canada person I connecting flight I need go flight leave AT 520 means boarding mustve ended 505 I security till 510 I rushed fast get gate flight took Air Canada put another flight took 845PM I understand Air Canada couldnt tell start put another flight shouldnt name called someone running late behind
68,68,"✅ Trip Verified |  Still not sure why it is taking over four months to get a refund from covid tickets bought last September. Originally forced to get aeroplan points, then we could get refund via original form of payment. In April the refund site would at least tell you what date of originally purchased tickets refund they were working on. Then May 26th they stopped reporting any dates at all also basically said don’t call customer service, they can’t give you information. I have a diary of all the times I’ve reached out and never have I heard of a major company being so distant to the consumer.

I was told that she has talked to other people who have been waiting nine months (is this supposed to make me feel better?) she will send up my information and “they” should let me know something shortly. ",Air Canada,"✅ trip verified | still not sure why it is taking over four months to get a refund from covid tickets bought last september. originally forced to get aeroplan points, then we could get refund via original form of payment. in april the refund site would at least tell you what date of originally purchased tickets refund they were working on. then may 26th they stopped reporting any dates at all also basically said don’t call customer service, they can’t give you information. i have a diary of all the times i’ve reached out and never have i heard of a major company being so distant to the consumer. yesterday (8/24) i finally took on the 1hr hold thru customer service just trying to get information. i was told that she has talked to other people who have been waiting nine months (is this supposed to make me feel better?) she will send up my information and “they” should let me know something shortly.", Trip Verified |  Still not sure why it is taking over four months to get a refund from covid tickets bought last September Originally forced to get aeroplan points then we could get refund via original form of payment In April the refund site would at least tell you what date of originally purchased tickets refund they were working on Then May 26th they stopped reporting any dates at all also basically said dont call customer service they cant give you information I have a diary of all the times Ive reached out and never have I heard of a major company being so distant to the consumer  Yesterday 824 I finally took on the 1hr hold thru customer service just trying to get information I was told that she has talked to other people who have been waiting nine months is this supposed to make me feel better she will send up my information and they should let me know something shortly , Trip Verified |  Still not sure why it is taking over four months to get a refund from covid tickets bought last September Originally forced to get aeroplan points then we could get refund via original form of payment In April the refund site would at least tell you what date of originally purchased tickets refund they were working on Then May 26th they stopped reporting any dates at all also basically said dont call customer service they cant give you information I have a diary of all the times Ive reached out and never have I heard of a major company being so distant to the consumer  Yesterday 824 I finally took on the 1hr hold thru customer service just trying to get information I was told that she has talked to other people who have been waiting nine months is this supposed to make me feel better she will send up my information and they should let me know something shortly ,Trip Verified | Still sure taking four months get refund covid tickets bought last September Originally forced get aeroplan points could get refund via original form payment In April refund site would least tell date originally purchased tickets refund working Then May 26th stopped reporting dates also basically said dont call customer service cant give information I diary times Ive reached never I heard major company distant consumer Yesterday 824 I finally took 1hr hold thru customer service trying get information I told talked people waiting nine months supposed make feel better send information let know something shortly
69,69,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight in Chicago had a 4 hour delay so we were delayed, almost missed our connection Air Canada let everyone off the plane instead of just the people with the imminent connections. Being on the back of the plane, things didn't look good Following that the agents barely listened to our questions on how to get to connections in time; instead directed us to customs and immigration. After 30 minutes in line, got to the customs agent, he says, ""why are you here? I'll walk you to connections."" Of course we missed the plane. Then the air Canada customer support agent in Toronto was useless. He let it slip that just the 4 of us missed our flight. And that it was our problem. We couldn't leave the airport and gave us one hotel room for 4 people. Went to CBP and again, they say ""why weren't you escorted""? We weren't supposed to walk where the Air Canada agents sent us alone.  I did file for reimbursement, but judging by the job Air Canada's done so far, that won't happen. They proceeded to lose our luggage and return it to us on our 9th and last day of our trip. Followed by not letting part of our party board because our recovery letter didn't said ""recovered from covid"" xx date signed by a doctor but missed the words ""for travel.""

70,70,"Not Verified |  Will try to never fly with Air Canada again after our experience.  Minutes before we were to board the final leg of a return flight from Rome, Italy - the Toronto to IAD Washington leg - AC7708, that flight was cancelled by Air Canada. All the passengers on what we were told was a full flight were directed to the AC customer services desk elsewhere in the airport. When we arrived there we learned another AC flight to Pittsburgh had also been cancelled. The Washington bound group joined at the back of this line of what was probably 300+ people. Over the next three+ hours no announcements to all the people in line were offered by AC customer service staff. At various times when Canadian citizen passengers, who were given vouchers on the spot and escorted past us out of the terminal by AC customer service staff, different AC staff gave incomplete and varying information in response to questions from non-Canadian citizen passengers. We were told we could not leave that area of the terminal due to Covid restrictions. We were told it would be days for us to find flights to final destinations - especially if there were multiple passengers on one booking etc. The total lack of guidance by AC staff to passengers led many to search for options. Also the customer service line was not moving as they were short staffed and having major computer rebooking issues. With 10pm approaching, no movement in the rebooking line, horror stories from other US passengers closer to the AC desk hearing rebooked flights for Thursday soonest etc., we felt we had to act. We began hearing also that Airport Security would not let us remain in the airport overnight. We secured a one-way car rental and drove 9 hours back to DC. At no time was a hotel stay offered by Air Canada or any talk of a voucher due to the cancellation. It was a total failure by them to communicate guidance for a situation that they - not the weather or other forces beyond their control - had caused.

71,71,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was travelling from Los Angeles to Montreal by Air Canada along with my family yesterday. The plane we supposed to board got delayed for two and half hours at Los Angeles airport, we received food voucher there by an Air Canada agent. After landing at Toronto we got stuck on the plane for another one hour because of the traffic. Because of the covid situation we had to do our immigration and baggage claim in the Toronto airport. We were told by the Air Canada we will get hotel vouchers as we missed our connected flight because of the delay. We were directed to aisle number 7 and 8 of Air Canada for the hotels voucher. After waiting for about 3 hours in the queue when we got a chance to see the rep at the counter we were told that we are not eligible for the hotel voucher. And the representative didn’t want to help us and constantly misbehaving with us.  Later the manager explained it was not the airlines fault as we got delayed by the customs at Los Angeles airport. But we didn’t do our custom at Los Angeles. And he also added we will not get hotel voucher and will not get any compensation.  Such a bad customer service.

72,72,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked my flight from Toronto to Kamloops via Vancouver using reward points in June 2021. I booked my seat at the time of booking the flight - choosing 2A. A couple of days later I received a notification that my seat had been changed to 3A - not a big deal. On the 14th of August, I checked in online for my flight. A minute or two after checking in I received a notification that my seat was being changed to 28D - economy class, and minute or so after that another notification that my seat was changed again to 19D (may have been premium economy). I went into my bookings on the Air Canada website and my seat still showed as 3A. Next morning just to be sure I phoned Air Canada and after 1 hour 22 minutes, the agent confirmed I was in 3A from what she could see. I went to the airport and checked in at the counter and the agent printed me a boarding card for 19D. Told him this was not acceptable and explained what had taken place the day before. He then found an open seat in business class - seat 1D and gave me a new boarding card with my baggage tag attached. While going through security my phone alerted me to a message indicated my seat had changed and I was now in 27J (economy), and a few minutes later a new seat change to 21D, and then another change to 12D (Premium economy). Asked the agents in the lounge and they said I should go to the gate and check as it is a involuntary downgrade. The agent at the gate had my new boarding card for 12D. He said however I should wait until the entire plane boarded in case someone was a no show in business class. I ended up in 12D. There was absolutely no explanation as to why any of this happened, and how a person who has paid for business class (even if it was with points) can have their seat changed after they have checked in for the flight. It is now five days later and Air Canada has not compensated me. On top of this my connecting flight to Kamloops was cancelled due to weather and when I went to collect my bag and could not find it I realized that the agent did not transfer my baggage tag on my original boarding card to the new one printed. My take on this is that someone who was paying cash/credit for business class was given my seat as I was deemed dispensable because I purchased mine with my Aeroplan points. To not be offered an explanation or compensation is disgusting.

73,73,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked my flight from Toronto to Winnipeg for August 16, 2021. I reached at check in line at about 19.15 and i told one of the lady employee standing there that i have a flight at 20.30 and she told me to wait in line that you still have a time. When i reached to the counter it was about 19.50 and the lady denied me to board the flight saying that I am late for check in.  Even when i asked what i can do now as i know nobody in Toronto she said she cant do anything in it and she just gave me option that i have to get another ticket from her different day flight.

Breakfast was even more pathetic: the menu said it was a croissant but it came in a plastic wrap with some fruit, etc. Given the state of breakfast, she could have easily served it to me when requested.

82,82,"✅ Trip Verified |  I've flown with Air Canada more than any other airline in the past 5 years, and I've always ignored small unpleasant comments from ground and flight staff as well as poor organization and flight problems because flying Air Canada was often the only option available (or at least slightly more affordable) and I accepted it as a means to an end. However, my experience this week was awful. It started with a 3.5 to 4-hour line  to the check-in counter. We were told that self check-in isn't available so everyone had to wait in a single line. Most people ended up missing their flights. The airline only had four counters available and would not offer any communication to anyone who was worried about their flight.  At one point many of us reaching the front of the line were asked to break off and form a new line off to the side to make more space. After about 45 minutes of waiting, a new staff member asked us why we were standing there and told us our line doesn't lead anywhere. She told us we have to go back to the end of the line we were previously in if we wanted to be served. When other passengers became frustrated and mentioned that we have been waiting the longest and were asked to stand there, the ground staff responded that it wasn't true and that there was no way we've been waiting for 3 hours so far. Some people reacted by yelling while others started to cry from frustration. Once I finally made it to the check-in counter, I was told that all the other flights to Boston that day were full so my only option was to be placed on stand-by for all the flights in hopes that one of them would have extra space. I was told to wait at each gate one hour before a flight departs to see if my name was called. Luckily, I was able to board a flight that day and made it to Boston in the evening. When I arrived, my luggage was nowhere to be found. I went to the luggage service desk to inquire about it and was told that my luggage was not put on my flight because there was too much weight on the flight and it was better to take all the passengers to their destination than load all the luggage. If I knew this would have been the case, I would have much preferred to not board my flight and keep my personal items than arrive in a different country without my belongings. I was told the luggage would arrive on another flight and could be delivered to the place I was staying on the next day. I left all my contact information and had to hope for the best. The next day, I checked the online status of my luggage and it said that it had been loaded onto a delivery truck at 2pm. I waited and waited for it to arrive, but nothing came. I called Air Canada and they told me that the luggage will arrive anytime before 11:30pm. I didn't want to miss the delivery so I spent the first day of my trip just waiting.

that my luggage was not put on my flight because there was too much weight on the flight and it was better to take all the passengers to their destination than load all the luggage If I knew this would have been the case I would have much preferred to not board my flight and keep my personal items than arrive in a different country without my belongings I was told the luggage would arrive on another flight and could be delivered to the place I was staying on the next day I left all my contact information and had to hope for the best The next day I checked the online status of my luggage and it said that it had been loaded onto a delivery truck at 2pm I waited and waited for it to arrive but nothing came I called Air Canada and they told me that the luggage will arrive anytime before 1130pm I didnt want to miss the delivery so I spent the first day of my trip just waiting By midnight no one had arrived It is now the next day and Im still waiting Air Canada is unable to reach the delivery company, Trip Verified |  Ive flown with Air Canada more than any other airline in the past 5 years and Ive always ignored small unpleasant comments from ground and flight staff as well as poor organization and flight problems because flying Air Canada was often the only option available or at least slightly more affordable and I accepted it as a means to an end However my experience this week was awful It started with a 35 to 4hour line  to the checkin counter We were told that self checkin isnt available so everyone had to wait in a single line Most people ended up missing their flights The airline only had four counters available and would not offer any communication to anyone who was worried about their flight  At one point many of us reaching the front of the line were asked to break off and form a new line off to the side to make more space After about 45 minutes of waiting a new staff member asked us why we were standing there and told us our line doesnt lead anywhere She told us we have to go back to the end of the line we were previously in if we wanted to be served When other passengers became frustrated and mentioned that we have been waiting the longest and were asked to stand there the ground staff responded that it wasnt true and that there was no way weve been waiting for 3 hours so far Some people reacted by yelling while others started to cry from frustration Once I finally made it to the checkin counter I was told that all the other flights to Boston that day were full so my only option was to be placed on standby for all the

83,83,"✅ Trip Verified |  Supposed to be my original flight was July 31st YWG to YVR then YVR to NRT via Air Canada and layover of 24h 20m HND to MNL via Philippine Airlines. My flight schedule was changed several times by another booking agency. The time I was about to check-in in Winnipeg, Air Canada didn’t give me my boarding pass and didn’t allow me to board my plane because according to them, my layover in Japan should only be less than 24 hours in order for me not to avail a transit visa. I researched a couple of times before my flight and I found out that a passenger is allowed to transit to Japan without a visa up to 72 hours with a confirmed ticket and if there are no available flights on the said date of arrival. Air Canada told me to call my booking agency and to adjust my layover time. But there are no longer available flights possible for that day. I was forced to book a new plane ticket amounting to $2937.46 including taxes on an economy ticket for the next day.  Air Canada was so useless and I felt so disappointed because I have to travel back home again for an hour travel time and my brother who fetched me to the airport was already gone back home.  I found the airline very inconsiderate and I hope they will update their policies regarding transit visas.

86,86,"Not Verified |  I recently made reservations for a flight from Toronto to Newark on June 30th. My original reservation was for 230pm and arriving in Newark at 401pm. My flight was cancelled while sitting on the plane waiting for it to takeoff. The reason for the cancellation was ""a tornado warning."" Meanwhile in Newark it was 98 degrees and sunny. Everyone from that flight was made to stand on a long line while waiting on ONE customer service representative to attend to the 100 plus people from my flight and trying to assist an additional 50 plus people that had flights to other destinations. Needless to say the 50 plus people that had flights to other destinations were attended to while myself and the passengers that had been deplaned were told after an hour to come back tomorrow because our flight had been postponed to 8am the following day (July 1st). We had made reservations to drive from Newark to Ocean City MD for a two night stay but due to Air Canada we did not make it and we were only able to enjoy half a day and a one night stay and due to it being the Fourth of July no extensions were being offered.

So I missed the 1030am flight, and went downstairs to get a rapid PCR test done. $250 USD later I received a negative PCR test and made my way back to the Air Canada counter to see if I was able to get on a later flight.  When I approached the Air Canada counter the gentleman rudely tried to give me a card with Air Canada's Customer service number (that I have been trying to call for days to find out information regarding Covid testing) I told him ""please don't try to give me that number you know  that no one answers that phone."" He went to the back to supposedly speak to someone and then quickly came back to me and stated ""We have another flight at 430pm but we are fully booked so we cannot help you. Anyways you should try United because it is their fault for allowing you on that flight this morning with the wrong test."" Long story short, I went over to the United counter and the gentleman who I believe was the supervisor,  stated to me that he would ""try his best to put me on a flight to Toronto.""

88,88,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew business class on Air Canada from Newark to Doha via Toronto. I was connecting to my favorite airline, Qatar. I was looking forward to the service. However, AC was terrible. Check in at EWR was hectic. The agents did not pay attention to detail and gave me boarding passes belonging to someone else. Not a huge deal.  My flight arrived to Toronto late and I arrived at the gate just as they were calling for final boarding. I went to the agent and gave her all of the documentation she asked for without comment as I was catching my breath. At the end of it all, she said, ""you could be nicer you know"" I asked what her problem was and that I had given her everything that she asked for and that she was not particularly nice either.  The flight was terrible for business class. They had one menu with no options. The dinner was good, but breakfast was inedible. The seat was very comfortable and the flight attendants friendly. However, Air Canada has taken cost cutting in business class to a low. I connect to Qatar on a five hour flight. They had numerous menu options and better good. It is interesting how North Americans want to complain about the Middle Eastern carriers and their subsidies. However, the North American carriers get subsidies as well. Where they can't compete is service. If I am spending over $3000 on a business class ticket, and my choices are Air Canada or a Middle Eastern carrier, I would be a fool to spend my money on Air Canada.

90,90,"✅ Trip Verified | Booked on-line a same day/one-way flight from Ottawa to Toronto on Easter Sunday. On-line booking and seat selection was normal although when the booking was made (just after lunch), there was only one flight for the remainder of the day. Booked a seat in Economy class and upgraded to Business Class on check-in at the airport. Security was moderately busy but once again, CATSA screening staff at Ottawa Airport were disinterested and not helpful (showed my boarding pass and was motioned to join the long economy queue, asked if that was the business line and then was motioned to join mid-way rather than being directed to the priority queue). After security, walked to the gate (Maple Leaf lounge at Ottawa is currently closed) and boarding was just commencing. Boarded quickly onto the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft and found my upgraded seat (4A) without issue. Flight departed on schedule. In-flight service consisted of a box lunch/snack along with a small water bottle, bag of pretzels, ear buds, promotional flyer about cleanliness protocols and sanitizing wipes. Seat was comfortable and in-flight crew were both attentive and professional. Flight arrived early and taxi in to the gate was quick.

And with the support team, there are a myriad of excuses as to why the funds have not been processed.

99,99,"Not Verified |  My wife and I booked flights through Flight Network but chose Air Canada as the carrier. We had to cancel our flight due to COVID-19 back in June. We went back and forth with Flight Network to try and get our Air Canada travel voucher (we were owed). Even Air Canada customer relations told us we had to go through the 3rd party provider to collect the voucher that Air Canada had already sent to them. We made a final plea with Air Canada to please cancel the travel voucher they sent to Flight Network and send directly to us. Air Canada came through. The customer service agent was very understanding and really came through for us. No more booking through Flight Network. We will book directly through Air Canada now.

Delays after delays without compensation, and whenever I go to the kiosk to ask them to put me on a different connecting flight, they are always reluctant and would tell me to contact Ctrip directly (where I originally booked my ticket).

114,114,"✅ Trip Verified |  Air Canada changed the flight itinerary for a Toronto-Seattle flight, and I could no longer make the flight due to this change. They offered to convert the value of my flight ($350) into a credit that I could use at a later date. I thought this was great, and proceeded to apply the credit to a different flight (Toronto-Dublin) which costs $590 on the AirCanada website, taxes included (Image attached). I would've expected that my $350 credit would be applied to the new $590 flight, and I'd just have to pay the remaining balance of $240. This is not what happened. The credit of $350 was only good for $43 dollars on this new flight, and the rest of the credit vanished ($307), and I'm now at a net expense of $853 because I was charged an additional $546 ""tax charge"" for the new Dublin flight booking (on top of the remaining $307 credit value that couldn't be applied and doesn't exist anymore). I was not informed that it would have been better to use my credit for the same Toronto-Seattle route, instead of applying the credit to a new destination where the taxes aren't transferable. So after realizing this on my own, I then tried to cancel that new booking to Dublin and receive a refund for the $546, as it was still within 24 hours of the booking confirmation. This way I could keep my original $350 credit to save for a later date to use for Seattle specifically, and get full use of the credit value, and just book the Dublin flight separately on my own. However, they said this was also not possible, as a new booking made with a credit isn't the same as a regular booking, so the 24 hour rule doesn't apply, and I'm left short $307 in credit value that doesn't exist. I've contacted their customer relations department, and they've responded saying they cannot assist me.  I've had multiple trip cancellations with other airlines, where my credits were kept and applied for the full value of the ticket. I don't understand how $350 dollars in credit only becomes $43 in usable valuable, while the rest goes down the drain. Don't advertise increased flexibility with credits and vouchers, when in fact they are imaginary and will leave you short hundreds of dollars. I hope this helps with other people who aren't sure what to do about a flight credit/ voucher with Air Canada.

118,118,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a flight 5 months in advance, from the booking date to two weeks before departure my flights kept on changing until i had 8 flights overlapping. There was no contact from Air Canada about the flight changes, I thought it was a technical issue with the app but when the problem was not resolved I contacted customer service and was told I would have to stay over night at my own expense at connecting airports on both directions. So my flight I paid extra for, to be as short as possible, was originally 6 hours there and back became 28 and 22 hours with no other option. It took 3 days of contacting customer support to get a reasonable flight rebooked. They wanted an extra 1200$ per ticket to change which would be triple of my original ticket and would take more than double the travel time. At multiple airports the counter staff tried moving me and my wife to opposite sides of the plane and called me selfish for not agreeing to their terms. Saying ""you are so me me me"" on top of the poor customer service the policy for free seat selection during 24 hour checkin changed and I had to pay an extra 98$ to sit next to my wife again!

125,125,"✅ Trip Verified |  In December 2019 Air Canada cancelled my return ticket home while I was in Colombia. The return ticket included one domestic leg (Cartagena to Bogota) then two more legs, first to Toronto and then Vancouver. I missed the boarding call for the third leg of my incoming ticket so Air Canada, without even contacting me, cancelled all three of my flights home. After I missed my final short flight from Bogota to Medellin, I purchased another ticket from Latam Airlines, the local carrier for my last flight.  I spent six days using international minutes trying to reach Air Canada from Medellin. I tried everything under the sun to get a human voice on the line. Finally a friend of mine in Canada reached them, and after two and a half hours, got my flights home (the ones I’d already paid for) reinstated for $150. The money is the least of my concerns. The fact that Air Canada was unreachable is unprofessional.  Air Canada also left my luggage in Toronto and took their sweet time getting it to me.

139,139,"✅ Trip Verified | Vancouver to Hong Kong. First things first, I flew business class after Covid-19 measures were implemented, so I came in expecting reduced cabin service, and that was what I got. That being said, even with all the precautionary measures, I was surprised that they were still able to put a somewhat decent service together. Air Canada uses the B/E Aerospace (Now Collins Aerospace) Super Diamond seats, which arrange passengers in a reverse herringbone configuration. It's a pretty standard product, though I must say I really like the colour scheme that Air Canada uses. It just looks really clean and the colours contrast nicely. Due COVID-19, I requested the upgrade to business as a precautionary measure, and I wasn't disappointed. Even with reduced cabin services, it was still a nice experience. Sure, there's no pillow or bar service- they've warned about this on their website, but as it turned out, when they said they would be serving pre-packaged meals, all they meant was that they weren't going to plate your meal for you. It was still business quality (veal from Hawksworth), but they simply didn't give you that picture perfect plating that is so greatly appreciated. Despite the lack of a pillow, the seats were still quite comfortable, though it could still do with more lumbar support, and the lack of a pillow made the sleeping position a tad awkward because my head was dipped backwards even with the power adjustable headrest. Service could admittedly be a bit more polished, though to be fair, part of this definitely has to do with the COVID-19 precautions. I should probably try upgrading again when this blows over. I do appreciate how quiet the cabin was, and was pleasantly surprised to see that the food quality was not compromised as a result of their infection control measures.",Air Canada,"✅ trip verified |

153,153,"✅ Trip Verified |  Washington to Quebec City via Montreal. We boarded the flight, but while we were awaiting takeoff we had to evacuate the plane due to a mechanical issue. After waiting a couple of hours for counter assistance, we were rebooked for another flight. We were advised that we could not continue on to Quebec that night, but would be rebooked for a flight the next day. Unfortunately, the flight was also delayed again and we arrived quite late When we arrived in Montreal the counter agents deliberated over whether we qualified for lodging as we had been promised, and we received a lecture on Air Canada’s cancelation policies. We were eventually provided hotel and meal vouchers, given directions to the shuttle, and confirmed our reservations for the flight for the next day. Our flight was cancelled the next morning due to weather, and we received an email notification that we were rescheduled for a flight two days later. We called Customer Service to see if we could get an earlier flight; the representative informed us we were scheduled for the earliest flight he could get us on to Quebec City. Since we would not have had any time 8n Quebec we decided to cancel our vacation and requested return flights Our return flight was delayed due to “Crew Availability Issues”. This delay would cause us to miss connecting flight in Ottawa. We immediately contacted the Air Canada agent at the boarding desk, who rescheduled us onto a direct flight to our home. Our Air Canada experience can be summarized as such: two flight cancellations, one for mechanical issues and one weather related; three delays, causing us to miss connections; cancellation of our Quebec Winter Carnival vacation plans; computer issues, and a stressful experience for my wife and me I think you can agree our experience with Air Canada was not universally positive. I think it is important to emphasize that if our original flight had not been cancelled for mechanical issues we would have arrived in Québec City before the snowstorm and enjoyed our vacation. We filed a claim with Air Canada for our (first) cancelled flight based on your policy of recompense for cancelled and delayed flights. Their official response was to claim the flight cancellation was beyond their control, but offered us a 15% discount on our next Air Canada flight. We have requested reimbursement for the Montreal to Quebec and return leg of our trip that we could not take.

160,160,"Not Verified |  I have to say that we were relatively surprised on a recent return trip from Sydney to Vancouver and back. The departures were within 10 minutes of planned take-off times, and arrivals were either on-time or early. Check-in at both airports was very straight-forward and special thanks to the lovely ground staff lady at Vancouver who helped with our self check-in / bag drop at the airport. The crew did their job but lack the polish and personal attention to detail that you receive with the likes of Emirates and Qatar (which is one of the reasons why they are among the worlds best airlines, and Air Canada isn't). We flew Premium Economy and I'm glad we did as I felt sorry for any passengers flying in economy in a full plane on the return flight. The food service in PE was poor with rubbery, burnt omelette, rock hard bread rolls and tasteless chicken on the return route - not helped by being offered only one small glass of wine. While the entertainment system was very good and extremely easy to navigate, the earphones offered in PE were next to useless. The provision of toilets on the aircraft was rather disproportionate with 5 lavatories for 260 economy / premium economy passengers against 3 for 40 business passengers.

The biz class seats are much nicer from when we last flew them 6 years ago. There is more room and more storage space and a mattress pad as well. We both managed too get comfortable sleep at the beginning of this 14.5 hr. flight. The food was very good and plentiful. I slept through breakfast so th FA'S whipped up a snack of cheeses, chicken Tikka and a nice Cognac to go with it. Our lunch was amazing. I had lamb chops, salad, and mashed with a nice chilled Molson and then there was desert, a fluffy butterscotch torte, cheeses and ice cream, and a Couvasier Cognac to follo and Lavazza coffee. The IFE system was very easy to use and had a lot of options for movies, TV, music, etc. too many to list and the hand held device was easy to use.

They gave us mini oatmeal bars to help us wait, and half glass of water. They blame external circumstances (last time was: not enough employees to defrost the plane). Even for very simple flights like Montreal - NYC or Montreal - Miami they are late. Last time I went to Miami, flight delayed of 6 hours. Last time I went to NYC (1 hour flight), flight delayed of 2 hours. Don’t bother bringing a carry on: they never have space for them.

169,169,"Not Verified | Toronto to Rome via London. Air Canada treats Aeroplan members as second class citizens I am posting this warning to all those you fly with Air Canada and who use air miles to book flights. Air Canada clearly discriminates amongst its passengers. This is now my second experience and hence definitive confirmation of these discriminatory practices. I recently booked a flight to Europe from Toronto using my aeroplan miles. Upon booking my 2 flights I went through the seat selection process, selected seats and paid $125 each for that privilege. The payment was processed by Air Canada and written confirmation received of those specific seat allocations via email. Weeks later I received an “Air Canada – SEAT CHANGE” notification, arbitrarily moving our seats from Row 18 (seats bought and paid for – for extra legroom due to a leg issue I have) to Row 33. and then said I would be refunded the seat selection fees. Completely arbitrary and not honoring the initial seat purchase! Since this was the second time this has happened to me, (the first time being much worse, which I will explain later on in this message) I had to speak out. I immediately emailed Air Canada after trying to get a hold of their customer service Dept – advised by an automated call that the wait time was more than 1.5 hrs - really? Maybe this is a factor of the significant quantum of customer complaint volume. I then received the token automated response to my submission form Air Canada “we will address your concern within 30 days”. Hence my public action here! As noted this is the second time this has happened. In 2018, on flights to/from Miami for attending a family wedding, I had booked 4 seats using Aeroplan miles and paid full fare for one seat (full-fare seat for my disabled father) in upgraded seating. We booked almost 8 months in advance, with the express purpose of early booking, being getting our seats assigned together so as to assist my disabled father on/off the plan and supporting him during the flights. Eight months early! All our seat selections were confirmed in writing to us by Air Canada at that time. Again, just before the flight (a week before) we get a notification that our seats were changed. Let me clarify this point - only our Aeroplan booked seats were changed! Not my father’s full-fare seat! I called to complain, they said it just happens. It was too close to the flight to seek any other remedy. In the end, it left us sitting in the back of the plane and my father sitting alone with strangers and without support to deal with his disability! Unbelievable! After our return, I complained through proper AC channels to ascertain the genesis of the change notice, highlighting the blatant fact that only the seats booked with air miles were changed and not full-fare seat. The AC response again was, it happens! The offered me a 25% discount coupon for a future flight. I don’t want coupons! I want honest, fair and non-discriminatory service from a Canadian company. Disgraceful! Now this has happened again and cannot stay silent as it is now clear beyond any doubt that Air Canada discriminates against its passengers. There is one level of service for full-fare passengers and another for Aeroplan members who use air miles to book flights.

183,183,"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Calgary, B777-300ER economy class. Having flown to and from Europe to and from YYC on Air Canada several times and exclusively since September, I was hoping for a standardized product in economy class. Each time, something has been a bit missing: poor French skills, inaudible captain PA's, etc. The food, entertainment, and cabin cleanliness was relatively standard, including this time.

He looked at a sheet of paper on his cart, then looked above at my seat row and number then offered the meal item and snack item.

192,192,"Not Verified | Calgary to Frankfurt via Mumbai. The flight was delayed out of Calgary due mostly waiting for deicing as the weather was not horrible. Upon departure with almost 1.5 hours initial delay, the plane finally made it to Frankfurt with just 1 hour delay. However, they could not make sure that the passengers that were connecting to a Lufthansa flight to Mumbai with just 1.5 hrs connecting time could at least make it to their flight.

They started playing with their fares to make it as confusing as possible to get as much money as possible from the customer.

We got a booking confirmation also stating that we had in fact paid the Standard Economy fare and that our luggage was included. When we showed up at the airport however, with four pieces of luggage for the whole family, we had to pay 240 CHF additional per way.

We got no help from the Air Canada counter and we could not reach anyone on the phone after an hour of waiting.

202,202,"✅ Trip Verified |  Connecting flight from Toronto to Halifax cancelled due to weather, ok understandable. Rebooked on flight later that night, which I got bumped from. One customer service agent at the desk provided really bad service too, I get that you're tired of dealing with customers but the lady was acting as if her flight got cancelled. She even complained to her colleague about having to hold with Air Canada when phoning to get help with the situation. So I'm put on the 10:00 flight for 06 Jan 2020, I even get checked in and get a boarding pass. An hour later I get an email saying I'm now bumped from this flight and on the 18:30 flight. This cannot be due to weather as the 10:00 flight is not cancelled. Now I've been on hold for over an hour waiting to speak with someone.

215,215,"Not Verified | Regina to Montreal via Toronto. What is described below is not a one-time occurrence, it has a rather disturbing high frequency on my travels. Paid for a more expensive flight to arrive earlier as I had an event. Wasted my money due to the delays. The departing flight (AC1114 from Regina to Toronto) was delayed due to ""additional flight preparation time"". The flight was then delayed two more times, to the point of missing my connection. To top it off, when consulting the departing gate to change the missed connection, was instructed to do so in Toronto. I made the big mistake of being nice to them and checked my carry on to assist them with space for other passengers. Big mistake as the whole Air Canada Toronto personnel that I consulted seemed to be trained to purposely do nothing to change a flight if baggage is checked. When requesting for an earlier flight, one of the people asked if I wanted to go on the next flight, to what I answer ""Yes!"" to then tell me he couldn't do it because of the checked luggage and telling me that he needed 1h and 15min for changing. Asked then for a flight apart 1.5 hrs, to what they say ""cannot do with checked luggage"". Do you notice the change of tone there? If this was a single occurrence, I would have said ""one time thing"" but this is the third time out of four flights I've got. Due to the frequency, I will avoid at all cost. I hope you do the same.

224,224,"✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve spent the last month attempting to organize my itinerary. I waited a total of 6 hrs on hold for their customer service line. Each time they hung up on me (before I could speak) or an answering machine informed me they couldn't even put me on hold or take my call. I had to make multiple trips to the airport to ask questions that should be cleared online or over the phone, though they failed to give such options which were available in the past. I understand they're reworking their ""system"" but this is insane.

227,227,"Not Verified |  The flight from Taipei to Vancouver was decent. But it was hard to get comfortable in the seats in order to catch some sleep on the 10 hour journey. What made us most angry was our treatment at Vancouver airport while trying to catch our connecting flight back to Toronto. We had less than 2 hours to go through customs, get our baggage, then recheck baggage before boarding. Of course going through security was slow and on top of that, baggage claim had mechanical issues so we were delayed another 10 minutes. By the time we reached baggage drop off, the agent simply told us too late and that we missed our flight. No explanation or any effort whatsoever to reach out to the agents boarding for our flight. We got redirected to a check in area where we were then booked as standby for the next flight with the agent telling us that we would most likely get on. Now we understand seats are not guaranteed but at least have the agents be a little empathetic about our situation that was not our fault. Cue boarding time for the standby flight: the agent was rude and bluntly told all standbys that we were not getting on. Naturally people were upset and wanted answers. But this particular agent was so rude and yelled back at everyone to shut up as there was nothing she can do on her end. Funny, I thought these agents are supposed to provide customer service? Didn't know being yelled at and made to feel like missing our original flight was part of their job description. I can understand feeling attacked when you have angry customers all come at you, but that's part of your job to be able to keep your cool in these situations! After a bit of yelling back and forth, she rebooked us all as standbys for the last flight of the night with a small chance of boarding as this was yet another full flight. She couldn't or wouldn't tell us what our other options are if we were to be denied this last flight as well. So here we are waiting for the last flight hoping to get on while we're all upset with how we were just treated. Long story short, the flight crew was lovely but ground staff? Please hire agents who actually care about helping passengers who are stuck here. It's not like we all voluntarily decided to skip our original flights in favour of playing chance with the later flights. Worst customer service experience we've ever experienced. Would highly recommend avoid flying with Air Canada if you can.

228,228,"✅ Trip Verified | On Sat 30 November 2019, I was due to fly from London to Chicago, via Toronto. I successfully completed the London to Toronto leg of my journey. All of my problems began with the Toronto to Chicago leg of this journey (UA 7673 on 30 November 2019). I boarded the plane, but was then told that there was a fault with the plane. All passengers were told to disembark the plane. I expected to be booked on to another flight for that day, but was informed by Air Canada Staff at the gate that there would be no further flights that day. I was told to collect my luggage and leave the airport. I was given the Air Canada customer support phone number and was told to contact them to arrange an alternative flight. I tried calling this number continuously for the next 12 hours. I was unable to get through to a customer support agent, despite holding for up to 4 hours! I kept getting a message saying that I could not be placed on hold, with a request to call back later. The message did not change for the whole time I was ringing! When I checked my booking online, I could see that my YYZ to ORD had been rescheduled for 4 days later (Wednesday 3 December 2019). This was despite the fact that there were numerous seats available on Air Canada flights between Toronto and Chicago on the 1st and 2nd of December. As I was unable to contact Air Canada customer support to arrange an alternative flight, I had no choice but to make my own arrangements for travel to Chicago. I proceeded to book a flight from Buffalo NY to Toronto for Sunday morning 1 December 2019 at 7.15 am. I am extremely disappointed by Air Canada. I understand that planes can occasionally develop a fault, leading to a cancellation.

234,234,"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Nashville via Toronto. Our Frankfurt to Toronto leg was perfect. Staff was friendly, plane was comfortable, and flight was great. Once landing in Toronto, the chaos ensued. Our Nashville leg was cancelled due to weather (freezing rain and snow). Totally understandable. However, what wasn't understandable was the sheer incompetence of the Air Canada agents that helped customers. Once we arrived at the connections gate for the US flights, there was 1 Air Canada agent helping over 200 people that needed a flight rebooked. On top of that, they apparently had a new rebooking system, so she couldn't actually rebook anyone without having to wait on the phone with another department to see if anything was available. The first person in line took 2 hours to get resolved. I was fourth in line. Finally my husband and I received a hotel voucher after about 2.5 hours of waiting in the line. They stopped trying to rebook anyone and just immediately gave us a hotel. Then they told us we need to call their reservations hotline to get rebooked. No one would rebook us without calling this number and the hold times for that number were over 2 hours and longer with frequent disconnects. We were told to exit customs and go downstairs to baggage claim to collect our stuff and head to the hotel. We waited 8 hours for our baggage and it never came.  We spoke to baggage agents 7 times and had them call our specific bag tag numerous times over with no luck. One agent even showed us a picture of our baggage scanned into the warehouse and knew the exact cage number it was stored in, but no one would retrieve it for us. Baggage agents instead walked around telling people to wait for carousel 10 to have their bags (which was futile) or openly started arguing with customers. ""Have you seen the weather? It's out of our control! There are many people here waiting, you need to wait!"" I asked one agent if he could radio for a manager and he said he couldn't, that there was no way for him to get a manager, and that he could not help. The customer service was atrocious. We all knew that weather was not something they could not control, but the baggage operations are within their control and it was a complete and utter failure.  After being awake for over 24 hours and trying endlessly to retrieve our baggage, we had to give up. The next morning we ended up hiring a limo service to take us to Buffalo in order to rent a car to get to Nashville. We were never able to contact the rebooking department for help and no one in the airport could help us.

246,246,"✅ Trip Verified | Booked the flight, Vancouver to San Diego return, because of the departure times. Sometime later the return flight was changed from 12.35 to 17.00 and now arriving into Vancouver at around 20.00 instead of around 15.39 but by now this was too late to get an alternative carrier. At San Diego airport time of departure was listed as on time but a little later was changed to 18.00 then 18.16.

250,250,"Not Verified |  Worst experience with an airline. We flew from Montego Bay to Toronto Canada as a layover. As we boarded the plane the Captain advised that it was snowing in Canada, but we will be on time. As we arrived to the Toronto airport we spent a hour and a half on the runway. Due to traffic and the airline plowing. You would think they would of plowed ahead of time or at least prepped for snow. So are connecting flight was boarding in 20 minutes as we lay in wait on the runway. We checked Air Canada site and it stated that our connecting flight was delayed 2 hours. So my wife and I believed we had time to make the connecting flight being that we were sitting for our an hour on the runway. Well we were wrong not only didn’t they let people with connecting flights exit off plane first but the staff and the website lied about the delay. (The connecting flight was on time) As we approached the gate to our flight we were stopped and not allowed to enter US customs because they closed at 9pm. We arrived at the gate at 849pm and had time to walked 50 feet to customs. But not to our knowledge Air Canada already rebooked our flight for the following day for 920pm without advising us. The staff was rude and blamed it on US customs even after we told them we have 11 minutes. Then they advised that we couldn’t go through customs because our check bag was on our previous flight. We explained that they can send the bag at a later date because we have to get home to our kids. Note there are over 25 other people they denied as well. Also, other airlines sent our check bag at a later date of flights were running late. Furthermore, Air Canada did book our hotel rooms but did not state when we had to check out. So at 11am the next day we received a phone call that we have to check out. Our flight wasn’t due to arrive until 920pm. What were we supposed to do from 11am to at least 7 pm. With no winter clothes because we are coming from Jamaica and we didn’t have our clothes due to the checked bag being on the previous plane. We called several Air Canada customer service lines and we met with excuses. I will never fly Air Canada or will recommend this airline. We were warned but decided to try them out anyway. Lastly, my wife checked for flights and they had a flight leaving Toronto at 11am the next day but Air Canada boomed is on the last flight leaving because it was more convenient for them.

256,256,"✅ Trip Verified |  Montreal to Tokyo. The welcoming staff at Montreal airport was unbelievably rude. The check-in machines were not working and there was only one desk open for the check-ins. One desk for the largest company in one of the most important airports in Canada, unbelievable. After 20 minutes of waiting without any improvement, people started asking the staff what was happening and we were just told; ""20 minutes is nothing, if you're still in line in 6 hours you can come talk to me again but before that, it's not my problem, get over it"". The rest of the check-in and management staff on the ground though were all very nice and accommodating after I have to say. The flight was a 13,5 hours to Tokyo in a Boeing 787. Plane was nice enough and all the cabin crew staff were very good and welcoming. I was not expecting much for the food but this went beyond anything I had. The chicken was white and dry and had a blend tomato sauce with it...I actually felt sick and disgusted after eating it. I don't know what the breakfast was supposed to be but I could not finish it. For an airline that considers itself the best in North America, they really really need to improve their game.

265,265,"Not Verified |  Brussels to Montreal. What an improvement over my last flight. This time, the food made all the difference. The vegetarian meal was excellent: full of flavour, quality ingredients and was an appropriate size. Red wine on board was delicious as well. I had decided to abandon Air Canada for international flights until I took this flight.

270,270,"Not Verified |  I have been flying Air Canada - Toronto-Delhi-Toronto for the last 3 years (Premium Economy and Business), at least once a year. The service has been good and bad i.e. not really consistent but nothing so bad that it would motivate me to take time out to write a review. However, this time when I was flying direct to New Delhi from Toronto on Oct 8th, AC042, 22.10 departure, I had some experiences worth noting. Once we settled in the air hostess came to take our dinner order (choice between veg and non-veg). Coincidentally, my husband and I were the last 2 people she got to in a section of 22 passengers. Her words were: Unfortunately you will have to get the vegetarian option as that’s the only option left. We got a little irritated by her choice of words as we have paid the same fare as every other passenger in that section. So if every other passenger has been given a choice, why shouldn’t we be. And we expressed this with the air hostess. She said: “I will bring someone else to talk to you about it.” She then comes back after having a chat with her colleagues and said they’ll see what they can do about the meal. I am vegetarian so I would have chosen that option anyway. But just the way she said it was quite unprofessional. Over the span of the rest of the 13 hour flight, she was quite unpleasant and unprofessional whenever she would be serving us. She came to our seats to get our meal trays back but no thank you or a smile. Courtesies like these are basic tenats of any customer-facing industry, let alone airlines or hospitality which is quite a competitive market. Additionally, I rang the call bell once during my entire flight, and it took the staff 20 minutes and multiple times switching off and on to grab one of their attention. Even though they were walking up and down the aisle a couple of time. Maybe Air Canada needs to invest in training their staff on how to provide the best customer service that they claim in their advertising. Overall, it was quite disappointing for the fare prices we paid.",Air Canada,"not verified | i have been flying air canada - toronto-delhi-toronto for the last 3 years (premium economy and business),

275,275,"Not Verified |  Toronto to New Delhi. I waited to purchase duty-free and was told that the it was impossible to do so as there are less than 2 hours left in the flight. I originally pushed the service button 1.5 hours prior to the duty-free closing and not one crew member came to my assistance. I then went and flagged down a crew member explaining the fact that I've been waiting for 1.5 hours to have someone bring me duty free. She then left and said that she would return in 15 mins. 15 mins later she came back notifying me that the flight had passed the 2-hour marker and was unable to provide duty-free.

276,276,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Toronto. I was travelling with 3 kids and my husband. My 2nd daughter got a bug bite. It is very common for her to get that. It was itchy and she was crying. The lady behind us told the flight attendant that she was hurt. The flight attendant called nurse on board and one nurse came and assisted her. Everything was okay. She didn’t get any medications and slept good. Before reaching Toronto airport, I asked the flight attendant, do we have any procedures to do because of the bug bite? She said, just give your address and she was the one who was doing everything. But, when we went to the gate for boarding to Regina, they said, we are not allowed to travel until we get approval from med- assistant. They send us to the customer service. It was very hard for us because I had to travel with 3 kids and walk all the way to customer service. They all were tired of 2 days of travel. I didn’t get good experience from the person at the customer service. We missed our flight to Regina. We called med- assistant.

At Rome airport, Air Canada provides access for business class passengers travelling to the Casa Italia (Air Italia) lounge which was a memorable experience with all the Italian flair one experiences in Italy with food wine and hospitality.

This was excellent news as I was making a connection at Trudeau Airport for another flight to my home. The food and wine were excellent on the flight and the staff were friendly and provided service when needed. I also really liked the selection of films on the IFE as I am travelling on quite a few Air Canada flights this fall and I appreciated that there are still more films I look forward to seeing.

The flight attendant was appalled that the checking agent forced us to check our bags and she did everything that she could to get our bags up to the main cabin (she was the only competent person that we encountered and deserves a raise).

299,299,"✅ Trip Verified | Booked airline tickets in April 2019 with Air Canada from Vancouver, Canada to Cancun Mexico on their regular airline. And once again, received notice this August, my flight there and back has been changed to Air Canada Rouge (new flight numbers, different aircraft, changed time departures). I have phoned Air Canada and asked to speak to a supervisor and requested to be seated in ""preferred seating"" at no addition cost as compensation for being ""downgraded"" but they refused my request.

However, 10 days before our departure day (7/12), I received an email letting me know that my flight schedule had changed. After speaking with a representative I was informed that Air Canada had terminated the Toronto to Delhi route and that I would have to be placed on different flights in order for me to reach my destination at the dates I had initially selected. After a few back and forths, I was able to be placed on a two layover journey to India, with the following route: 7/21: DC-Montreal-Munich-Delhi, 8/5: Delhi-Vancouver-Toronto-DC. As a result of this change, my initial one layover ~18h trip turned into a two layover ~26h voyage. Additionally, when booking my trip, I was asked to select and pay for my seats, as the seats were not free of charge. Once I had boarded, I realized that I had not been assigned to the seats I purchased. I contacted Air Canada about this but never received a reply.

329,329,"Not Verified |  I had an awful experience with Air Canada on my recent trip to Europe. Every single flight on my trip was delayed, but that was the least of my worries. On my way there, my bag was lost. I was unable to contact anyone who could give me any information as to where it was. When I received it nearly 3 days later it was severely damaged. On the way home I had even more troubles. Due to substantial delays, I missed my connecting flight in Montreal and had to stay there for an extra day before I could get another flight home. I was denied any compensation for a hotel room, cab fare, or food while I was stuck unexpectedly in Montreal for an extra day. They gave me a phone number to call to get a hotel room at a ""discounted rate"". However when I finally got through, I was told there were no more discounted rates left and the best they could offer me was a $300 room at the Marriott. No thanks. I booked my own hotel room for half the price on Expedia instead. When I finally got home the next day do you think my bag made it home too? Of course not! Once again it was delayed and further damaged. I have also been denied my claim for a refund of baggage fees, so I guess I paid $60+ each way for the privilege of having my bag lost and destroyed. It has been impossible to get ahold of an actual person to talk to about this nightmare of a trip, and all of my online claims have been denied. I have received $0 in compensation for any of this, even though I spent hundreds of extra dollars as a result of Air Canada's incompetence. My friends who were also flying Air Canada (different flights) to attend the same wedding all had similar troubles as well. This is not an isolated incident.

As the aircraft was to come from Halifax, some 2 hours away, someone should have told the computer to send me a message telling me that. This is where Air Canada customer handling came to the fore – come back at 20.30 and we will get you on that flight. I explained I had 3 more connections that day.

After we boarded, and put her in her car seat, she fell right asleep as people were still boarding.  At this point the crew said the car seat needed to be checked as their seatbelts don’t work with car seats, and I had to hold her. They also said there were no seats in coach for her and that they need me to get her now so that they could take off. They were polite, but I was stunned by what I was being told.  We complied with their instructions, as required. Air Canada responded to my email offering me a $100 e-gift card. All of us were exhausted after the flight.

I have seldom, if ever, had a more attentive crew. Between meal services, there was always at least one attendant patroling the cabin eager to serve.

But when I went to check in I was told there was no such flight or booking under that number. So then they wanted to send me to Toronto then El Salvador for the night, I wasn’t happy with that so they sent me to Miami then Belize. So instead of me getting to Belize on the 28th I finally got there on the 30th. Up until getting to Miami, I hadn’t slept for some 30+ hours.

372,372,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Hong Kong. A trip riddled with personal hiccups, but Air Canada managed to make it feel better. I was running a little late for my flight and in the heat of it all, left one of my carry-ons at a security checkpoint for domestic departures. While I wasn’t able to get the item back the ground staff and cabin crew went above and beyond their fall of duty in helping me get it back. It didn’t work out in the end, but I appreciate the effort from contact numbers to the flight attendant that literally stepped off the plane to help me look. They really didn’t have to, but I am very thankful for their efforts. As for the premium economy cabin itself, it’s very small, comprising of 3 rows, totalling 24 seats. They’re significantly wider than economy seats and closely resemble the regional business class product. The seats were comfortable and I managed to catch 6 hours of sleep on a 14 hour flight, but they a cosmetic refresh may be due, with slightly warped armrests and scratched glossy plastic seatbacks negatively impacting the aesthetics. IFE was touchscreen and remote controlled, though the touchscreen functions were somewhat unwieldy compared to economy class TVs. Food was above average, with a premium (though not business class worthy) first meal with proper porcelain and metal cutlery, followed by what seemed to be a standard economy class meal (I believe Cathay Pacific also does the same thing). They also have a chicken pesto ciabatta as a snack prior to landing and that was good too, chicken was tender and well seasoned. I would also note that typical of a North American airline, Air Canada does offer good coffee (Lavazza) even in regular economy, so that’s a plus. Overall, Air Canada has drastically improved their long haul product over the years, while maintaining fairly reasonable fares for international flights. As a full service airline, flying to Hong Kong, their most comparable competitor for the route is Cathay Pacific, of whom I have referenced regularly. Given a choice between the two, I would pick Air Canada for value, and surprisingly, food as well- they’re generally much cheaper and there seems to be better attention to detail with regards to food and beverage. On the other hand Cathay is still able to offer more convenient time slots and premium economy in their flights includes 3 checked bags, though typically at a significantly higher price, so who you do fly with definitely depends on your needs, but Air Canada is definitely a viable option to get you there.",Air Canada,"✅ trip verified | vancouver to hong kong. a trip riddled with personal hiccups,

Only thing is the food could improve. The meal service is not that generous compared to other full service carriers. I ordered an Asian Vegetarian meal which is ideally Indian and they gave some Aloo gobi (an Indian dish of cooked potatoes and cauliflower) and rice, which is not really a good combination. On top of that it was with sweet potato make it taste even worse. The light snack service of a muffin was filling before landing. IFE was decent.

392,392,"✅ Trip Verified |  Edmonton to Charlotte via Toronto. It started with the grounding of the 737 Max 8 which lead to the first cancellation of my flights on March 15. This is understandable. I went online and changed all of my flights and my wife's flights and lost a day of travel but had everything sorted. I was now due to depart on the 16th. I got a call on the 15th from an agent saying my new flight was cancelled due to a schedule change. I questioned the reason ""schedule change"" as the agent didn't realize my wife was on the same plane and my wife's ticket was still good.  Everything got rebooked to have us routed through Vancouver and then overnighting now in Toronto and arriving the following day in Charlotte. When I arrived in Vancouver I got a text that my plane to Toronto was cancelled and I wasn't departing Vancouver until 11:55pm to Toronto with a 1 hour gap between my arrival and the flight to Charlotte. This was a problem as my luggage was all tagged to Toronto as I was supposed to be getting off and collecting my bags. I went to luggage services and arranged for the bags to all be redirected to Charlotte. I was assured this happened. When I arrived in Toronto I was met with the news that 2 out of 3 of my bags were not located. They almost did not let me board to the US with missing luggage but we finally got through with 4 minutes to spare and a very long run across the airport. I had to purchase new clothes as my bags were missing for three days. I finally got my bags but had to keep calling them to check on them and had to report the issue three different times as they failed to file a proper file number. I was never given the file number and I am now struggling to claim these charges. Due to the three flight cancellations I incurred charges for two missed hotel stays that couldn't be cancelled. We had a great time in Charlotte and on the last day I checked in online for my flight and it said to arrive at the airport 3 hours early for the international flight so we did. When we arrived at the airport there is only one Air Canada counter and there were no staff present to check our bags. We waited for 45 minutes after having the airport page them for someone to show up. When the agent finally showed up and we questioned why we have to be here three hours before our flight but she wasn't here, her response was ""My schedule says I start at 9 take it up with my boss"". There is a sign on the counter that says an agent will only be present 3 hours before flight departure times which clearly was not the case. I emailed air Canada customer service twice regarding these issues and the first response was a generic canned response addressing the grounding of the Max 8 737, which did not address my concerns.

I originally asked for someone to call me which has still not happened and I have written a reply to their email which they have not responded to.

398,398,"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Samana. After booking my honeymoon at a 5 star resort through air Canada vacations we proceeded to spend 48 hours in different Canadian airports with zero support, compensation or even apologies from the airline. Not only were we stranded on the first night of our marriage but when we were told in Edmonton that we would be taken care of for room and board in Montreal, where we were to wait until the following evening to fly, we were informed after landing that they hadn't arranged for enough rooms. As a result, my wife and I had to spend an additional 280$ on the only room left anywhere near the airport. As it was already very late at night we were only able to sleep for 5 hrs before we had to catch another plane backtracking to Toronto where we would continue our layover for another 10 hrs. The trip started at 7am on a Saturday and we ended up arriving in Dominican monday morning. After many attempts to talk to phone representatives, as suggested by all the management at the airports, we were able to convince them to leave us with 30$ food vouchers for 2 people and 48 hrs of travel! Anyone you talk to in this company has their hands tied and is very willing to hand you off to another person or direct you to another phone number where you wait on hold, once for 2.5 hrs, only to be redirected elsewhere so on and so forth.

413,413,"✅ Trip Verified |  Columbus to Keflavik via Toronto. I've flown with Air Canada on this route twice. Once in 2017, and one scheduled for June 2019. The 2017 experience left me sour on Air Canada but I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt because, hey, stuff happens. I haven't even taken my flight yet in 2019 and I can tell you my 2017 experience was no fluke. Everything that has happened thus far points to a company that lacks organization and is terrible under crisis and doesn't know how to deal with anything that may not go exactly according to plan. I booked my flight in January 2019 and I've had 6 e-mails already about my flight being rescheduled and there being itinerary changes. I have never in my life experienced this much dysfunction when dealing with an airline. If everything goes smoothly, I'm sure you'll have a fine flight, but it's when things go awry that you hope an airline would know what they're doing, and in my experience, Air Canada just doesn't. There are other airlines that will charge $100 more for the same flight. It's worth it, if for no other reason than the peace of mind to know that if something goes wrong, things will have some modicum of organization and a plan.",Air Canada,"✅ trip verified | columbus to keflavik via toronto. i've flown with air canada on this route twice. once in 2017, and one scheduled for june 2019. the 2017 experience left me sour on air canada but i thought i would give them the benefit of the doubt because, hey, stuff happens. i haven't even taken my flight yet in 2019 and i can tell you my 2017 experience was no fluke. everything that has happened thus far points to a company that lacks organization and is terrible under crisis and doesn't know how to deal with anything that may not go exactly according to plan. i booked my flight in january 2019 and i've had 6 e-mails already about my flight being rescheduled and there being itinerary changes. i have never in my life experienced this much dysfunction when dealing with an airline. if everything goes smoothly, i'm sure you'll have a fine flight, but it's when things go awry that you hope an airline would know what they're doing, and in my experience, air canada just doesn't. there are other airlines that will charge $100 more for the same flight. it's worth it, if for no other reason than the peace of mind to know that if something goes wrong, things will have some modicum of organization and a plan.", Trip Verified |  Columbus to Keflavik via Toronto Ive flown with Air Canada on this route twice Once in 2017 and one scheduled for June 2019 The 2017 experience left me sour on Air Canada but I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt because hey stuff happens I havent even taken my flight yet in 2019 and I can tell you my 2017 experience was no fluke Everything that has happened thus far points to a company that lacks organization and is terrible under crisis and doesnt know how to deal with anything that may not go exactly according to plan I booked my flight in January 2019 and Ive had 6 emails already about my flight being rescheduled and there being itinerary changes I have never in my life experienced this much dysfunction when dealing with an airline If everything goes smoothly Im sure youll have a fine flight but its when things go awry that you hope an airline would know what theyre doing and in my experience Air Canada just doesnt There are other airlines that will charge 100 more for the same flight Its worth it if for no other reason than the peace of mind to know that if something goes wrong things will have some modicum of organization and a plan, Trip Verified |  Columbus to Keflavik via Toronto Ive flown with Air Canada on this route twice Once in 2017 and one scheduled for June 2019 The 2017 experience left me sour on Air Canada but I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt because hey stuff happens I havent even taken my flight yet in 2019 and I can tell you my 2017 experience was no fluke Everything that has happened thus far points to a company that lacks organization and is terrible under crisis and doesnt know how to deal with anything that may not go exactly according to plan I booked my flight in January 2019 and Ive had 6 emails already about my flight being rescheduled and there being itinerary changes I have never in my life experienced this much dysfunction when dealing with an airline If everything goes smoothly Im sure youll have a fine flight but its when things go awry that you hope an airline would know what theyre doing and in my experience Air Canada just doesnt There are other airlines that will charge 100 more for the same flight Its worth it if for no other reason than the peace of mind to know that if something goes wrong things will have some modicum of organization and a plan,Trip Verified | Columbus Keflavik via Toronto Ive flown Air Canada route twice Once 2017 one scheduled June 2019 The 2017 experience left sour Air Canada I thought I would give benefit doubt hey stuff happens I havent even taken flight yet 2019 I tell 2017 experience fluke Everything happened thus far points company lacks organization terrible crisis doesnt know deal anything may go exactly according plan I booked flight January 2019 Ive 6 emails already flight rescheduled itinerary changes I never life experienced much dysfunction dealing airline If everything goes smoothly Im sure youll fine flight things go awry hope airline would know theyre experience Air Canada doesnt There airlines charge 100 flight Its worth reason peace mind know something goes wrong things modicum organization plan

415,415,"✅ Trip Verified | Terrible! Take any other airline. I fly anywhere between 8-12 time’s per year, and when I fly Air Canada I consistently regret booking my flight with their airline. Firstly, their email and real-time updating on multiple of my flights has been inefficient. Our return flight was delayed by 2 hours and they sent an email to update on this information an hour before the flight departure. By this time we are already in line to go through security. We discovered that the cause for delay was because the flight crew had a mandatory rest time of 8hrs (and their previous flight had been late the night before) this means that the information on the flight delay had been known by Air Canada for at least 8 hours prior to the scheduled flight and they informed passengers only one hour before flight departure. In addition, our first flight to our vacation destination was also delayed and we received no updates on this until siting at the gate wondering why our flight hadn’t started boarding yet. To make matters worse, they did not prove to meet their revised departure time. We actually took off even later than the revised departure time. In both circumstances the email to update was not sent at a time that would allow us to make other plans to accommodate their lack of integrity. Secondly, I was not happy with the service on the aircraft. The stewardesses seem to have a lack of communication between their fellow employees. As they collected garbage I handed the stewardess a disposable coffee cup that had been used as a make shift garbage bin (full of banana peel and other garbage) she took the cup from me, then instead of throwing it away she proceeded to hand the cup back to me and said I will come back for liquids, and turned before I could explain there was no liquid in the cup. I felt uncomfortable because I was in the middle seat and this whole scenario happened while passing garbage back and forth in front of the passenger next to me (a stranger). To add further frustration, the stewardess did not return to take the garbage. When a different stuardess passed by I asked her to please take my garbage she responded in a rude tone “we already collected garbage”, I explained that the previous stewardess said she would return and had not, her reply was “I’ll come back then” She did end up coming back for the garbage, greeting me with “your garbage?” And then aggressively snatched the cup from my hand and stormed away. I felt humiliated and disrespected. This disappointing service has been consistent on multiple Air Canada flights, so often that I have come to expect this kind of service when I fly Air Canada. I have finally learned that flying Air Canada is not worth the frustration, confusion, and disrespect I encounter and will no longer consider flying with Air Canada in the future. I believe that there are much more details and events that Air Canada should be aware of if they are serious about improving their service.

Due to weather our departing flight was cancelled (understandably). The customer service from that point on was by far the worst experience we have witnessed.

The email link they sent was vague and we ended up calling and being left on hold for over an hour. when we finally reached an agent they advised that we could be re booked within 7 days! As we had car, hotel and attractions pre paid we requested an insurance claim but were told we had to deal with another department for this item. Eventually we were re booked the following morning but were flown out on 2 separate flights. My wife and son were flown to catch a connecting flight to our final destination while I was left on standby with a strong possibility of catching an afternoon flight. In total our 3 hr flights originally booked turned out to be a total of 30 hrs in travel time. While re booking I suggested other flights with air canada that were still posted as available on their website but they refused to allow us on these flights as they were a premium flight and not covered in their rebooking policy. All in all we missed our car rental (another long story) accrued extra hotel costs, additional car rental fees, and pretty much destroyed our holiday plans. To top everything off they lost our luggage on our return trip which thankfully arrived 2 days after we got home.

up calling and being left on hold for over an hour when we finally reached an agent they advised that we could be re booked within 7 days As we had car hotel and attractions pre paid we requested an insurance claim but were told we had to deal with another department for this item Eventually we were re booked the following morning but were flown out on 2 separate flights My wife and son were flown to catch a connecting flight to our final destination while I was left on standby with a strong possibility of catching an afternoon flight In total our 3 hr flights originally booked turned out to be a total of 30 hrs in travel time While re booking I suggested other flights with air canada that were still posted as available on their website but they refused to allow us on these flights as they were a premium flight and not covered in their rebooking policy All in all we missed our car rental another long story accrued extra hotel costs additional car rental fees and pretty much destroyed our holiday plans To top everything off they lost our luggage on our return trip which thankfully arrived 2 days after we got home To be clear I dont blame the employees of this company as they are simply following the airlines rules I blame a very poor business plan and management structure that is obviously designed to capitalize on any change of plan We have had to submit a claim to our third party insurance company as neither the booking agency or air Canadas insurance will cover any of our additional costs,Not Verified |  Complete waste of time and money My Husband and I

431,431,"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Santa Clara. Flight was scheduled for 5.10 pm Jan 31, delayed until 8.30. They let everyone on the plane and sit there for almost 2 hours before advising flight was cancelled. - the attitude from customer service was appalling I tried to ask the manager a question and she literally was ignored. We were provided with a hotel room and shuttle for the night and promised breakfast and lunch but only given $7 voucher for a breakfast buffet being $26, we ended up eating protein bars until we could get to the lounge at the airport. Flight is delayed over an hour again, and we’re given $15 credit on boarding pass for food, good for one sandwich.

435,435,"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Amsterdam. Essentially, there was nothing wrong with this flight, but it was not great. If it wasn't for the fact they were offering a terrific deal on a direct flight, I would have paid a bit more to travel with a European based airline. The service on a full flight was stressed. Frazzled is not quite the right word, but slightly chaotic and slow is probably a good description. Flight attendants were there to do their job, nothing more. Food was ok, standard fare, but warm and cooked well. I chose pasta with a tomato-based sauce. The seats felt a bit too cramped for a 7hr+ flight. Not a great recline either. A positive of Air Canada is that the full bar is available in economy class, something that makes a long-haul flight a little more enjoyable. On the ground though, they were really helpful. For this trip, I travelled with my wheelchair bound daughter. Often, we've found, any communication of her special needs onboard is not relayed to the airport staff. In this case, the staff at YYZ were ready to help and made sure she was properly helped on and had all she needed in place.

I was suggested to notify the agent about my luggage the next day, which I did. They still lost my luggage. I received my luggage 3 days later with no apology or refund as the insurance suggested. I was given the last seat in the middle row right beside the washroom (despite allocating the seat and booking it 3 months in advance). This was after I had explained and requested my situation. I boarded the flight from Dubai and right after they declared a delay due to ""technical difficulties"". I was starving and willing to even pay for some food; there were no flight attendants to be seen in this time.

While at the gate in Saint Louis waiting to depart, the captain announced that the plane is off balance and he needs to do some adjustments, so he makes the announcement that all women must sit at the front of the plane and the men must go to the back of the plane (safety first, no problem). Meanwhile all of this meant that we were 45 min late to depart Saint Louis, later on during the flight the captain announced that he realized that some of us had connecting flights and put our minds at ease by saying that the connecting flights would wait for us. Our flight from Toronto was to departure at 10:10pm, after sprinting through the airport we got to the gate at 10:05pm, the girl at the gate told us that she was told to release the plane. We then complained to customer service and they said 'oh well its not our fault it was the weather', and then he says to us : 'you guys should of had time to get through customs and make it here on time' we're in our 30's and we are in good shape, there was no way that even an Olympic runner wouldn't of made it on time! we continued to argue that the captain wouldn't take off because of the weight issue. Customer service just kept saying ""its due to bad weather "" therefore, they wouldn't pay for hotel room.

When we arrived to Canada, we got two of our luggages right away and the other two we waited 1.5 hours for.

I am not going to be doing any travelling for the next year due to having surgery and work commitments.

445,445,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Geneva (with a stop in Montreal) on an A330 and returned to Toronto from London Heathrow on a Boeing 787-9. Air Canada has changed its economy class setup and now charges $60 each way to check in a suitcase on long-haul flights. This is by far my biggest gripe - one of the main reasons I choose to fly Air Canada is that the fare used to include all the essentials, unlike many of their competitors. Sadly, AC are starting to go down the nickle-and-diming route. Surely everybody who goes on a long transatlantic flight needs to check in a suitcase, so why not just include it in the airfare like before and spare everyone the hassle? This makes the online check-in process much longer and more cumbersome, as billing address and credit card info. all have to be entered as well as everything else. Very annoying and pesky. You also no longer get to choose a seat at the time of booking and instead have to wait to see what's available when checking in, though I wasn't too annoyed about that. Bag-drop at Toronto Pearson was fully self-service - I was even able to place the suitcase on the belt myself without any staff being present. The flight to Montreal and then on to Geneva was on time. Unlike on many newer aircraft, the older A330 has the advantage of having nice wide seats with excellent legroom and good seat cushioning. The IFE was okay but not quite as good in the newer cabins. Unfortunately I was seated in the middle of the aircraft by the washrooms, which was very bothersome on an overnight flight. The stopover in Montreal is a curious setup as I had to get off the plane, wait at the gate, and then get back on it into the same seat about 1.5 hours later. The cabin service was usual Air Canada - generous with the drinks, less so with the food. The pre-landing snack of a small slice of banana bread was inadequate. The return flight on the very new 787-9 was pleasant - the seats were not as narrow or as firm as I feared they might be. The IFE was better than on the older A330, though still not as good as some other airlines'. Cabin service was the usual - pleasant enough. On both flights, the captain and first officer stood with the cabin crew to say goodbye as passengers disembarked, which I thought was a very nice little touch. Arrival at Toronto Pearson airport was the usual complete disaster - we had to sit for over an hour until a gate opened up, and then they couldn't get the bridge to fit properly. And the usual pandemonium at the baggage reclaim, but none of this was AC's fault. Overall, perfectly pleasant flights and very glad that AC has finally got rid of their ancient 767s!

446,446,"✅ Trip Verified |  Puerto Vallarta to Vancouver. This was an excellent flight in a brand new 737Max. Upon boarding staff were cheerful and helpful. The seating was roomy and was in the front row window seat as it is easier to get in and out around the passenger beside me. The IFE has much larger screens and more selections than the other AC narrow body planes. I really appreciated that. The attendant serving us in the front cabin was attentive with the wine and beverage service. As I fly AC a lot I noticed that dinner service had fewer choices and it was not served as courses nor were there 2 linens on the tray. Given this was a flight to a beach destination and I bought the return ticket at a very reasonable price, I can understand you would not get the same level of meal services I experience when traveling to Toronto, Montreal or Europe. One disappointment is the size of the forward rest room...thankfully I am a tall slim person. It would feel very cramped for some others. Also missing was the hand and face lotion that one typically finds in business class. This I missed as the air is so dry. I would appreciate it if AC would add that to the business class rest rooms on the 737Max. Check in was smooth and well organized. There is no lounge at PVR for front cabin passengers.

fly AC a lot I noticed that dinner service had fewer choices and it was not served as courses nor were there 2 linens on the tray Given this was a flight to a beach destination and I bought the return ticket at a very reasonable price I can understand you would not get the same level of meal services I experience when traveling to Toronto Montreal or Europe One disappointment is the size of the forward rest roomthankfully I am a tall slim person It would feel very cramped for some others Also missing was the hand and face lotion that one typically finds in business class This I missed as the

448,448,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Toronto. No food provided, not even a pretzel! Extra charges for every piece of luggage checked in. All 3 flight during my one week vacation were delayed (4 hours the first one) The planes don't have enough in-cabin space to accommodate traveler's belongings. I had to check in my carry-on in the end. Service was about the worst I have ever experienced. Service was interrupted at one occasion due to turbulence, I asked for a coffee but since they could not serve hot beverages during that moment the flight attendant gave me an empty cup so that I can claim my coffee when the seat belt sign went off. Waited an hour for them to come see me (that little light to call assistance is useless on that flight because they ignore you). Once she came back, took my cup and that was the end of it.

449,449,"✅ Trip Verified |  St. John's to Boston via Halifax. The original flight out of St John's left 1.5 hours after scheduled departure although the status was not delayed and we boarded reasonably on time. Landed in Halifax and got back onto the same plane to go to Boston after clearing US customs. Got to Boston and my bag had not made it out of Halifax although both of my husband's bags made it. We filed a delayed baggage report with the Air Canada baggage office in Boston on 1 Jan 2019 - same day as our flight. We flew on to Las Vegas and were informed that the bag would be routed to us within 2 days. It is now day 4 on the 4 Jan 2019 and we still have no bag. We have spoken to at least ten different people on the phone number provided for Air Canada delayed baggage. Turns out we are dealing with a call centre where there are no clear lines of communication as we have now been told about five different versions of where my bag is. We decided to get in a cab and go to Las Vegas airport to see if we could find out more information. Air Canada have a shared baggage office managed by a different company. They told us the bag was no in Toronto and most definitely not arrived in Vegas on 3 Jan 2019 when it was supposed to reach us. We called the delayed baggage number again and actually ended up giving the phone to one of the staff at the office because the guy on the phone was adamant our bag arrived in Vegas - turns out he was wrong. We are due to fly home to Australia on 4 Jan 2019 so gave numerous instructions to now get the bag to our home address - we verified that this information was on my file reference on the World Tracer website - great we can see the information on there, my bag might get home! Oh wait we just called Air Canada delayed baggage hotline and have been informed it is now going back to Boston from Toronto and is not scheduled further than that. Now we have already told these people numerous times we don't live in Boston. So after giving clear instructions again for at least the fifth time that the bag needs to now get to Australia, we are still in limbo. It is impossible to actually speak to someone directly at Air Canada because they have made themselves fantastic at being unreachable - no email addresses or phone contact numbers. The delayed baggage call centre cannot communicate accurate information and don't know anything but those are the only people you can speak to. We fly regularly every year and have used many different airlines. Never have I experienced anything like this. The customer service and assistance at Air Canada is absolutely appalling and I am astounded that an airline can operate like this. By the way Air Canada, I am still waiting for my bag.

467,467,"✅ Trip Verified | This is my fourth or fifth trip with Air Canada and I have nothing but good things to say about my experiences. The terminal used for Canadian domestic flights at Vancouver is quite dated, but plenty of options for eating and drinking while waiting for the flight. Volunteers were requested to check carry-on bags (something I always count on happening, as my carry on tends to be quite heavy, always a treat). Boarding was expeditious considering the size of the aircraft, and we were soon on our way. Food and beverage service was an average pace and quality. Buy on board options were quite pricey, so I abstained. On their newer aircraft, AC's inflight entertainment is some of the best in the industry. Arrival into Toronto was early and the flight time overall was one hour quicker than scheduled! Connection in Toronto is always such a breeze, and USA pre-clearance in Toronto means you arrive into the USA without a need for passport control. Toronto to Boston was a standard North American flight of fine quality. Air Canada's gates in Boston are right next to baggage claim and the exit. Regarding money matters, I paid $173 one-way for this trip, which is quite reasonable for transcontinental journey.

Afterwards it was brought to our knowledge that the flight was overbooked, which may be the reason for us giving up our seats on the original flight.

They called me two times, lying me because they actually didn't know where my luggage was. I had to argue with the customer service to be delivered at my place out of work schedule. I filled the form to get a compensation but they suggested me 15% off for 4 tickets. I usually travel alone.

But the plane was operated by Air Canada, and we were told to drop our bags off at the Air Canada counter.

482,482,✅ Trip Verified |  My original flight would have taken me from Dallas to Montreal to Vancouver to Melbourne. My problems started when I was not allowed to place my bag into an overhead compartment on my first flight leaving from Dallas because of a lack of available space. After checking my bag at the gate and boarding the plane I observed a flight attendant access her belongings which had been conveniently placed in an overhead compartment inside the passenger area of the aircraft. My next flight leaving Montreal was delayed 90 minutes due to engine problems which forced me to miss my connection in Vancouver. I was then rebooked on a flight to Sydney which was delayed for 60 minutes. When boarding the plane in Vancouver I noticed I had not been placed in a seat with upgraded leg room which I had paid for months before. When I inquired as to why I was not in a seat with more legroom I was told the flight was full and there was nothing that could be done. Upon arriving in Sydney I was met by an employee who advised I would be unable to make my connection flight from Sydney to Melbourne and handed a new ticket for a different flight. While in Sydney I found out that my luggage was still in Vancouver. I did not receive my luggage for 48 hours. After boarding my first flight leaving Melbourne there was a power issue forcing us to be grounded for just over an hour. This caused me to again miss my connection in Vancouver and Air Canada wanted to rebook myself and other passengers on another Air Canada flight. The problem with that was our original flight was from Vancouver to Dallas and they now wanted to rebook us on other non direct flights. After voicing my concerns I was booked onto an American Airlines flight in order to fly directly from Vancouver back to Dallas. Upon returning to Dallas I was again informed that my luggage did not make it to the new plane and was still in Vancouver. I filed a complaint online on November 18th after all the problems arrived getting to Australia. I contacted customer service since customer relations does not have a phone number on November 22 to check on the status of my complaint. I was informed by customer service that there was no way for me to speak with someone over the phone in customer relations and my complaint could take up to 40 days to be investigated.

483,483,"✅ Trip Verified |  Detroit to Rome via Toronto / Montreal. Transatlantic trip made by three segments. All flights pretty much on time, with easy boarding processes. DTW YYZ is a regional jet, hence, other than light refreshments and a squeezed seat, nothing much is to expected. Transit within AC’s T1 at YYZ was easy and smooth. YYZ YUL on 320 with PTVs (although the audio jack was not working at all). First time going through YUL and I expected to be much larger than that, probably on the same scale as YYZ. Easy boarding in Premium Economy (priority lane) makes settling in easy. Premium Economy seating is better than competitors (LH) with larger recline. Overall very satisfied. Good value for the money, as I bought a DTW FCO ticket for $ 560.00 and then paid $ 295.00 each way for the PE upgrade through bidding: I could have paid additional $ 600.00 each way and flown business.

488,488,"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to New York. My flight was delayed and ultimately cancelled due to aground stop issues because of weather concerns. Obviously the weather delays are outside of Air Canada's control; however after waiting on the aircraft for several hours, we finally reached the delayed departure time when the ground stop was lifted and we should have been able to take off. It wasn't until this point that we were informed that the crew would go over their time limit if they continued this trip and that instead of heading to LGA we had to wait for a new crew. This is unexcusable as we had known about the ground stop for hours and Air Canada should have had the foresight to address this issue and switch the crew while we were waiting for the weather delay anyway. While waiting for the crew to switch we miss our window of opportunity as a new weather-related ground stop was issued and the flight was ultimately cancelled (meanwhile other airlines and aircraft had departed and made it to LGA during this time, as we should have). To add insult to injury, when Air Canada rescheduled my itinerary, they placed me on a new flight that was scheduled to depart YYZ on the 17th to make up for my cancelled flight that was supposed to leave on the 15th. However they did not rebook my originally scheduled return flight on the 16th so that my new itinerary scheduled a return flight before I even departed for my destination. When I first contacted Air Canada to correct this obvious problem, I was almost charged a rebooking fee to reschedule my return flight.
