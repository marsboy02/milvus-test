Set in the present day, it is a modern adaptation of Prisoner Cell Block H that contemporises legendary characters and their stories for today's audience. This series takes the viewer inside to an uncompromising environment that explores the politics of women in a world without men, and how such a threatening experience both challenges and often changes those confined and working behind the razor wire. The audience will be introduced to Bea all over again and meet her allies and enemies in the form of iconic inmates: Doreen Anderson, Liz Birdsworth and Franky Doyle, and there are new faces such as Jacs Holt, the ruthless matriarch of a crime family who now reigns over Wentworth.

The Founder,508,United States,"1954. Having worked as a salesman most of his adult life, Ray Kroc has been a hustler in most senses of the word. That hustling has made him the target of derision among certain circles for peddling what have ended up being more novelty or faddish than useful products, but it has also placed more than a comfortable roof in Arlington Heights, Illinois over his and his wife Ethel's heads. Ethel, however, wishes that he placed as much effort into being at home with her than he is in selling, his current job of peddling five-spindle milkshake makers for Prince Castle which has him constantly on the road going from one drive-in restaurant to another. It is because of the beefs he has with the whole drive-in experience (bad food, bad service) in constantly eating at such establishments while on the road that he becomes enthralled with the concept of McDonald's Restaurant in San Bernardino, California, it owned and operated by brothers Richard McDonald and Maurice McDonald - Dick and Mac. Unlike most of Ray's customers who will only require one five-spindle milkshake maker at any given time, the McDonald brothers end up purchasing eight machines for their single restaurant. Primarily on Dick's initiative, the brothers have redesigned the whole concept of the drive-in restaurant to focus on quality food through a smaller menu of only the most popular items (hamburgers, fries, sodas), consistency in product so that customers know what to expect from time to time, change in the target market from lounging teenagers to families, and perhaps most importantly speed in having any order ready within seconds, many of these goals achievable through assembly line styled production. They had tried franchising previously, but failed in that they lost control over many of those aspects which made their San Bernardino restaurant successful. Despite believing Ray a bit off kilter (in other words, crazy), the McDonald brothers somewhat hesitantly enter into a contract with him to be their head of franchising. Ray's experience in the job is not without its problems, especially as his franchisees seem to be making more money than he is, he who is only breaking even. He is not averse to advancing ideas provided to him to get ahead - original ideas which are not his forte - he seeing the brothers as his biggest problem in they thinking small. These differences lead to a standoff between Ray and the brothers, the former who has a different goal for ""his"" business in profit and stoking his own ego seemingly his main priorities. —Huggo",7.2

Jeopardy!,"1,208",United States,"On the heels of the syndicated success of ""Wheel of Fortune (1983)"", producer Merv Griffin decided to return his classic quiz show-with-a-twist, ""Jeopardy!"" to the airwaves in 1984. It, too, was a huge success, and also marked a return to the game's tried-and-true formula of answers and questions (after a slightly-modified remake six years earlier failed to catch on). Three contestants, including a returning champion, competed. Six categories are announced (e.g., Art World, Cooking, 20th Century Republicans, ""Friends (1994)"", Muscle Men and College Girls Wearing White T-shirts), each having five answers ostensibly graded by difficulty, from $100 to $500. The champion chose a category and dollar amount (e.g., ""College Girls Wearing White T-shirts for $100""), to which host Trebek reads the answer (""Inspector 12 must give her seal of approval before a college girl can wear one of these plain white T-shirts""). Contestants had to respond in question form (""What is Hanes?"") ; if correct, they won the value of the question; if he/she was incorrect, failed to answer in time or phrase in the form of a question, that amount was deducted (hence, the dollar amount was ""always in jeopardy"") and his/her opponents could answer; having enough incorrect answers often led to negative scores. Thereafter, the contestant providing the last correct question selected next, and the process repeated; some answers made use of audio and/or video clues. Hidden behind one of the answers was a ""Daily Double"" space, with the contestant selecting that space able to wager up to all his/her current winnings or up to $500 if he/she had less) on the answer. After all 30 answers have been revealed (or sometimes, an undefined time limit expired), the game moved into ""Double Jeopardy!"" Gameplay was the same in ""Double Jeopardy!"" except six new categories were announced and the answers had values of $200 to $1,000 and two ""Daily Double"" spaces were hidden (with contestants able to wager up to $1,000 if they had less). At the end of the ""Double Jeopardy!"" round, all contestants with at least $1 were eligible to play ""Final Jeopardy!""; however, anyone with $0 or a negative score was disqualified from further play. Trebek announced a category, and the contestants (before seeing the answer) wagered up to everything they had on their ability to answer. Contestants had 30 seconds to write what they believed was the correct question. Those who were correct had the amount they wagered added to their winnings; however, any incorrect questions or failing to phrase properly lost what they wagered. The contestant with the most cash was champion, kept his/her winnings and got to return the next day. Champions competed until they won five shows (at which point they retired undefeated and, starting in 1997, also won a new car) or until they were defeated. All five-time champions and other high-scoring contestants over a period of time participated in a Tournament of Champions, the winner earning an additional $100,000; there were also teen, college, senior and international tournaments and celebrity shows conducted (the winners of the non-celebrity tournaments also earned a spot in the Tournament of Champions). In the fall of 2001, several changes were made, including the use of a ""Clue Crew"" (new regulars illustrating answers in selected categories by going ""on location""), and an increase in the dollar values of the answers (from $200 to $1,000 in Jeopardy! and $400 to $2,000 in Double Jeopardy!) ; another running change through the years was the addition of ""celebrity guests"" reading certain answers. None of the changes altered the basic game play, however. —Brian Rathjen <briguy_52732@yahoo.com>",8.2

After to learn horrified how Maider is shaved in her head to bald and severely tortured in her body looking for the Satan's seal (a supposedly secret and invisible mark left in the body of a witch that it leaves this part of her body insensitive to any pain), a scary Ana convinces to the rest for inventing all the Sabbat for Rostegui, explaining it as long as be possible, hoping that their fathers comeback in a week during the full moon tide.

Associate Director Mark Felt, a dedicated, loyal and meticulous employee of the Bureau for thirty years, and his wife Audrey, feel he being passed over for the job is a major snub, they who have sacrificed their own personal lives for the Bureau. Part of that sacrifice is not being able to devote time in locating the Felts' daughter, Joan Felt, who they have not heard from in a year, they only assuming that she going off their radar being on her own volition in her anti-establishment ideals. Felt not getting the job is arguably due to he being such an integral figure in the controversial Hoover tenure. One of the first cases for the Bureau in Gray's tenure is a break-in at and bugging of the Democratic National Committee offices, the case unofficially called Watergate for the complex in which the break-in occurred. Ordered by Gray by what what seems to be unofficial orders passed down from the White House, FBI staff are hamstrung in their investigation, Watergate which has seeming ties to the Committee for the Re-Election of the President and thus possibly the Republican administration in the White House. For the first time in his career, Felt decides to go rogue in an effort for the FBI to gain back its independence without interference by any other organization, including especially the White House.

Mindhorn,"1,947",United Kingdom,"Richard Thorncroft is a has-been British television actor who used to be famous in the late 1980s for playing the charismatic title character in the Isle of Man detective show Mindhorn, a character with a robotic eye that can literally ""see the truth"". Unfortunately, after becoming a little too pompous and arrogant, Richard ends up insulting the Isle of Man and his fellow cast members on the Wogan chat-show, including his on-screen and real-life love interest Patricia Deville (Essie Davies), his stuntman (Simon Farnaby), and bit-part co-star Peter Easterman (Steve Coogan). He decides to leave to try and make it big in Hollywood, but twenty-five years later he's balding in a flat in North London and has recently been replaced for an orthopaedic sock advertisement by John Nettles, much to his chagrin. He is even more jealous that Easterman now fronts a long-running spin-off show which has far eclipsed the success of Mindhorn. Richard has an unexpected opportunity to reignite his career though when a delusional criminal calling himself ""The Kestrel"" (Russell Tovey) starts terrorizing the Isle of Man and, having an extremely unhealthy obsession with the show, demands to talk only to Mindhorn. Relishing a chance for publicity, Richard dons his turtleneck and robot eye, aggravates the police with his method acting, tries to rekindle his old romance with Patricia, and also attempts to sign a Mindhorn DVD deal with Eastman. With his 1980s political incorrectness, solo musical single, useless cyborg eyepatch, and cheesy one-liners, Mindhorn is here to bring an apocalypse of justice. It's truth time. —Edward Hunter",6.3

There's something about the bar that seems to set him off. He meanders through life still carrying that same old Game Boy, trying to fill a hole that can't be filled. So what happened to turn this innocent teenager into the sad, angry man that we see now? Boys (Jonas) is an engrossing mystery that will keep you guessing from the first minute to the last. As it moves back and forth between its two timelines, the film succeeds as both a sweet coming-of-age love story and a dark suspense thriller. As these two perfectly-told stories intertwine, it makes for a totally unique and truly special cinematic experience. -- Stephen K. Weisenreder",7.0

La trinchera infinita,"2,270",Spain,"The film starts in 1936. In a small and remote inland town of Andalusia (southern Spain), Higinio is a tailor and a town councilor who has recently got married to Rosa. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Higinio hides in his own house awaiting the right moment to escape with his wife. But he is caught in his attempt by his neighbor, Gonzalo, who blames Higinio for his brother's death and is looking for revenge. Captured by Franco's soldiers, Higinio is driven by truck, along with other opposition prisoners, to a nearby prison. But an unwitting distraction from one of the prisoners gives him a chance to escape. He runs across the town to his house where he is to remain hidden in a secret hole. In the meantime, Gonzalo pays Higinio's wife occasional visits in the belief that she knows his whereabouts. When the civil war comes to an end in 1939, Higinio learns from Rosa that there is a reward for capturing him as well as other insurgents. After one of her father-in-law's visit, Rosa and Higinio's father succeed in moving Higinio into the father's house. But, to their surprise, Higinio's father dies of natural causes and Rosa inherits and moves into her father-in-law's house with Higinio as the secret occupant. Rosa takes charge of her late father-in-law's sewing shop. But, with time, troubles increase: Rosa is raped by Rodrigo, a young Civil Guard and one of her regular customers. Higinio kills him and buries the body in Higinio's hiding place. A few months later Rosa tells Higinio that she's pregnant. Despite Higinio's opposition, and unsure of the paternity of the child, Rosa abandons Higinio for a few months to visit her sister in order to hide her pregnancy to the rest of the town. Alone in the house, Higinio surprises the local postman with his male lover after they break into his theoretically empty house which they intend to use as their love nest. The two of them befriend Higinio, and they promise to keep their mutual secrets. When, in 1945, World War II ends, Higinio's hopes for Allied forces defeating Franco's regime and freeing the country gradually vanish. He continues his seclusion for years to come, living with daily fear and paranoia. Jaime, Rosa's and (presumably) Higinio's son, is taught to say that he is Rosa's nephew and that his parents died when he was a baby. With the house turned into a big cell, Higinio and Rosa's relationship deteriorates due to decades of isolation, guilt and shame. In 1963, Jaime, having grown up up as an idealistic young man and, tired of a life of fear and terror, welcomes a friend home. The friend is wanted by Franco's police forces and Jaime introduces him to his father, who learns that there are many others like him in hiding. At the same time, Jaime confronts his parents about the life he has had and a determined Gonzalo keeps visiting Rosa's sewing shop, still tormented by his brother death, and obsessed with the idea of seeking revenge and kill Higinio at any cost. But then, in 1969, Higinio's life changes after he hears a special news on the radio. —Chockys",7.2

The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson,"2,392",Greece,"When Stonewall Veteran and beloved Greenwich Village personality Marsha P Johnson turned up dead shortly after Gay Pride in 1992, it was the latest in a series of murders, gay bashings, and ""mysterious"" deaths in the local gay community. Johnson is seen in footage at a political march shortly before this, at an action trying to draw attention to these hate crimes. Tragically, Johnson then becomes the next victim. Like the other suspicious deaths, Johnson's death is quickly dismissed as a ""suicide"", even though there is no evidence that Johnson was suicidal, and significant evidence that Johnson was harassed and stalked on that very night. Demonstrations are held to protest the lack of police investigation, but it is not until decades later that transgender crime advocate Victoria Cruz succeeds in getting some answers. Even after decades, many contemporaries of Johnson are still afraid to discuss on the record what happened to Johnson, the murders that took place in the Village in that era, the danger that follows many of the most marginalized in the community, and the threats that some still fear. Like the previous documentary on Marsha P Johnson, Pay it No Mind, this film relies on archival footage of the dead, letting the subjects speak for themselves. Footage of Johnson at political actions is included, though some might not notice Johnson at first at some of these actions and memorials, dressed down in jeans and a t-shirt, or jeans and a flannel shirt, with no wig. Stonewall veterans, AIDS activists, and early gender nonconforming and transgender activists are shown at these demonstrations, as well.

The Battered Bastards of Baseball,"2,623",United States,"The Battered Bastards of Baseball is one of baseball's last great, unheralded true stories. In 1973, Hollywood veteran Bing Russell (best known for playing Deputy Clem on ""Bonanza"") created the only independent baseball team in America at the time, the legendary Portland Mavericks. Bing operated without a Major League affiliation while playing in a city that was considered a wasteland for professional baseball. Tryouts for the Mavericks, which were open to the public, were filled with hopefuls who arrived in droves from every state in America, many of whom had been rejected by organized baseball. Skeptics agreed it would never work. But Bing's Mavericks generated unprecedented success: they shattered attendance records, signed Kurt Russell - Bing's son - as a player and team Vice President, produced the most successful batboy in baseball (filmmaker Todd Field), re-launched the controversial career of Jim Bouton, hired the first female general manager in Baseball, and inspired one of America's beloved bubblegums - Big League Chew. The Battered Bastards of Baseball is as much about the independent spirit as it is about baseball. The Mavericks' in your face attitude was contagious to fans, and during their short reign, they - and Bing Russell - basically held up their middle finger to the sports establishment and said we're playing this game on our terms, not yours. They were the real life Bad News Bears. —Anonymous",8.0

Heart disease, cancer and stroke are the country's three leading causes of death, even though billions are spent each year to ""battle"" these very conditions. Millions suffer from a host of other degenerative diseases. Could it be there's a single solution to all of these problems? A solution so comprehensive, but so utterly straightforward, that it's mind-boggling that more of us haven't taken it seriously?

There's Something in the Water,"3,705",Canada,"Elliot Page and Gaycation collaborator Ian Daniel shift gears with the documentary There's Something in the Water, a disturbing and, frankly, terrifying portrait of ecological and social disasters in Page's native Nova Scotia. Based on Ingrid Waldron's incendiary study, the film follows Page as she travels to rural areas of the province that are plagued by toxic fallout from industrial development. As did Waldron, the filmmakers discover that these catastrophes have been precisely placed, all in remote, low income - and very often Indigenous or Black - communities. As the filmmakers observe, your postal code determines your health. We're introduced to many courageous women. Louise, from Shelburne, gives us a tour of a neighborhood in her hometown where every house has been affected by cancer. Michele fights to protect ""A?se?k"", or Boat Harbour, once a sanctuary for Indigenous people, now plagued by toxins spewed by a pulp and paper mill. The government only began addressing this when other whiter, wealthier communities were affected. (In one stomach-churning moment, it's explained that the company went to great effort to divert the offal towards ""A?se?k"".) And a group of ""Mi?gmaq"" activists known as The Grandmothers fight to protect a river threatened by a gas company. All of it is deeply sobering and scary, but like Page and Daniel we may find solace in the bravery of their subjects, who are the kind of resourceful and compassionate people you should place your bets on. If, as Louise poignantly asks, you don't care about other people, ""What do you get up for every day?"" —Toronto International Film Festival",6.6

In addition, Hugh Anderson, with who Karen has a turbulent history (the two who were once engaged before she ran off), who Pete treated like a son, and who had long helped Pete maintain the ranch, has a proverbial ""back of the envelope"" written, albeit undated, agreement from Pete for half the ranch, which Karen, in her turbulent relationship with Hugh, intends to fight. Meanwhile, Juliet, beyond striking up a friendship with Nan, the daughter of the stable owners down the road, has made a connection to one thing in rural Louisiana, namely Pete's horse, Rodeo.

"Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead 2","4,435",United States,"What began as the story of one man, is now a story about millions. After the film ""Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead"" documented his 60 day juice fast, Joe Cross vowed never to go on camera again. Since then, more than 20 million people have seen the film and Joe realized there's still a lot for him to learn about becoming healthy and staying that way. ""Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead 2"" taps into the tsunami of positive change that's sweeping the world when it comes to what we eat. As Joe sets out to learn how to be healthy in an unhealthy world, he talks to a wide range of experts, follows up with folks from the first film, and connects with new people along the way. Each one helps Joe learn that healthy eating is only one aspect of living a healthy life. From stay-at-home moms to world-class surgeons to office workers in Kenya, it seems like everyone is trying to be healthier, yet struggling to do so. While on the road, Joe experiences some ups and downs when it comes to managing his own weight. Joe's food battles resemble those of the everyday people he meets on his journey. Mirroring Joe's story is a series of testimonial videos submitted by people who saw the first film; their personal, intimate and often funny stories show that wanting to change is often easier than actually doing so. Top cardiologist Dean Ornish catches Joe by surprise when he explains that community is one of the most powerful forces in shaping a person's health. Joe finds out how true this really is when he catches up with Phil Staples, the truck-driver from the first film. Five years on, Phil is his own journey with varying levels of support and is dealing with his own set of ups and downs. It's Phil's experience that shows Joe just how big of an impact community can have. Through Joe's journey and the lives of the people he meets, Joe shows us in Fat Sick & Nearly Dead 2 that most people really do have control over of their health, even if they never knew it was possible. And that the final decision about what to put in your mouth, is what Joe calls, ""The last two feet of freedom."" —Anonymous",6.4

The film delves into a Beijing treatment centre and explores the cases of three adolescents from the day they arrive at the treatment centre through the three-month period of being held at the centre, and then their return to their homes. The film follows both the underlying issues related to the disorders, as well as the manner and treatment the patients receive. Professor Ran Tao established the world's first internet addiction clinic, and he promises to cure children of so-called internet addiction, which has grown into one of China's most feared public health hazards. The program admits children between the ages of 13 and 18 years; they are forced to undergo military-inspired physical training and comply with monitored sleep and food standards. Throughout their stay at the clinic, they are patrolled by the military guards who protect the children's quarters, which, like prisons, are surrounded by gates and fences. Despite such conditions, parents voluntarily send their children to the treatment centre and relinquish personal involvement. There is no one-on-one therapy, and the children's psychological needs are 'met' with group therapy sessions twice a week. The treatment is very expensive, and parents often borrow money in order to afford to send their child to the clinic. For them it is worth it - steering their child away from this addiction and redeveloping direct communication skills takes priority. 'Web Junkie' provides a microcosm of modern Chinese life, examines intergenerational pressures, and takes a hard look at one of the symptoms of the internet age. —Anonymous",6.4

CHAMPS unearths the unique resilience of these men in the face of life's most difficult obstacles - from personal finance to sustained brain injury - and highlights how our society and their industry exalts their fleeting success, but leaves them without the skills, protections, medical care and training that they need to succeed outside of the ring.

Salam - The First ****** Nobel Laureate,"5,212",United States,"""Salam"" is a feature length documentary about the Nobel prize winning Pakistani physicist, Abdus Salam. The film reveals the extraordinary life of the charismatic Abdus Salam, in all its color, vitality and tragedy. It is the story of a man who traversed two worlds with ease: one of science and religion, modernity and tradition, war and peace and obscurity and celebrity. When he won the Nobel prize in 1979, he became the very first Pakistani to achieve this distinction, and only the fourth from the subcontinent. Born in 1926 in a remote village in Punjab, British India, Salam was a child prodigy. He came from humble beginnings, growing up in a small brick house with a large family of eleven. While Salam's legacy looms large in the world of physics, he is largely forgotten in Pakistan because of his faith. Children do not read about him and he is still vilified and maligned by right wing clerics for being a ""Qadiani""-a derogatory term for someone belonging to the Ahmadiyya community. By telling this complex story of a man who due to extremism could not strengthen his people as he so deeply desired, the film draws attention to the state of affairs in the world today, where knowledge is sacrificed at the altar of ignorance and intolerance, depriving the coming generation of all that is precious.",7.9

Talent in every country is evenly distributed amongst gender; but opportunities are unfortunately not. In India, we have squandered the unrealized talents of millions of young girls. We hope Deepika's story can help shatter India's tragedy of small expectations for girls and put LADIES FIRST. —Shaana Levy Bahl",7.2

La limita de jos a cerului,"5,345",Moldova,"The Unsaved is a drama about about a Sancho Panza and not a Don Quijote. It's about the every day's non-hero facing circumstances and not adventures, it's about Viorel, a 25-year-old fledgling drug dealer, from a backwater little town in the contemporary Republic of Moldova. He lives at home with his mother, his ears get red when he's nervous and he lets his days pass in the usual ""laissez-faire"" Moldavian style. He gets involved through his best friend, Goose, in small-time drug dealing, while helping him to fly a hang glider that never seems to work properly; and he falls in love with Maria, the girl who happens to cut his hair. This easy-going existentialism precipitates several possibilities, which find our hero trapped in his own indecisiveness, so finally he reckons the moment has come for him to start growing up and act like an adult. The first thing he does is get a job peeling potatoes in the police canteen in order to make his mother proud. The second thing is to quit the drug dealing and become a serious man, but not before stealing a car engine to ""tune"" Goose's hang glider or delivering some drugs in his place. The third thing as an adult is to develop a serious relationship with a young woman, Maria, who is the lover of a drug dealer in jail, and at the same time a cop's mistress of convenience. All these attempts fail to lead him to the desired state of ""adulthood"", and our man-boy becomes less and less a hero, and more of a man just trying to get by. Cornered by the cops, Viorel exchanges his freedom for his best friend. He chooses not to fight for Maria and lets her go back to her cruel lover who gets out of prison. In the end, left all alone, he sees himself faced only with a dream, Goose's broken hang glider. The naivety he brought to stealing as in loving, the persistent urge to find the meaning of life through others, the careless way in letting the hours pass by, and finally the choice of believing that flying means only falling, are just few of the little dramas that turn the prosaic poetry of this story into a liberation struggle of the day to day life. —Anonymous",6.9

Hikaru Utada: Laughter in the Dark Tour 2018,"5,470",Japan,"If there was anyone you could call a true queen of J-pop, it's most definitely Utada Hikaru. She's one of the best selling artists in Japan of all time, with her debut album hitting almost 10 million copies sold. For many Western fans, she was one of the first Japanese artists to become truly popular, largely in part to a little song called ""Simple and Clean"" from the first Kingdom Hearts game. Her latest album ""Hatsukoi"" came out last year and in support, she embarked on her first full Japan tour in 12 years; ""Laughter In The Dark"". It completely sold out, and she's big enough to play stadium-sized venues. In a surprising announcement, when home and digital release details came out for a live filming of the tour, it included a Netflix announcement. The concert was filmed at the legendary Makuhari Messe in Chiba and was the final stop of her ""Laughter In The Dark"" tour. An absolutely much watch performance to be sure. She's a living legend for good reason; Utada Hikaru has one of the best voices in the world and the charisma to back it up. I was lucky enough to catch her live in New York City almost 10 years when she did a small string of shows in the states. To this day, I haven't forgotten a single moment of that night. I fell to the ground in awe when she busted out ""Passion"" from Kingdom Hearts II and doubly so when she encored with ""Simple and Clean"". There's a reason why her combined singles sales are well into double-digit millions, why her entire recent tour completely sold out, why she was chosen to represent the enormously popular Kingdom Hearts and Neon Genesis Evangelion. Hikaru Utada's ""Laughter In The Dark"" Tour releases on Netflix and other platforms June 26 2019. —theTVDB",8.3

In 1990, convinced that we were destroying the earth, they sent a warning through a British film-maker and then withdrew. They have now concluded that we cannot have grasped the warning and they have to explain it better if the world is to survive. So they recalled the film-maker and instructed him to film their demonstration of these connections, using 400km of gold thread. So begins a truly bizarre journey. We see people who have no wheel or writing, who know nothing of our world, seriously discussing dark energy with a leading astronomer and correctly identifying objects seen by the Hubble telescope. But as the journey gets under way they gradually realize that the film-maker has no idea what they are trying to demonstrate and their own arguments are treated as fantasy by a local biologist. So they change tack, taking us up into their mountain to show exactly what they mean, and then coming down to join forces with leading scientists who recognize that this is important cutting-edge knowledge dealing with a very grave issue. Their journey leads to apocalyptic horror, but in an astonishing resolution ends with an extraordinary joyful celebration of new life. —Alan Ereira",7.7

Soon he has to learn that the fruition of his dream is coming at a price for him and his young family. From the get-go, ZACH CRAIN and his team rely on the crowd to create knitted bottle koozies.

Unlike anything else soccer brings fifty-four diverse countries into a common and passionate dialogue.

As Reverend Tutu shares in ""The Beautiful Game"": ""soccer isn't like a religion in Africa. It is bigger than religion"". The film interweaves a number of dynamic stories from six separate African countries: Kenya, Egypt, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, and Ivory Coast. Together these stories reveal how soccer can be an effective social and developmental tool; and how a game can play a crucial role in shaping a new future for Africa. We have threaded our stories together with stunning visuals and with insights from some of the most famous Africans. Soccer fan or not, The Beautiful Game will inspire and move you. —Anonymous",7.2

 P.O.V.,"11,452",Israel,"The Chinese government is the first to classify internet addiction as a clinical disorder. Web Junkie (2013) identifies internet addiction and focuses on the treatment used in Chinese rehabilitation centres. The film delves into a Beijing treatment centre and explores the cases of three adolescents from the day they arrive at the treatment centre through the three-month period of being held at the centre, and then their return to their homes. The film follows both the underlying issues related to the disorders, as well as the manner and treatment the patients receive. Professor Ran Tao established the world's first internet addiction clinic, and he promises to cure children of so-called internet addiction, which has grown into one of China's most feared public health hazards. The program admits children between the ages of 13 and 18 years; they are forced to undergo military-inspired physical training and comply with monitored sleep and food standards. Throughout their stay at the clinic, they are patrolled by the military guards who protect the children's quarters, which, like prisons, are surrounded by gates and fences. Despite such conditions, parents voluntarily send their children to the treatment centre and relinquish personal involvement. There is no one-on-one therapy, and the children's psychological needs are 'met' with group therapy sessions twice a week. The treatment is very expensive, and parents often borrow money in order to afford to send their child to the clinic. For them it is worth it - steering their child away from this addiction and redeveloping direct communication skills takes priority. 'Web Junkie' provides a microcosm of modern Chinese life, examines intergenerational pressures, and takes a hard look at one of the symptoms of the internet age. —Anonymous",

As such, the President has not included any initiatives raised by Tom in the address, and has informed Tom through his Chief of Staff Charlie Langdon that he will soon be demoted to a position based in Montreal (which is framed as a promotion) or fired if he does not accept the demotion. Further, Tom has been assigned the designated survivor for the address, meaning that he will be housed in a secret secured bunker while the rest of the Cabinet enjoys the public visibility by joining the President at the Capitol for the address. Things for all involved change drastically when the Capitol is bombed during the address - the perpetrators initially unknown - with the President and the rest of the Cabinet killed in the process, leading to Tom being appointed President, something he never saw happening or to which he would ever aspire. Tom is insecure enough in his own abilities at this crucial time, which is only exacerbated by similar views by others, including Seth Wheeler, who was President Richmond's head speech writer, and Harris Cochrane, the Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Tom knows he has to look and sound Presidential to show the world that it is business as usual, meaning that his first speech, to be written by Seth in less than an hour, is of utmost importance. However, there are actions behind the scenes that could affect what happens.

Toph puts out her hand and bends a miniature pyramid, Aang sticks his hand out and creates a miniature tornado inside his palm, and when Katara puts out her hand she is seen holding a little water pinwheel. Sokka, being unable to bend, sticks his hand out, his thumb and pointer finger bent. He claims it is his boomerang. The others argue that 'boomerang' is not an element.Using Sokka as their guinea pig, Katara, Toph, and Aang each demonstrate their abilities, each trying to prove that their element is the best. Aang hits Sokka with an air blast and also hits Katara. Katara blasts Sokka into the air with her water, freezes him into a block of ice, and breaks it into small cubes of ice. Satisfied, she fuses the pieces back together.Toph tells Aang and Katara that air and water are both great elements, but that earth is better. Sokka tries to sneak away, but Toph sends him flying into a makeshift pinball machine formed out of the vertical side of a cliff and into Appa's mouth. Aang saves him, catching him in the air with his bending. Sokka thanks Aang and subsequently remarks that he is ""sick and tired of being everyone's personal dummy.""Aang promptly fills Sokka with air, inflating him like a balloon. He begins to float away, but when Appa's horn pokes Sokka's nose, the ""puffed up Sokka"" explodes. He subsequently crash lands into a pool of water, emerging carrying a fish in one hand.Zuko and Iroh suddenly appear on top of a cliff. Zuko shouts to them, asking if ""[they] call that bending"". Katara's eyes turn into hearts and she exclaims that the tiny Zuko looked cute. Zuko becomes enraged and steam begins coming out of his nostrils and mouth, and he yells that he is neither cute nor tiny, and briefly reverts to his appearance in the series. Iroh agrees with Katara, causing Zuko's temper to flare and he shoots a large blast of fire at the gang. The blast hits Sokka directly, causing the fish he was holding to catch fire and cook.Zuko claims that fire is the best and Toph takes it as a bending battle challenge. She begins to raise mountains out of the earth, and when she has finished she shows the others an aerial photograph of the mountains which form a picture of herself. Momo promptly holds up a ""7.6"" sign, Appa an ""8.2"", and Iroh claps with amazement.Aang makes a large ball of air, and using it as a trampoline, launches himself into the air, and while doing so, he breaks a piece of a cloud off and takes a bite out of it. He flies up to outer space, comes back down to earth, and lands on the ground. Momo puts up a ""6"" sign, Appa an ""8"", and Iroh shakes his finger in disappointment. Aang points out that through his performance he had made an arrow shape out of the clouds. Momo subsequently flips the ""6"" over to make a ""9"", Appa turns his ""8"" over, even though this did not change its value, and Iroh looks impressed.A nearby volcano erupts and Zuko is riding the lava. He uses his firebending to make a dragon out of the lava, shouting that he will ""bring in the heat"". Katara bursts his bubble by riding a giant wave over Zuko's dragon, putting his fire out, and leaving behind a little rock dinosaur created by the fusion of the magma and water.Iroh says that each element has its own strengths and weaknesses.
