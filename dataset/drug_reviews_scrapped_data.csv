Acetaminophen,"I had a distal gastric bypass in 1998 and now have bad joints and major back problems, being such a specialized surgery my family Doctor does not understand the major mal-absorption of Opioid Medications (hydrocodone and acetaminophen combination), which in my case, I had 63% of my small intestine bypassed which from what I get on the internet should make my pain med dose nearly twice what it is for a normal person.    Because this is a controlled substance, my hometown family Doctor tells me she cannot give me any more than the standard maximum dose, however now that I am much older I need a higher dose. She also told me that if I go to oxycodone she could not match the dose of hydrocodone.    I have tried to get my situation heard and understood only to find out other Doctors will not even see me because I have a pain contract with my family Doctor, and when I went to the DEA to voice my problems all they did was flag my file as being a possible drug addict or dealer, which it's very hard to get them to remove from your file. It took me three years.    I have tried the FDA and they move slower than the US Mail.    When I first went on hydrocodone it worked and kept me at about a 3 on the pain scale however, now that I am older and the reason I am on pain medication is getting worse, I cannot get a higher dose, and my Doctor simply does not understand anything about my mal-absorption problem with my distal gastric bypass surgery that requires me to have higher doses of nearly all oral drugs, but most importantly I am having the following problems.....  Vomiting,  nausea,    stomach pain,  Dark urine,  a strange light clay look to my stool,  skin rash nearly everywhere that seems not to ever heal,  cannot seem to sleep enough,  dry mouth,  developed asthma,  Itch all over,  dark spots (bumps) that seem to move from place to place,  puss filled eruptions on Skin.

Ibuprofen,i have taken ibuprofen for a long time( 10+) years off and on for back and leg pain. it has really done a good job of taking care of my pain-80% relieved. just in the last couple of months i have been having a real bad problem with my stomach and intestines hurting. i thought it was a virus. i quit taking it.after 2 days i resumed taking the ibuprofen and my stomach hurt so bad that i couldn't drink my coffee in the morning. i have never had ulcers. it felt like there were razor blades in my stomach. all i can say is that you can take the medicine for what seems like forever and then....you have to figure out something else to manage the pain. i know now that my life will not be the same and that i will have to manage my pain with acetaminophen(tylenol). i hope that i can get used to living with out the inflammation relief because tylenol is not an nsaid.Read More Read Less,3.7,Pain,2009

Ibuprofen,"It took me years to figure out that ibuprofen was actually CAUSING my headaches. It would initially help the pain of my headache, but I would get a rebound headache that was much worse, causing me to take more ibuprofen... Nothing else seemed to touch the pain, until I stopped cold turkey. I started taking daily magnesium supplements (400mg) along with calcium pills and B-Complex, stopped drinking diet sodas and drink water instead, and my headaches went away completely. I get 2-3 per year now and Tylenol does the trick. If you find yourself taking lots of ibuprofen, consider stopping it for 2 weeks and trying Aleve instead. Read More Read Less",3.7,Head Pain,2009

Tests for influenza and covid-19 were repeatedly negative. Finally my PCP decided to try amoxicillin experimentally for a so-far unidentified bacterial infection. About a half hour after my first dose, my body aches vanished, my face was slightly flushed, and I felt so normal it was almost euphoric. This is the fastest response I can remember, though at least two other times when I had severe bacterial infections something similar happened after about an hour. I've never had any serious side effects.

However it is protocol (or was) for those such as myself with a Mitral Valve Prolapse with Regurgitation, prior to any procedures, including cleaning.     I was very prone to urinary tract infections from about 17-30... at this time I discovered that taking this large of a dose of antibiotics resulted in a yeast infection, so was given a anti fungal to combat the side effect.

I'm not sure I can stand a whole week of bad IBS (and the medicine I'm on for that condition isn't helping now!) I've taken this in the past when I was young, but the effects seem to be a little more extreme this second time around. With all the talk about getting rashes, hives, and other bad reactions after being put on it again, I wouldn't be surprised if amoxicillin is somehow causing a type of allergy when used for antibiotic purposes, especially if there is a history of past uses.

Even with daily cleaning with his J&J baby wash each night,wash and dry at each diaper change with a protective layer of vaseline (I thought would help deter bacteria because that's what we did when he was circumcised) the scratch still began to get irritated. so I took him to see his Dr who then prescribed him anti-biotics to clear up any infection that may have been forming. It was the first time he'd ever been given this drug and it worked great! Within 2 days there was no sign of irritation but of coarse he stayed on it for the full 10 day cycle.

The ER Dr told us to use benedryl until the hives subsided. After a little over a week finally the hives were gone. In the mean time I made another appt for my son to be checked out,his Dr said that because he had the entire coarse it would take longer to get it out of his system. So I asked why it took that long for a reaction to happen and she said ""sometimes that's how it goes"" (less than helpful for 1st time mom) but now because of the severity of my son's rash he has eczema patches.

Metronidazole,"I take 500mg 3x’s a day. I have to say the only real big side effect for me is the blurry vision. Of course i googled and not much about it except reading people go blind- and to stop taking it if this happens. I called my doctor and she was hesitant and told me to stop that I may be one of those rare people with that side effect, i asked her what is my alternative if I stopped- what else can I take? She said there wasn’t and she would refer me to a gastroenterologist. After i read some reviews on here with blurred vision I decided to stick with it. I have some optical glasses i wear when i need to see far away- using these have been a god send because if not my vision is kinda messed up- (but it’s getting better) - i don’t want to say it’s blurry as in I cannot see anything at all as if I’m looking through a glass of water. It’s more like I have trouble focusing on things, slight double vision, and fuzzy when looking at things far away. I’m ending day 6 now- and in bed. I did have some diarrhea (which i never had) and feel a slight burning tingly sensation under my skin tonight. I’m glad I just have 4 more days. A lot of people on here mentioned crazy dreams- i have been having amazing sleep on this with some lucid cool dreams (nothing scary) but I wake up so rested before my alarm. I’m the biggest hypochondriac and was scared to take this- for me it hasn’t been a smooth ride- but sometimes you just need to so what you gotta do to feel/get better. Listen to your body- take ibuprofen if you get headaches (i had one really bad yesterday) - take Saccharomyces Boulardii Probiotics, and if your vision gets blurry try wearing your optical glasses.

Metronidazole,"i tried both the pill and gel form of flagyl for my recurrent bv. i had it 6 times this year for 8 months. i had pelvic pain /discomfort, and weird smelling vagina. i never saw anyone mention pelvic pain being one of the symptoms, but apparently it can happen according to the doctors i have spoke to. i tested negative for all stds but positive for bv. anyways the flagyl helped, until it came back a month later. the pelvic pain and then taking flagyl was like a routine for me for 8 months. i recommend the gel over the pill 100% btw. they both work the same to me but the pill is GROSS lol. i stopped having sex with my bf for 3 months cuz i thought i was getting it from him but i still got it even tho we weren't having sex for that long. i tried boric acid too and it didn't work. anyways antibiotics are bad for your body. it kills the bad bacteria that causes bv as well as the good ones that maintain a healthy vagina. it wipes EVERYTHING out. literally everything. i also didn't have a good diet (barely any fruits/veggies, typical american diet hahah) so there was no chance for the good bacteria to grow, and the bad bacteria overgrew every time. well i've been bv free for 3 months now. here's what i did: 1. PROBIOTICS. i take one with 20 billion. it helps lactobacillus grow which is the KEY to a healthy vag
2. eat healthy. you don't even have to eat that healthy. I make sure to incorporate smoothies in my diet everyday which has fruits/veggies in it. eating healthy is so good for your gut health (my gut health was terrible after all those antibiotics)
3. get a bidet. it just keeps your area clean. i think this can stop fecal bacteria from ur other hole from getting into ur vag. 
4. LUBE. omg this changed the game. i think rough sex when you're not that wet can also cause bv.
i have not had bv for over 3 months now :) if you have recurrent BV like i did, flagyl is just a bandaid. we all know it will come back. you have to find the root cause to truly fix it. Read More Read Less",3.0,Vaginosis caused by Bacteria,2021

Metronidazole,"The bad reviews freaked me out, just like lots of other people. Those side effects! I was especially worried about getting worsened depression (& loose stools). Thankfully, I did several things so I had no loose stools & I felt only a slight dip in mood towards the end. This is what I did and why:    - Set an alarm on your phone so you don't forget to take a dose.    - Take each dose at equal times apart. You want the level of antibiotics in your body to be consistent. If the time between doses is too short, you'll feel more side effects. If the time is too long, the bacteria has a small chance to grow back, & with antibiotic resistance. Take each dose 24 ÷ (# of doses per day) = __ hours apart. For example, if your dosage is twice a day, take each dose 24 ÷ (2) = 12 hours apart.    - Set an alarm to take supplemental probiotics in between your antibiotics. Antibiotics kill both good & bad bacteria. Without enough good gut bacteria, you'll get loose stools & depression (Google ""vagus nerve mood"").  Probiotics restore healthy gut bacteria. I'm no spokesperson, but Dr.-Formulated Mood+ is the best probiotics specifically for gut/mood health (Google reviews & research). So with my metronidazole, I was prescribed 1 tablet twice a day for 14 days. This is how I scheduled my daily doses:  10:30am - metronidazole  4:30pm - probiotics  10:30pm - metronidazole  4:30am - probiotics (It was inconvenient, but worth it. I'd just wake up, eat a bit, take my pill, then back to sleep.)    - Most importantly, take all your antibiotics. If you take probiotics in between your antibiotics and spread each dose an equal time apart, you will lower the bad symptoms. If you take all your prescribed doses to the very end, you'll have done your part to save humanity from death from antibiotic-resistant bacteria!    - Be at least a little full before you take both antibiotics & probiotics. You'll feel less upset stomach from antibiotics, & you'll get more benefits from the probiotics.    Good luck & godspeed!Read More Read Less",4.3,Vaginosis caused by Bacteria,2019

I also have to take Diflucan while on the Metro gel to not get a yeast infection.  Also, nystatin/triamcinolone cream to keep the bacteria under control and soothe my vaginal area.

I ended up doing home remedies and it took me about two months to get rid of it. I have been doing a lot of research about BV and have found that most of the time this medication does not work for people or their symptoms come back even worse. If my doctor would have just told me about the simple home remedies I could have tried, I would not have suffered for as long as I did.  I think it's ridiculous that something that is so common in women is so hard to get rid of and this medication along with another one is the only thing that doctors can treat you with.

I had moderate cramping across my abdomen with a runny odorous discharge.  The discharge stopped by day 1 on the Flagyl and the cramping subsided fully on day 2.  I had no itching or burning.  The Flagyl does taste bad, but I found that if I take it with coffee it masks the taste pretty well.  I've been on it 3 days and also find that I'm getting a metallic taste in my throat in between pill doses (I'm on 500mg 2x day).  I've felt a bit anxious 2 of the nights so far as some other reviewers stated - but it was nothing I couldn't calm down from and was only at night.  I've also noticed my normal ""smell"" isn't back yet, but I do have a weird smell (not the strong BV smell, but also not my normal smell) that seems to be caused by the Flagyl.  I'm hoping that goes away soon!  Additionally, not being able to have alcohol while on the Flagyl is a pain.

But as soon as I stopped taking it, it came right back. Bacterial Vaginosis can be serious. I'm not at all satisfied with this medication and won't take it again.

I found that eating a small meal before I took it and taking it with a glass of cold water...I am fine. I still have a few days to go, but I already feel and see a difference.

I agree, the taste was absolutely horrible, I had no idea about that. I realized it was easier to take a gulp of water and sort of plop the pill in my mouth and swish and swallow before ever having to taste it. Also, I made sure to take the pill every time on a very full stomach and since I don't eat meat that meant loading up on a lot of carbs.

All of my BV symptoms were gone after the first dose, but 3 months later I still had inflammation, so I am on round 2.  I am on day 2 but no real side effects besides a mild head ache and just general sleepiness.  You have an infection.  Your immune system is all messed up right now.  You are not going to be feeling great anyways.  Follow the directions (DO NOT DRINK. NOT EVEN A SIP OF BOOZE. EAT A FULL MEAL RIGHT BEFORE THE PILL.  HALF A CUP OF YOGURT OR A GRANOLA BAR DOES NOT COUNT). while staying away from these reviews, and you will most likely be absolutely fine.  I also take a probiotic with this pill twice a day and try to eat very healthy.  Limit sugar and yeasty breads bc of the chance of getting a yeast infection (I did the first time I was on this medication, so I have a pill for that to take at the end of my treatment).  Take extra special care of yourself while on these antibiotics.  Your immune system needs the help.  If you don't, you will feel worse.  If you are eating poorly, are overweight, underweight due to lack of eating, don't move around/exercise, don't get enough sleep...chances are you are feeling like crap most of the time anyways, but you get used to it.

Another words, if you drink excessively, you with be throwing up until you think your dying!! I didn't try to have a drink when I took it last time because of that statement. Everybody metabolizes medicines differently. Just because a lot of women have had every side effect possible, doesn't mean you will. If your symptoms don't start getting better after a few days, it might be in your best interest to call your doctor.

Wait about 15 mins to a half hour and then eat something and take the med.  After suffering from Candida from taking antibiotics, this seems to work.

While the non-coated pill is a little hard to swallow at times, I found it easy to take with a big gulp of water.

I did have a couple waves of nausea throughout the course of the medication, but it wasn't anything extreme, and they lasted maybe one or two hours. I didn't have any bowel movement issues nor any metallic taste or dizziness.

Metronidazole,"Okay ladies, here' my take:    I was prescribed this medication after going to my OBGYN and I was told that because of my super absorbant tampon usage frequency, it caused for my cervix to shed. I guess from the constant interal rubbing and friction but I was made aware that it was the fact of a super absorbant tampon being used during menstration that caused the problem. It all led to daily secretion while not uncomfortable, did make for many trips to go get panty liners.    Anyway, I thought that this pill was pretty effective. The secretions have all but stopped. The ONLY side effect was on day 2 or 3 I noticed abnormal pimples/breakouts....minor near my forehead but two big ones on my buttocks (it was just a weird place to have them). So that is all I noticed. No weird fainting or lightheadness or emotional instability. Definitely take while drinking. To avoid the taste (even though I wasn't bothered by it) just bite it in half and swallow the first part with juice. Repeat. You won't notice much of anything else after that.

Hydroxyzine,"Asked for this back in 2016 for longstanding anxiety that wasn't fully controlled by daily sertraline + gabapentin. On the plus side, it does help my anxiety and doesn't muddle my thoughts like Xanax. On the downside, the drowsiness from this medication noticeably reduces my desire to do anything and can last for up to two days after a single dose - and I'm convinced that my daily use of this medication between 2016 and early 2020 contributed to two depressive episodes.   I still use it when my anxiety is really bad, but I prefer to use Xanax. Even though Xanax makes me feel like I've dropped a few IQ points and has an addiction risk, I still prefer that over feeling lifeless and risking another depressive episode.  Everyone is different, though. My mother and my best friend both take hydroxyzine for anxiety. My mom only feels tired for a couple of hours and my best friend gets a dry mouth.

Hydroxyzine,"I live with Chronic IC better known as Interstitial Cystitis a bladder disorder. I was diagnosed with this in 1995. In 2007 I was diagnosed with Chronic Pelvic Pain Disorder. My Specialist put me on a cocktail of drugs to help with both disorders. One of them was Hydroxyzine HCL oral 25MG pills. This drug was only to be taken before bedtime. The reason was to help with the abundance of histamines in my body that cause inflammation. I have year round allergies and seasonal allergies. Inflammation in my body causes these disorders to flare-up inducing (chronic pain.) The drug also has a calming affect unlike other anti-anxiety drugs or drugs used for depression. It works completely different and you do sleep well. When you wake up you feel refreshed and not drowsy. The most important ingredient with anyone who suffers with any Chronic Pain conditions & disorders is to keep inflammation in the body at a minimum and to get plenty of sleep. A good nights rest rejuvenates the body so it can work at its full potential each day. If you suffer with allergies, live with any form of Chronic Pain and have anxiety,tension and stress issues that is usually accompanied with Chronic Pain sufferers then I would talk to your doctor about the use of this drug. In addition to what you are already taking for medication, and as long as it is safe with your doctor, I highly recommend taking Hydroxyzine HCL as part of your nightly cocktail.

Hydroxyzine,"Was given to me after severe anxiety attacks that had me in the ER twice in two days. Dr perscribed 25mg twice a day. Some advice first, after reading all the reviews. A lot of people who have spent a lot of time taking benzos will be biased straight off the bat. I am a tiny bit myself in a way because I know a benzo will knock a panic attack out quickly and yes, they work well. BUT, this medicine will work differently for everyone and going by other negative reviews and not giving it a chance, or taking it once and not being comfortable and coming on and leaving a bad review, OR reading all the side effects and imagining to get them after one dose..(Yes, extremely paranoid people do this often) is just scaring away people it may help..so my advice is give it a chance. Dont google, dont absorb all the side effects that are RARE and dont try it.  Anyway..ive been taking two weeks about, on and off, once a day. I started by quartering it, so about 6.2mgs for me. Thats a problem with drs giving a higher dose right away and then you sleep forever and cant function because you arent used to it. On a quarter of a 25mg pill, I slept most of the day the first day too. Just on that tiny bit. It did make me extremely tired and out of it but does calm my severe anxiety which has me bouncing off the walls. Better than ending up in the ER though. Took a quarter for another week and still very sluggish but not as bad and can stay awake. Second week, taking every other day but today upped dose to 12.5mg. Biggest complaint so far is the dry mouth I get with it. No other side effects besides tired and a bit zombie and calm. It DOES help with anxiety and my restless legs and feet, the adrenaline panic feeling BUT no it doesnt just wipe it out like Xanax, maybe because my dose is still low, but a little anxiety is normal, can't expect a cure all. I plan to give it a longer chance, but so far so good. Try it. People who love their Benzos ARE prematurely biased,upset when taken away.Read More Read Less",4.0,Anxious,2017

I was prescribed Hydroxyzine 25mg with Paxil.  The Pax for depression and the Hydrox for anxiety as needed 3x/day.  I noticed elevated anxiety as a result of feeling clouded from the Hydrox, as it is a classified antihistamine, same effects as popping a Benadryl.  I would not recommend this medication for anyone with severe anxiety and or panic disorder.  Instead of making you feel comfortable in public and daily functioning it makes you feel like a drowsy clouded mess.  Anyone suffering from anxiety will tell you that you just want to feel at ease and comfortable, confidant and relaxed.  This just seemed to make things worse for me.

I chose to stop taking this medication, so far I feel like I have so much more energy and I haven't swelled at all.

The agitation was a big part of that.  I am thinking it is one of the systoms I had to a much smaller extent and want to quit taking it if it can be addictive.  Can anyone respond to this.

Clonazepam,"I have a severe case of constant anxiety where I would describe it as like water forcing against a dam wall and not releasing and the pressure just stays and builds up forever without breaking. Ok so when I take my Klonopin it allows this water to break out of the dam wall and release about half of it. Klonopin is a great med to take but it's better to possibly not take it daily as you will build a tolerance  to it and even have bad, odd side effects. As you take it daily the med will continue to build up in your system, build and build until the concentrations are way too high. So I've discovered it's better to take 2 or 3 days off from time to time in order to get the drug out of your system a bit and then let your system reboot, and then when you take your next done it will feel much better and help your restless anxiety much better than consistently taking every day. Nice to get that reboot from time to time, trust me. When using it responsibly at your lowest effective dose, whatever that may be, depending on you, it should really help zap your restless, anxious racing mind and intense anxiety! Like I stated above,  it'll let that dam break its wall a little bit and release and relieve the pressure in the mind and even body and the worst of the dreadful anxiety. Be aware this is a very addictive drug, therefore you must really have a need for it like intense, uncontrollable anxiety, racing, agitated mind etc. If so, it'll help you but make sure to let your system clean out and reboot from time to time for a couple of days and it'll work the best like that. For me this is the best way, for you it may or may not but if you're dealing with a long period of intense, non stop anxiounsness and restlessness caused by mental issues etc, I'd give this a good try! I personally like the generic Mylan brand, other's have better luck with a different clonazepam such as Teva etc. My 2 cents. Talk to your doctor 1st of course as I certainly am no medical professional.Read More Read Less",4.0,A Feeling of Restlessness with Inability to Sit Still,2018

I'm not constantly pacing and my facial tics have gotten better, still get them but not as often. And this drug even helps out with my chronic muscle spasms due to mild scoliosis (lateral curvature of the spine). The only side effect, i'm noticing is minor memory loss.I seem to forget things alot lately such as remembering names, phone numbers...etc but it's nothing too alarming.The bottom line is this drug does wonders (Psychotropic-wise)and,in my opinion, safer and better than any SSRI.

Clonazepam,"I have been taking 2.5 mg of Clonazpam for 20+ years.  It is an extremely effective medication for panic disorder, general anxiety, and OCD for me.  I am 52 years old and after making planes turn around in the sky and 4 hours in security (pre 9-11) as I was certain my plane would crash, I was prescribed it starting at one mg a day.  After having a panic attack in traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge and getting out of my car to practice my breathing techniques at the rail of the Bridge, with people screaming ""don't jump,"" it was increased to the level I now take. (Fortunately it was late 1990's and a adorable Dr. In a Porche recognize what was happening and calmed the situation). So no arrest...  Lastly, I want everyone to know, one must tritrat off only with your physicians care and very slowly.  The withdraw symptoms are horrific when I tried once.  Eyes bouncing around shakes sweats etc.  this is drug dependence not addiction.  I also do not believe it to be an acute medication but not sure.  Xanax etc. Give me a hang over feeling the next day or. Headaches mid day.  Drinking and taking this mediation will make a person forget - memory loss.

Clonazepam,"After multiple hits to the head from sports and other activities,I developed lasting effects from multiple concussions.I waited a year before medication, with no improvement.Symptoms were sensitivity to light,sound,horrible constant vertigo,visual disturbances,and after all of that I developed an anxiety issue also.At this point, I didn't want to live anymore.I could barely function doing simple daily living tasks, my neuro put me on this med, and it has saved my life. It has helped with so many of the brain problems, and also takes the edge off the anxiety. Dose is .5 in a.m., .25 afternoon, and .5 at night. Cons of this med are withdrawals if I don't take it for a day, and it makes me kind of drowsy.But I can still get through the work day, take a nap afterward, and feel fine.

For years I had been up and interacting with my dreams during the REM, which most people are immobile. Not all dreams are nice. I had to put Tibetian bells on my apartment door so I would not outside during the night. One night I woke up swinging a baseball bat in my living room. I never got any good sleep.I finally got referred for a sleep study and got on these meds after many trials of other drugs. I sleep peacefully now for the past 30 years.

Clonazepam,"After taking clonazepam for about 6 months, Oct. '01 to April '02, I quit on my own cold turkey because it made me suidical and SO tired that I could hardly function.      During that 6 months, I told my Doc 3 different times that I was feeling more anxious and each time he upped my dosage.  So, I finally gave up and stopped taking it. On April 19, '02 I had a seizure due to the quick withdrawal of chlonazepam.  That was my fault.  I'm thankful I wasn't driving at the time!      Then, September of last year another one of my docs gave me chlonazepam again and within TWO weeks I had to be hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and I made slices down the whole length of my left arm with an open safety pin because I wanted to die but didn't want to kill myself.  I had also been on Ablilify for a year which made me feel restless, nervous, and anxious.      In the hospital my new doc took me off chlonazepam and Abilify and put me on seroquel and prozac.  I was hospitalized for 3 nights. BOTH times I took chlonazepam I felt extremely suicidal!! I've been on my new meds for a year and feel better than I've felt in my whole life!  My body does NOT react well to chlonazepam!!  I will NEVER take it again!     I AM pleasantly surprised that so many people gave GOOD reviews for it.

The only thing that it doesn't help me with is restlessness so I continue to have trouble falling asleep for 2hrs usually 4-5x's a week. Not everyone has the same reaction to medications. This one is though by far the most Effective for Panic Disorder after I've been on more than I can count in the Benzo Family and many others.

For about 1.5 years (starting 2 years ago) I only used 0.5MG's maybe a half dozen times total. At that point they were no good and it was me dealing with my panic and anxiety attacks. Obout 6 months ago I went back on them because of losing myjob and issues with getting unemployment payments. Was put on Cymbalta for nervous ticks and this has been only used maybe another half dozen times. when i need it it works great. I never got addicted or needed to watch out that I was going to be dependent on it. I can see a life with very few panic attacks on the horizon soon. I can also say that Xanax only worked for a while for me and then didn't.   It is also extremely important for people to make sure that they dont up the doses without help from a doctor first. Also if someone is a drinker this med or any anti anxiety med will have less if any effects.   I feel that this med has helped me so much with another med to control the main anxiety issue plus a little Cognitive behavioral therapy has helped me.

Clonazepam,"I have advanced osteoarthritis and several bulging discs which are inoperable.  I did have a laminectomy at L4/5 thirty years ago.  I was experiencing random muscle spasms in my back, right leg and right arm so severe that I was medically retired (total disability) under Social Security. I am now 63 and have been retired about five years.  My last Orthopedic doctor agreed to try and lessen the spasms with an anti anxiety drug, I had learned from a Pharmacist acquaintance that it might be of use.  The relief was verging on spectacular  and a year later when I had moved to another State and entered a Pain Relief Clinic the medication was changed to Clonazepam 2mg twice daily, as needed.  My condition improved so much that 2 mg at bedtime has all but stopped the spasms,  On occasion I may have to use more but I have had no side effects and my quality of life is up 50%.

Clonazepam,"Having been diagnosed with severe anxiety some three years ago, I was given the usual front-line medications: lexapro, cymbalta, paxil, etc. None of them worked; in fact, the paxil gave me serotonin syndrome, which effectually ended my usage of SSRIs. I had been begging my psychiatrist to prescribe a benzodiazepine throughout my treatment. Finally, he did. I have been taking Clonazepam for some three months now, and I can only say that this drug has saved my life. My debilitating anxiety is gone; I no longer have panic attacks; I have returned to college, and I am generally more happy than I have been for years. The only side-effect I have experienced is a slight drowsiness beginning about an hour before I go to bed.  For anyone who has severe, chronic, debilitating anxiety, and is willing to take this drug AS PRESCRIBED, I can only offer my own experience as a full-hearted endorsement for the responsible use of benzodiazepines (such as Clonazepam). I have experienced no cognitive impairments, as my performance at school can attest to.Read More Read Less",5.0,Panic Disorder,2010

Clonazepam,"I was prescribed this drug for panic attacks, and it slowly helped to put me into one of the worst addictions I have experienced to benzodiazopine drugs. Like xanax, it made me apathetic, forget to eat, zoned out, kind of a zombie effect. When .5 milligrams stopped working, I started to take 2 at a time. Then 3, then 4, and so on. Within about 3 months I finished a bottle in a day, just to function. I needed it to sleep, to avoid withdrawal which included panic attacks worse than I started with, to be around people, to socialize, to go a day without freaking out. I chewed them to kick in faster, and since they taste okay I had no problem chewing 5 or 6 at a time. This drug brought me to my knees faster than anything and along with xanax, was the reason I decided to get sober. I don't think my history of addiction contributed to the addiction I experienced with this drug, because it is known for making all types of people dependent on it.

Clonazepam,as i said the drug has help me. if anyone would ask me  i would say do not take. The reason i say this is it is very habit forming. When you have taking it for a long time you have trouble getting off of it. My dr. wonts to take me off of it. I have tryed once and i through i was going crazy. I was having withdrawls so bad that i had to call her and go in. She was scared that i might hurt my self. But i knew it was the medican that was making me feel that way so i would tell myself it was just the medican. My dr. didn't know how to get me off so i wrote the company that makes it was told they didn't know how the help me. I am back on it now. I don't like being on something i can't get off of and the company can't help . They can sell . I got on the web site and try to find someone who might could. I got a lot of answered about it was hard to come off of it but if you could go throw the withdrawls it would take a while. I may try again but not sure i can go throw the withdrawls.  They said that if you was able to get off you may not be able to stay off of it. This is just what i thank. But if you need it take it for a short time or ask for something else. If you are trying to come off it good luck. Try not to get in any hurry just take it one day at a time.Read More Read Less,3.7,Other,2010

Clonazepam,"It was hard getting my doctor to prescribe a benzo, as I don't have panic disorder but rather an often debilitating social anxiety. Im taking .5mg 2x a day, a very low dose that belies how effective it's been for me.    In social situations I no longer feel like I'm always doing or saying embarrassing or stupid things; my speech and behaviors are no longer inhibited by a perceived omnipresent public scrutiny. When I drink now, it's not a desperate move to ""prep"" myself for a meeting or party. Instead it's for my own enjoyment.     In class I engage the professors regularly (often zealously with my opinions) and have become good friends with some of them. I do find it difficult at first to stay awake when it kicks in during a class, but I had that problem before the clonazepam. Perhaps the only negative aspect is the memory loss, an effect I perceive probably more than most people, being a student. The gaps in information, when they exist, are generally negligible anyway.    I've been on 200mg Zoloft for years now (for the aforementioned anxieties and OCD), and yet I always felt that my symptoms weren't completely resolved. Though I am aware of the fleeting nature of benzodiazepines' anxiolytic effects, I have come to terms with the possibility of being on such a drug for a long time. Unless it leads to abuse, the benefits far outweigh the costs of klonipin. I am a better person now, because I don't have to live in fear.Read More Read Less",4.7,Other,2009

I thought I should take 2 since I was perscribed 3 a day and after 2 days of that I was groggy all day at work and even fell asleep at work briefly.  After about 9-10 days of taking, I became a disoriented, walking zombie.    After leaving a work party (w/literally 2 sips of wine) at approx. 7:30, I fell asleep on the train ride home (which happened often while taking the medicine but never before in many years of riding the train).  The conductor woke me up and I knew I was a little tired but never thought I was too bad to drive.  I was leaving a (thankfully) nearly empty train station parking lot and blacked out or fell asleep and crashed my car into a cement light fixture.  It knocked me awake and I thought someone hit me and looked around and there was no one in sight.  That was a Thursday, that weekend I tried 3 (as perscribed) and slept most of the weekend and was groggy for a couple days after discontinuing med altogether.  I stopped the med and called the dr but she was on vacation.  A couple weeks later she had me try much lower dose (.125 mg 2 - 3 x day) but it still made me tired but not as bad and didn't seem to notice any real positives.Read More Read Less",2.3,Other,2009

But after a week I started feeling general anxiety about situations where I normally have just a little uneasiness.   As the 2nd week went on.. my anxiety grew stronger and stronger.. but when I hit a state of panic attack the drug kicks in and I feel calmer and don't feel the emotional effects of the panic attack.  I do have the racing heartbeat though.. so I take a beta blocker (propanolol) to help slow it down a bit. I was still able to sleep. Until two nights ago when my anxiety about being able to get to my doctors appointment on time woke me up too early.   then I spoke with the doctor about my symptoms and he said I was having daily anxiety withdrawal as the drug started to wear off the next morning.  He switched me to tazepam but the pharmacy wants 430 dollars for 60 pills... who can afford that? The doctor also put me on Citalopram 10 mg yesterday for 6 days and then go to 20 mgs after that.  I took my first pill last night and woke up early so I have insomnia and feel very tired and am subject to anxiety still.  I would like to get off clonazepam soon so I can get some sleep and not feel so exhausted and vulnerable.    For short term use.. 2 to 3 weeks, this drug is okay. For long term use..

So I stopped taking it after a month and the feeling in chest came back, my legs would feel weird and I just felt like I was going to pass out. I am happy go lucky I do not understand. But another psychiatrist said it is how my body handles stress even though you do not realize you are stressed. so he put me on clonazepam .5 mg one a day but i only take as needed. I have been taking for 10 years but the key is take as needed. I take half .5 mg pill as needed. I use about 60 pills a year taking a half pill when needed.That would be .25 mg.

I still feel stressed at times but the pill seems to do the trick. If i took one .25 every day maybe I would be fine all the time but I believe I would have to up the doseage as time went by and eventually it would no longer work.

Because of the severe pain and muscle spasms I had very hard time falling a sleep or staying a sleep, The treating doctor prescribed different Sleeping pills including Halciaon , ambien and some other sleeping pills but none worked for me. So I was prescribed 1 MG of Clonazepam for sleep. The clonazepam alone did not help me but taking it together with Halcion made me sleep. It was around 2001 or 2002 from that time to now I had about eight spine surgeries and disk removed and bones fused. Nothing took care of the pain. So I was referred to a pain management Doctor there I was put on Oxycotin, Oxycodone and Morphine this was around 2006. Then I had another lower back sugary and I felt a little better and decided to drop off some of my medication with in a week I was able to quit every thing but Not Clonazepam It was and is almost impossible to quit this drug. I gave it up for about one week and I could not stand up, was always shaking could not hold a cup or anything and could not walk straight I went to my pain mgmt.

Clonazepam,"I started on Lorazepam but an ER doc decided that it was not working enough because it didn't last long enough.  I ended up on 2mg of Clonazepam a day.  I took that for about 2 weeks after almost 3 months on Lorazepam.  A new pcp decided to cut my dosage down to .25mg a day all at once.  The withdrawal started immediately.  It has not been too bad yet but I'm only in my 5th day.  On the second day I just stopped taking it altogether since it was doing nothing for me anyway (the withdrawal symptoms create their own anxiety).  However, while on this drug, I did not have a single panic attack.  I did experience moderate to severe dizziness at times (especially on standing rapidly or moving my head too quickly) and a severe loss of appetite.  I thought that bad at first but discovered that eating very small portions more often allowed me to gain my appetite back.  Since I was overweight to begin with, this turned out to be good as I have lost nearly 20 pounds.  I have read from others that they take doses only when they feel a full panic attack coming on rather than routinely to combat constant anxiety.  I will be attempting that if I actually have a full blown panic attack.  I'm close a lot of the time right now but know that much of it is withdrawal.  I would recommend that, if you have been prescribed this medication for routine, daily dosage that you talk with your doctor about changing to an ""as needed"" drug to avoid serious withdrawal symptoms.  Also, avoid alcohol when you've taken this.  It really knocks me for a loop.  All in all, it is a decent drug but the addiction factor really needs to be considered before taking.

Clonazepam,"I've was prescribed Clonazepam by my Primary Physician; my depression had advanced to a somewaht mild form of Bipolarism.  Given the the dosage prescribed (.5mg), I didn't think it was going to work, given that I was taking 40 mg of Prozac.  Upon taking the first pill I noticed a different within an hour; I slept liek a baby for the first time in years.  When I work up, I felt such a sense of calm that it pleased me--yet frighted me-at the same time.  I went to work for the FIRST TIME with a PLEASANT DISOPSITON; I didn't need to get two martinis at lunchtime in order to get through the rest of the day.  I wasn't SNAPPING OFF at my family that evening. Granted, by the FOURTH TABLET I began feeling quite lightheaded, walking somewhat wobbly.  I ate a good breakfast and some fruit and relaxed.  Of all the meds I have taken over the past eleven years, I have found this one to be working (so far so good). As for the possibility of becoming addicted to the meds, I been through enough enough addictions to such meds that I force my self to rise above it--because I want to get better.  I don't feel I'm in the place to recommend this to anyone; what can be one person's Nirvana can be another person's Purgatory. If you have a good doctor (Primary, Psycologist, other) whom you feel you can trust and will prescribe a med that will work for you (and only YOU), go for it.

Clonazepam,"This is one of the most dangerous drugs in the world and I can't understand how any doctor in good conscience could ever prescribe it for anyone.  I am so sorry I ever took that first pill...I began having problems from the start but didn't think it was the drug and the doctor didn't seem to know what I was experiencing was coming from the drug either.  I would get extremely lightheaded, so much so I could barely function; all I wanted to do was lay around because I had no energy or interest in doing anything, even the most simple things became difficult to do. It also numbs you emotionally and my mind and memory have been dulled.  Take anything but this drug.  No one explained to me that this drug is a class that is not like antidepressants, but it's a hynotic drug.  It should be used ONLY for very severe cases of panic or seizures...not for anxiety like I have and even then for only short periods of time...two-4 weeks. Please don't let anyone talk you into taking this drug.  You willl find it's a living hell if you ever want to come off of it.  From the things I have read, everyone who has tried to come off of it has had horrible experiences with withdrawal due to your whole nervous system being dependent upon it.  Your body is no longer able to function normally.  Your brain no longer manufactures its own hormones because this drug has taken over.  It will take a long time for your brain to begin to make it's own again.  Other organs are affected, also.

During the first few month of the treatment the psychiatrist also prescribed oral clonazepam for me to take whenever the panic attack comes.

Clonazepam,"Klonopin is the best all-around benzo on the market; however, it is highly addictive.  It works great for many symptoms, especially panic/anxiety; however, your body slowly develops a tolerance for the drug, meaning that you will ultimately have to take more and more for it to demonstrate efficacy, which could push the dosage into dangerous areas.  I believe that around 1.5mg - 2mg has addictive potential, so just be careful.  Also, if you have reached the aforementioned threshold of addictiveness, be VERY careful when trying to get off of Klonopin.  The withdrawal symptoms can be very serious - even deadly (seizures, &c.) - so do not precipitously stop taking the drug.

We lost our home and a lot of family to death and murder at this time and I was in dire need of help.     I was given Lorazepam for a few months, but it was more situational.. Seriosuly, I was so stressed it was at a point of rage in traffic, etc. By the time I needed the lorazepam to work it was too late so my Dr. then prescribed my clonazepam.

But the Clonazepam is what really turned life around. Together I am a strong healthy woman able to cope with everything.

Azithromycin,"I have taken Azithromycin many times before throughout previous years for most often times, upper respiratory infections. 
My symptoms typically include: throat irritation/ sore throat, cough, runny/ stuffy nose, increased drainage and production of mucus. 
Each time taking this medicine I’ve been dosed 250mg 2 pills the first day and 1 pill for 4 days after (in which the medicine keeps on working for days after completion of day 5’s pill).
In the past this medicine has been great for me in clearing infections fast with minimal side effects. My most recent time of taking it I developed a yeast infection due to too many uses of this medicine. I had also developed stomach issues as a side effect (diarrhea and nausea).
Overall this seems to be a great medication for minimal use- for reoccurring infections I’d suggest using different antibiotics to prevent yeast infections in women.Read More Read Less",3.3,Bacterial Infection with Chronic Bronchitis,2023

Went to the DR on day 3; fever had broken the night before with the help of NyQuil....it came down to 99.8 at the DR office by then.  My throat culture came back negative, so she called my condition ""Pharyngitis"", but treated it as Strep.  I was a given the 5 day Z-Pak.  24 hours later, I had major improvement.  I could swallow solids, but I still had a sore throat.  Coughed up a bunch of stuff from my lungs, and by day 5 the infection went into my ears.  My sore throat is returning, (though no fever), and my ears are plugged and my head has a stuffy feeling.  I have vertigo (because of the ears), and I've completely lost my sense of smell, therefore my tastebuds are also compromised.  I can taste sweet, salt, and sour, but no nuances of flavor in my food.  I even tried chewing a piece of Mentos peppermint gum, and cannot taste the peppermint, only the sweetness.  Is this another side effect of A-Zith?  I can breathe freely through my nose, so this new development is perplexing.  If I continue to have the aforementioned symptoms, I will be returning to the DR.  So, all in all, I'm not convinced that A-Zith is the wonder drug for me.

I will call Dr. to see what she recommends I do next since after four days of this alleged super drug, I still have a cough though my lungs feel terrific, I have yellow mucus and my ear hurts and the sinus cavities over my eyes.

The occasional tramadol and daily Celebrex have worked wonders for me at this time. Prior to my cervical fusion 4 years prior I had a Lumbar L4-5 fusion which finally has healed as well. Tramadol may not be for everyone or work on everyone but I've had good results. You have to figure out what least amount of mind alternating drug works for you. If it's truly for pain that a person is taking it for it should bind to the pain receptors and help with the pain. If it's not for pain then it doesn't have a receptor to bind to causing a ""high"". If it doesn't work the receptor in your brain may need a different medication to bind to, to help relieve the pain you are having. Remember there are many different medications for this reason. And always remember it's usually not likely to have ""0-10"" pain rating. Most people have pain and suffering of some sort and everyone reacts to pain differently then the next person.

No head aches or itching thus far taking the Tramadol 50 mg twice daily.   I have heard the withdrawal stories but believe some are more susceptible than others! And everyone is different.  Tramadol is definitely not an immediate substitute for real opiate pain relievers. Doc wanted me off hydrocodone for two weeks before starting tram!adol!   After going off Hrydrocodone I did experience some discomfort for a week.....unexpectedly because I had been on 4 times that amount for four years.... a few years before the ""opiate hysteria era"" started and tapered off without discomfort.

Pain relief is about 50% of a 5/325 hydrocodone.....but that's better than nothing and good enough for full function.!!Read More Read Less",3.3,Joint Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function,2015

I have a high resistance to painkillers, hence why I'm on it. But this doesn't always work for me.   Takes about 45 minutes to kick in and can last up to 10 minutes to a couple hours.

I've always had bad dreams, but lately they've seemed too real and I'm waking up in sweats.   Overall it's an okay painkiller, just make sure you only take it when you need it as you can get hooked right on it.   Would recommend eating before taking them too.

Tramadol was prescribed to relieve pain associated with Shingles, the treatment was not effective (but that is likely due to the nature of shingles pain, not ineffective drug).

I was nervous, anxious, could not sleep through the night.  Consulted PC.Dr who instructed me to keep reducing the dose, and to take 1.5 tabs (even though drug manufacturer indicated splitting pills was not recommended).  I spoke to my CVS pharmacist and explained my symptoms, he said all of my issues were commonly described as side effects when stopping the medicine.  Pharmacists advice was to stop taking the pills (cold turkey); I did.

I ran out of this med on a friday & requested a refill through my doctor's on call service. They refused - I was devastated - had the worst most horrible withdrawal for 4-5 days. I am glad I am off this medication now. I have been trying to use otc meds sparingly along with 1-3 Lyrica daily & cymbalta (have taken both for years as well). I still have mild to severe pain at times - sometimes all throughout the day -  especially at night. The good part - I don't feel the need to take meds every 4-6 hours like I have -daily- for years. I feel pain & sometimes I can even function without meds - it's totally new to me. Don't get me wrong - I have to takes breaks while working. I have to lie down for breaks sometimes. Sometimes pain causes me to walk so slow at work people ask if I am okay - I just try to answer with a positive attitude & gather my strength to keep moving without reaching for meds. I am managing okay.  I could not have said this while on tramadol because I always needed the next dose & an hour after ingestion to feel good enough to get moving & mentally feel better.

It helped somewhat, enough for me to continue it's use for years but after about 3 years I started to feel unwell. I was getting terrible jitters and having problems sleeping. My heart rate and blood pressure remained normal but inside I felt like I had consumed a dozen double espressos. I couldn't sleep without medication. I thought it was stress related and it took months for me to determine that my body was craving more tramadol. It was as though I walked through a physiological doorway and while the medication helped with the pain in my neck, the amount I was taking daily was not enough to satisfy my physical need for it. I tried to wean myself on my own and the withdrawal was horrendous.I finally broke down and saw my personal physician, not the doc who prescribed the medication and I have been on a several month process of weaning myself.

The process has been REALLY difficult for me and my family. I'm writing this to warn anyone thinking of using this pain killer to think twice before doing so.

Last year I tried chiropractic and acupuncture with minimum results, it eliminated the muscle spasms but still have the stiffness and lower back pain.  This year I went to the same surgeon and the dr prescribed Baclofen, 10mg along with Tramadol HCL 50mg 3x’s per day as an initial therapy along with stretching to see if it will eliminate the back pain.  Initially the meds relieved the pain in my shoulder and hip but minimum relief in lower back (same area as previous surgery) and the mid back region is still a problem (feels like the onset of muscle spasms without the spasms).  After 2 wks, shoulder and hip pain are still gone, lower back still hurts and stiff but only a dull ache instead of constant pain and mid back is bothersome. side effects are; constipation, problem urinating (stream not as hard and going more often) and reduced sexual functions (this alone will stop me from taking the meds).      I will continue taking for 30 days along with the stretching and then decide if I want to continue taking the meds.

But to say this does not work?  People are under dosing or simply have a different metabolism.    The thing about tramadol is it makes you feel good too. Its like a rush of serotonin. You may have to take it month to get that, but once you do its like an anti depressant, you will be the most happy person in the world. PLUS, it totally eliminated MY lower back pain due to a bulging disk and degenerate back disease.    The reason it is so tough to get off is becasue it actually works on three levels unlike opiates that work on one. I say to the people that think it does not work, your docs are under dosing you or again you simply have a different body chemistry or just crave a true opiate.     It works and to well and is way more addictive than any opiate ever! I stopped even though I am in agonizing pain because I am tired of having to rely on a dam pill to get going or feel normal.

Tramadol,"This is the second time in my life on this medication, the first was several years ago for about two months.  Following the first experience, I had developed a physical dependance I was not aware of.  I tapered down, but still experienced 3-4 days of withdrawal symptoms (RLS, insomnia, achy).  I reluctantly started this medication for a different condition this time and have been on it for about nine months.  I'm again weaning down and expect to be off in a few weeks.  I know what is coming this time and it's not going to be fun, but the medication is very effective for minor neurpopathic pain and to me, was worth the risk associated.  I'll take some time off work and deal w/ the withdrawal this time now that I know what lies ahead.  If you do not have the luxury of being able to take some time off work to come off the medication, I'd probably steer clear of this med.  I will say, however, that I did not experience any ""craving"" for the drug, so I believe the addiction potential is low, but just the physical dependance is high.  I strongly believe it is the SNRI effect of the drug that makes it difficult to stop, not miniscule opioid effect.  I experienced very few side effects from this med and is very tolerable to the system vs other opioid-type of meds.Read More Read Less",4.3,Neuropathic Pain,2011

It was inconvenient to get up at 3:00 A.M., drink a glass of milk and sit up for an hour.  I wait at least 1 hour before lying down and haven't had any nausea.  I am now taking two twice a day.  No nausea, but very dry mouth when taking maximum dose 3 times a day.  Dr said I was having muscle spasms in my head, neck and shoulders.  The doctor did a Nerve Block first thing (2 injections each in skull and neck to sedate nerves and let them heal; 4-5 injections in shoulders to break up knots in my shoulders.  It worked.  Additional diagnosis will be done next week using EMG and Bone Scan.  I took Soma, Tylenol 3 Naproxen but that medication had absolutely no effect.  Very happy with this little non-narcotic pill.

My mom called Telehealth, the nurse advised if it got worse to head to the hospital, but for now just keep an eye on me. About 10 minutes later my heart started beating very fast. We went up to the hospital and they took me right in. When we got there I was hooked up to a heart monitor and my heart was going around 130 b/min. I started getting twitches every so often. And every once and a while the doctor came in and hooked me up to a heart monitor that was not attached to the wall and took me for a walk to see how fast my heart was going. Every time I got up it would go 140-160 b/min. And I was very dizzy. After a few hours I was very tired and tried falling asleep, but every time I did I would twitch and it would startle me.

Tramadol,"All Prescription and even OTC medications do not have the same effectiveness and side effects in all the people that take them. This is true for Tramadol, and as one patient said, they get 6 hours of relief, and I am lucky if I get 4 hours. Have taken Lortab then Percocet for 22 years. Seven (7) knee surgeries, L-3 & L-4 discs are dead and L-5 S-1 is really bad. I give presentations and speak to Hospital Groups, Drug Companies and Aerospace - I do not drink; but I don't miss a beat or even feel dizzy or sleepy or ""out"" of it. Went to Percocet because Lortab wasn't working as well after 16 years, but I take the smallest dose of both those meds, but I wanted to try Tramadol as it operates the same as the others - but is not a narcotic or a NSAID. The Acetaminophen is hard on Liver and Kidneys (even Stomach), read the label on it next time your in the store. That was another reason to try Tramadol, but it did not make a normal life possible. I tried it for 3 months, but Percocet dulls the pain to an Arthritis type ""ache"" and stops the sharp pain. Tramadol tries but falls short for me, and doesn't help with my Osteo-Arthritis even when I went to every 3 months on Cortisone shots, from every 6 months.

Still stiff and sore but I actually vacuumed out my car today and it didn't hurt.  This is huge for me.  Am feeling a little ""happy"" and energetic but hey...maybe that's because I'm not wracked with pain for once.  I don't know what the future holds for me with this drug.  If I am going to need pain meds in the future I feel less guilty taking this one instead of Vicodin or Percocet.  Reading about the withdrawl symptoms from other users does scare me but having arthritis for the rest of my life is scary too.Read More Read Less",4.3,Pain,2011

Tramadol,"I was prescribed 50mg every 6 hrs.  Used 1 pill the first time and thought I was on crack.  I liked the energy, but it gave me a feeling of anxiety.  Over time that has disappeared.  I can now use up to 2 1/2 pills at one time.  The tolerance is going up but that is after taking it over a year.  It takes away all headaches and muscle pain from Fibro Myalgia.  I don't care about addiction, I would rather live pain free and enjoy the ""happy"" feeling I get when using it.  Don't drink alcohol at all and the only other meds I have is Firocet and xanax/valium.  Don't need the last two now that I have the Tramadol.  It will work differently with everyone.  For the most part it is a life saver for me.  If I use too much at once I do get over anxious.  So take as prescribed.  I have never had to take more than 2 1/2 per day.  If I decide to stop I will go down gradually.  I do not wish to experience any withdrawals.  I get worse withdrawals from sugar!!!!  Tramadol causes some itchiness but thats about it.

Tramadol,"My doctor originally prescribed 100mg/day for fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathy. Over the course of 4 years of treatment, I had gone up to 200mg/day with adequate pain relief. The problem started in April when I asked my doctor to go to 250mg. He agreed, and called it in, but no longer did I have refills. I had to call every 30 days to get a refill approved. The bottle from the pharmacy said 'Please call 72 hours in advance for refill approval' so I did. I got a nasty call from the doctors nurse telling me that if I needed more meds so early, I had to get an appointment and come show the doctor why I needed them so soon. I wasn't out, I had about 5 days worth left, as I didn't always take the full dose. She finally did call the pharmacy and refill it, with strict instructions that I couldn't pick it up until day 30. I decided right then and there to wean myself off. It did take me 3 more months to wean off, but I did it. Haven't had a tramadol since August. I can REALLY tell now how much benefit I was getting from the drug. My moods were better (tramadol acts on serotonin, and thus should never be taken with an SSRI antidepressant) my RLS was very infrequent, I had bounds of energy, even my asthma was better (tramadol can act like a bronchodilator in some people, this is considered a side effect). I even lost 90 pounds over the four years. Now, two months off it, I am exhausted constantly. Nothing seems to help. My RLS is back with a vengeance making it even more difficult to sleep, and I've gained back 10 pounds. Tramadol is an opioid, not a narcotic as some commenters have said. Yes, it has the potential for addiction and abuse, and yes, getting off it after long term use is difficult. Would I go back on it if I had the option? Yes, in a heartbeat.Read More Read Less",4.7,"Disorder characterized by Stiff, Tender & Painful Muscles",2010

Tramadol,"I started taking Tramadol after I had surgery or cancer. Then I took Tramadol for severe Menstrual Cramps. It stops pain, but as another reviewer mentioned- it makes you happy. Its hard to explain but I call them my Happy Pills. This is probably in people who tend to have anxiety, as it lessens anxiety. It also gives you energy initially, and then gives you a good night's sleep as it wears off. Make sure not to take it too close to bedtime- at least 3-4 hours before bed because of the initial subtle energy rush.     I have heard that Tramadol can be addicting, but as long as you wean off them, as recommended, you'll be OK- take one less pill a day, and your last pill take at about 3PM.

Tramadol,"I was on tramadol for two or three years.  I thought I had fibromyalgia.  I was tired much of the time and took long naps when able.  I would get so tired when driving that I often would ask my wife to drive.  I knew I was addicted but it took a long time to be willing to get off of it.  I gave the pills to my wife to dispense to me on a slowly tapering regimen.  (This was after trying to do so alone many times.)  I had a very high level of discomfort during my drug withdrawal.  There were many nights of little sleep.  As much as the drug gave me a mild buzz for those three years, the withdrawal gave me an intense agony for three or four weeks...especially at night (I suppose my body was begging for the drug.)

The best part for me is the lack of discomfort from digestive side effects such as constipation, nausea, and vomiting which are common with opiate derived pain relievers.

Tramadol,"I started with 50 to 100mg per day and during 3 years I required increased dosing to be effective and was up to 300mg of ER (extended release).

Tramadol,"I must be fairly pain tolerant .. I have hurt for years, but in the year B4 taking this med, my pain was basically a 10 ... 24/7.  I am 59, have never taken anything except OTC products ... Tramadol has made the pain bearable to almost none. I take 50mg 2x a day (for almost a year) ... and I can function!! I was having a hard time even getting out of bed and doing simple daily chores, or work.  I have had some side effects ... sometimes sleepy, a little 'lazy' (but, I was extremely hyper )... a tiny bit of nausea and some light headedness... I have lost about 15 pounds, but I was about 50lbs overweight ... so, in that respect, I feel better.... BUT, NONE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE SEVERE ENOUGH, OR OFTEN ENOUGH TO STOP THIS MEDICATION.

I also have Sjogrens Syndrome, and this Tramadol helps to get me through my rigorous work day.  I am constantly moving and lifting, shifting and some repetetive actions within my job, and this makes it possible to get through.  I can tell when I do not take it, I feel it in my muscles and joints.  I take 50 mg in the a.m. before work, and if my level of activity begins to become more of a struggle, I will take another dose but not too much later in the day, it can cause sleeplessness to a degree.  I have migrain headaches too, and this seems to keep the onset to a minimum, less is more on that note.

Tramadol,"I use this for herniated discs.  It is not nearly addictive as the hydrocodone or other opiate type drugs.  It also does not have the increased tolerance build up that accompanies those type of drugs.  It doesn't work as well as those in the short term.  If you take one, it is not going to feel better 1 hour later.  I have found if you take them TID and stay on them they work. You don't think they are working as you still have moderate pain.  If you go off of them though, you have more severe pain.  I do not sleep as well on them.  I get up a lot though the night when I am on them.  This may be partially why my back does not hurt so much the next morning--I'm not lying down 8 hours sraight, but instead gettin up 2-3 times a night and stretching it out. They are addictive.  They definitely work on your seratonin.  But, like prozac, the dependance is not going to inhibit your ability to function or live a very productive life.  At first, they give you energy, which makes them appeal to the very ambitious person who has a lot of drive.  I think they  are over looking advantages of this drug to use in lieu of SRIs when zolofts or lexapros don't work on people.  They have been out about as long as those drugs, so we should have seen the long term affects that they have on people.  A psychiatrist would probably say I was out of my mind though.  I don't know.  So, if you have moderate anxiety or depression and back pain that is in the modrate to severe category, this drug, although controversial, may be the answer for you!!!Read More Read Less",4.0,"Disorder characterized by Stiff, Tender & Painful Muscles",2009

Tramadol,"Be very careful of Tramadol if you have ever been addicted to anything.  Contrary to what the drug company says, Tramadol is a synthetic opiate medication and is more habit-forming than hydrocodone if taken too long or in too large quantities.  I see Tramadol as a ""gateway"" drug to prescription drug abuse, sort of like marajuana is a gateway drug to illicit drug abuse.  I know it can help people, but just know the evil side of this drug.  I started taking it for pain and then I needed more and more (tolerance) and before I knew it, I was addicted.  I then advanced into Vicodin and Tramadol mixed, but fortunately am now getting treatment which has saved my life.

Tramadol,"I have multiple sclerosis.  I used to take narcotics but my doctor didn't like me taking them due to my age so he wanted me to try something else.  I was nervous because I seem to have bad reactions to a lot of medications and really have to stick with the fairly simple ones, not the newer ones.  Anyway, surprisingly, I was able to switch very comfortably from a relatively high dose of vicodin which I tried to stop but went through withdrawals, to the ultram.  Funny thing is, I was able to switch one to the other without any withdrawals.  SO, I am sure it attaches to the same receptors.  Anyway, it still worked just as good for my pain without the warm fuzzy feeling (but that's ok).  Not only that, but I had never been able to take antidepressants and I have always suffered from depression, but I can take the ultram and it has helped SO much.  It gave me pain relief and worked as an antidepressant when I couldn't take the SSRI's.  To me its a miracle drug, except one time when I lost the pills in hawaii.  Not only did I go through narcotic withdrawals, I also went through antidepressant withdrawals, I had aching, restless legs, severe depression, felt like I was crawling out of my skin, sweating and brain zaps,which were like electric jolts going through my head.  In addition, I have to wake up a little earlier then usual and take a tramadol then go back to sleep or I will wake up with withdrawals.  For me it works very well but is extremely addicting.  If I ever ran out, I am sure it would be worse for me then narcotic withdrawals but my doctor doesn't seem to think so, so I will just go with it.  It helps with my pain and depression.  Someday I would like to get off of it, but I don't know if I could simply because of the withdrawals.  It also gives me energy.  It seems to either work well for people or not at all.

Tramadol,"I've been taking tramadol 50mg tablets on and off for the past three years to help treat lower back pain (bulging L2/L3 with minor nerve damage), along with Aleve & Advil.  Tramadol is the only prescription pain med I've been prescribed that allows me to have relief from pain, and still be able to function and have a clear mind.  I have suffered the withdrawal symptoms that others described, but the key is to not take this medication on a daily basis. I've found that taking one or two days off every week is very helpful in avoiding any sort of negative withdrawal symptoms. On my ""off"" days I rely on Aleve, which is not enough to rid me of all my pain, but it's worth it knowing I won't suffer from any sort of physical/mental dependence on the tramadol.

Tramadol,"I have Parkinson's Disease and other neurological damage/disease. I lived with chronic, mind altering pain for years. I have recieved MScontin, OxyContin, Methadone, Dilaudid, Hydrocodone, gabapentin, Lyrica, Elavil, dextromethorphan, etc. This is as adjunctive medication in addition to Mirapex, dextroamphetamine sulphate, benztropine, and a list of dietary supplements. Of those, if suffering as I did, try rhodiola rosea, saffron, L-theanine. They have some efficacy. When a new neurologist suggested tramadol, I complied. The analgesic effects are outstanding for this type of pain, superior to any others I have tried. Years later it still works like the first time! Tramadol has no tolerance building effect, no doped up fogginess, and for me very little serotonergic withdrawal symptoms if I skip a few days. Tramadol does not cause opiod withdrawal. Period. Know the medication that you take and how it works. The slight opiate receptor agonism is so slight that I don't think it plays a significant role in its effectiveness. There is slight mood elevation similiar to a mild MDMA dose. That is all, no opiate-like high. I am so thankful for tramadol. Real pain = real relief. Read More Read Less",4.0,Pain,2009

Tramadol,"What I have to say is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!!! For anyone, especially, over 55 YEARS OLD, be VERY, VERY careful, as I have known 2(TWO) friends who had to use this medication(also known as ""ULTRAM"") and after they took even ONE of these pills, they immediately HAD TO LIE DOWN...they could not stay awake, at all, and not only that, but one of them was almost TOTALLY ""out of it"" and the other person said he slept for almost ""24 HOURS"" STRAIGHT!!!! THAT is how powerful this little pill is....especially among older people...seriously!!  Please be VERY careful! Personally, if I were you, I would not even take this medication! Instead, ask for even ""Hydrocodone 5mg"" or something similar! I do not know if younger people have had this experience, I, myself have not, but it definitely has a ""negative effect"" on many OLDER PEOPLE!!! So, PLEASE be careful! Most doctors do not even know the ""side effects"" of medications! If you need to know, the best person to ask is your ""Pharmacist!"" That is what they went to school for...specifically!!  Medications!! It can help others somewhat with pain but not really. Toramadol is ""similar"" to a ""narcotic"" like Hydrocodone or Oxycodone but is NOT an actual narcotic.

Tramadol,"My husband took this medicine and it worked well but every month he needed more, doubling every month. Since it is not controlled substance doctors will let you have a ton of it. My husband got to the point where he was filling RX every 9 days, and it is cheap so I had no idea how much he was taking, but I noticed that his behavior and personality changed. I started paying attention to dates on RX bottles and following claims in insurance website as well as walmart and other drug store websites that will give info. When confronted about abuse of meds he lied and was in denial and it got worse he started a drug seeking behavior and I found him getting narcotic RX from doctor, and then found med that he would not tell where they came from, I sent him to our PCP for intervention and possibly to be addmitted to rehab and packed his bags to move out until he got it under control. He did not have to be admitted and did go through withdrawls but did detox and today he is fine and will never take this medicine again. It took 3 months to become a serious problem and our doctor did not think this medicine caused such a problem, until I told him to read these reviews where other experienced same as what our family went through.

I could not tolerate the antidepressant therapies tried, so Tramadol is all I take.  I usually can get by with just 1 a day, but can increase to 2 a day if needed.  I have not experienced any of the bad effects I read in this forum.  One thing to always remember when reading these reviews.....each person is different with different problems. What works for one person, doesn't always help another.  For me, this works!  No drug therapy is perfect.

I also suffer from chronic depression and panic attacks for the last six years. I am taking cymbalta and when needed, Ativan. Although these meds help, I never felt quite 'normal', as I used to. When I started taking Tramadol, I instantly noticed a tremendous relief from anxiety. I felt energetic and motivated. It was as if I was born again. I had forgotten what it was like to make it through a day without panic attacks. I could think clearly, focus, and never felt sedated. When I talked to my doctor about this, he did not believe me and could not renew a prescription. I took only 50 mg a day.

It dulls the pain enough to make it tolerable, but the pain never completely goes away.  That has been fine for me.    The first few days I took it, I did have a little dizziness and some headaches, but they don't happen anymore.      I have found that this medication allows me to focus and work without a problem.  In fact, strangely enough, it actually makes me feel less anxious and happier--in a non-narcotic way.  It works like an anti-depressant, for me.      However, I do have to take it every 4 to 8  hours, depending on the level of pain.  I suppose it's worth it--I can't take aspirin or ibuprofen.    The downside of this medication is the horrible withdrawal side-effects I have experienced.  I have tried to quit taking this medication several times--just because I thought I might be taking it for too long--but it is next to impossible to reduce the medication and deal with the withdrawal problems when you have other things going on.  I know it will take a huge effort and a lot of time.    Honestly, if I had known how physically addictive it was, I don't know whether I would have started taking it.  As long as I keep some level of the medication in my bloodstream, I'm fine.  But, if I miss a dose or go longer than I should, those withdrawals remind me.  Sometimes I feel like a heroin addict.

It's really too bad that this med didn't work for me.  The docs swore it wasn't addicting but I absolutely disagree with this.  Overall, it worked fairly well on moderate pain, but when it was severe Tramadol didn't do the trick.  Perhaps rotating the medicine with another pain med would allow me to use it.

Tramadol,"addictive, brutal withdrawal=insomnia + restless legs, agitation!! but yes it works better than most narcs for me. and it's not a narc and is relatively transparent. the problem comes(probably like most pain meds) when it's effectivness decreases and you up dosage. and then you need to back off so as not to take too much. and you end up in a kind of hot/cold cycle. well, maybe just a warm/cold cycle. be careful, though. doctors hand it out like candy just because of it's no narc rating.",3.0,Pain,2009

Your energy levels go way down from this and it is difficult to exercise to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  Also, the drug is very addicting for me.

Tramadol,"I've been taking Tramadol daily for severe endometriosis (2 surgeries already, another 1 scheduled this month) as prescribed for years. I was also intermittently taking Percocet for breakthrough pain at the onset of menstruation and after surgery. However, I chose to discontinue taking Percocet even when offered (as it worked most effectively) because I believed Tramadol was a safer option. I want to make clear that I have never been addicted to anything, in fact, I don't even drink. That being said, Tramadol is highly addictive! While I have never had a euphoric feeling nor have I exhibited drug-seeking behavior; if I had forgotten my script or had neglected to pick it up before the pharmacy closed, horrendous withdrawl would immediately set in. I have done extensive research on opiates and opiate-acting drugs and the literature on Tramadol is extremely misleading. If you are taking this drug for long-term pain relief and hope to eventually stop, please do it slowly or you WILL feel the effects and they are very unpleasant. They are very similar to the withdrawl symptoms of the most highly-addictive opiates; restlessness, anxiety, loss of energy, cold sweats, tremors, diarrhea and so on... Just be careful and know that you are tricking your brain into thinking that you've taken an opiate so when you stop, your brain will crave that ""opiate."" Some have said the Tramadol withdrawl is worse than that of stronger, narcotic pain-relievers because unlike its opiate cousin, it contains an element that elevates your serotonin (hence the ""speedy,"" overly content feeling) which plummets once stopped adding to the already low, uneasy feeling. I hope this will help some of you with your decision to continue Tramadol (10 days or more).

NO!If you're looking into drug before filling your prescription then it's not too late for you to ask dr for something else. I fell into my husband's arms-luckily not the concrete at an amusement park and suffered another seizure and unconciousness.  Ended up in ER again.  That's it.  No more.  Have stopped takind it since last Saturday. Told doctor I can't take it anymore.  The only reason I made it through the week without severe withdrawl is because I had vicodin to take.  Isn't that ironic that the narcotic helped me get off the non-narcotic without withdrawl.  Should be the other way.  Just trust me I've been taking for so long and can take so much thats why I had the seizure. Eventually you'll probably have a reaction- maybe not a seizure, but addiction, withdrawl inevitable.

When I try to stop, the DT's hit and the pain, terror, anxiety, nausea, chills, hotflashes, mass cramps, etc. for about a week and then another week to get your strength back. It can be a very scary drug. Legitimate pain and need for pain meds and then addiction to compound it. Just be super careful. I will be in this vicious circle for many more years.

The only downsides are the crash u get when you wait too long for the next doese  and withdrawals. The withdrawals are bad enough to kill you. I stopped taking it when I got pregnant and had to be hospitalized for a week and be put on IV stadol to get rid of withdrawals. I stopped taking it again when I could no longer afford it  and ended up in the hospital again. I had migraines, severe panic attacks, I lashed out at my kids and actually hated them.

It helps me eat without worring too much about pain from crohn's flareups.    HOWEVER, this med is just as addicting as other narcotic pain releavers. And i know a lot of you out there are hearing your doc say ""ultram is not as addicting as narcotics, they are better, with less side effects.""    WRONG! I have been on ultram for 7 years. If I don't eat without it, my stomach feels horrible. When you do use it, you might sweat a little or a TON! If I stop taking it, i feel depressed and agrivated. Why is this?    Unlike narcotics, ultram actually effects mood. It has targets for ""happiness recepters"" built right in with the ones for ""pain recepters"". So, if you are no longer taking ultram, your mood changes for the worse. Taking ultram after week or month long breaks, I will feel more energetic and content.    For those of you with severe pain; ultram is not for you. For my surgeries (2 bowl resections, hip replacement, perirectal abcess with fistula) I managed my pain with IV dilaudid at the hospital (which works wonders, yet fades within 2 to 3 hours), and oxycotin's, more for long term relief.     DON'T GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ULTRAM AND ANY OTHER TYPE OF PAIN RELIEVER. In the hospital, they gave me IV dilaudid and ultram inbetween shots to help the IV last longer. Durring this time i experienced a seizsure like sensation, shaking uncontrollably in my bed and almost blacking out. At home, I took some oxy's followed by ultram and had simular problems. to be safe, let a few weeks or even a month pass when switching back to ultram from higher pain meds.    ULTRAM IS JUST AS ADDICTIVE AS NARCOTIC PAIN KILLERS, YET WON'T WORK ON SEVERE PAIN. DO NOT USE WITH NARCOTICS DUE TO CHANCE OF SEIZSURES.

Tramadol,"I was on Tramadol for over 2 years due to Lupus, fibromyalgia and arthritis. The med worked really good for me! A few side effects occured Occasional constipation, mood swings, sexual side effects, would get cold chills when I missed a dose, occasional migraine, etc. Overall I thought this med was great in helping to deal with my pain until I decided to get off the med. It was one of the worst things to ever happen to me!! This drug is very ADDICTIVE!!! I had a really hard time trying to get off of this med. I experienced all the withdrawl symptoms that you might get while taking a narcotic... Cold chills, sweats, anxiety, rigors, diarrhea, tremors, could not sleep, could not eat, nausea, etc. I've been off this med now for 1 week and I don't think I would ever get back onto this med without seriously thinking about it. I'd rather find a different way to deal with my daily pains than to deal with the side effects of getting off this med. Its GREAT if used as a short term relief but not if used as a long term relief!Read More Read Less",4.0,Pain,2008

Tramadol,"Here's the deal with Tramadol, folks.  It can be a miracle drug for one person and a complete waste of time for another.  Many people report poor results and they blame the drug, when they should be blaming their own body chemistry.  I am in the miracle drug category.  Thanks to Tramadol, I am now able to live pain free (Extremely rare testicular disorder requiring several surgeries).  If you are looking for the euphoria or pain relief recieved from traditional opiate agonists, you're barking up the wrong tree.  That being said, it does provide a mild sense of contentment and serenity(probably due to the fact that you're no longer in pain). Additionally, Tramadol does not impair cognitive functions like their opiate cousins.  For me, the most common side effects include: Mild constipation, sleeplessness, and mild upset stomach.  Never take over 400mg in one 24 hour period!!!!  The risk of seizure or other severe reaction increases immensely when you exceed this dose.  Many of the people on this message board obviously take the drug at incorrect doseages.  If your someone who needs powerful opiates a la oxycodone, this drug will probably be a big letdown.  If you are like me, and prefer the joy that comes with critical thinking (even if a little pain is involved) to the mind-numbing dopiness of traditional opiates, then Tramadol can be a lifesaver.

Meloxicam,"Every couple years I'll get intense throbbing pain in my right shoulder (a bursitis flareup). This usually begins within a day or so of doing some physical work where I'm reaching up and turning/pulling/pushing on something. I've even had it happen for no more reason than putting something up on a closet shelf. It's possible that a car accident or other sports injury did some damage to that joint that wasn't immediately obvious back in my youthful years.    In my midlife years, the doc would give me shot of cortisone in there and that provided instant pain relief. I was good to go for another 5 years or so. However, we're all aware of potential issues with cortisone injections.     I'm now in my early 60's and (thankfully) still in relatively good shape. About five years ago when this flared up, I went to the local urgent care office and there was a sports doc on duty that day. I gave her the history and she suggested I try one daily 15mg pill of ""Meloxicam"" (ie. generic form of ""Mobic""). In a matter of 24 hours the pain subsided. In three days the pain was totally gone. I usually take one more pill on the 4th day just for good measure, then I put the bottle away until the next time I need it. For me and my issue, this med works where 2400mg of Ibuprofen or 150mg of Tramadol daily provided no relief whatsoever.    I've found that this product has a very good shelf life when stored securely in a dry area (away from children of course). My current bottle will be four years old next month and after two years of storage, I used it successfully again earlier this week. I take it with a large glass of water.

I was amazed after three days the improvement. After one week I would never know the problem ever existed! It also took care of all my other aches and pains! I have been on it for about a month. I am 50 years old and in good health otherwise. My doctor told me I could take it as long as I needed it. She is an excellent doctor so I trust her judgment. But because of the possible side effects I take it every other day now that a lot of the inflammation is gone. If I go two days I can feel it start to come back. I feel for this drug to work it needs to be taken constant on a set schedule. It does no good to take it and all of the inflammation goes away and then stop for it just to return full force. I feel it does your body better to find a safe dose and keep the joint inflammation to a minimum.  I have had no side effects from this drug.

I sought out several different specialists for answers, who ruled out many possibilities &/or gave diagnoses which led to more questions.  Finally some symptoms have been helped, but the discovery that my creatinine level was too high caused my primary care doctor to suspect the meloxicam as the problem.

The Meloxicam took all of the stiffness and pain away, but I get a skin rash about once every 2 weeks which requires treatment at home, and I have experienced vertigo and dizziness a lot. Also, I was unaware that loss of balance was part of the side effects that others have when taking the medicine. I have fallen down approx 8 times in the last 6 months. If I lose my balance at all, I'm headed for the ground. Even today I didn't notice a single step down which most of us would stumble a little and catch our balance. I didn't even have a chance to stumble, I went straight to the ground and jammed my hadn and hurt my knee. I have an excellent tolerance for pain, yet the falls have been so dramatic that I went to the Emergency room. If this is truly a side effect, then I must stop taking it immediately. I have always been athletic and well coordinated and the falling is not only embarrasing but it really hurts and I'm heading toward a serious head or shoulder injury.

Methocarbamol,"I had a discectomy 2020 S1L5, and following surgery I knew I would need a couple injections twice a year to manage the pain! With PT 2 x weekly, the pain has been under control, however long term I knew that I really wanted to be rid of the pain, which I found out, wouldn't happen. I would need the injections which could possibly  last 3-6 months. In the meantime, I put off the injections because the pain was not that severe and my doctor advised me to come in when it is, due to wanting to make sure the injections worked to get rid of the pain. I was put on 750mg of Methocarbamol 3 x a day, but I have never taking it as directed. I have been taking 1 tab 2 maybe 3 times a week and it helps. My only concern is, since I have been taking it, my left shoulder has this weird pain with movement. If I move my shoulder towards the back as if im stretching, I get this pain that paralyzes my arm and I use my right arm to help secure it back to a regular position, but the pain lingers and I have to be careful with how I move it moving forward. I do take other meds for HBP, but the doctors knows that.

I have suffered from severe chronic low back and leg pain, cramps, and spasm in my legs and abdomen since 1995 following a helo accident while a Marine in 1980, and I've had pain in my life for over 37 years.

Then pain in ankle which wasn't there before.Three hours later I also started noticing a feeling of warmth in my right shoulder.I also felt nausea and stomach discomfort. When I took the second dose at night I started noticing body chills and body jerking so I turned up the furnace even though it was only 50 degrees outside that kinda stopped it.Then I went to bed when I woke up at around 5AM to use the bathroom. I was so dizzy and lightheaded and I couldn't walk straight. When I was standing still I felt like I couldn't stand still because it felt like the whole room was spinning. I almost fell if I didn't hold on to the wall I would've fell. Every time I walked I felt I was going to either bump into the wall or fall.

Methocarbamol,"Started gagging this medication down in March of 2015, my pharmacy (Walmart)has 2 suppliers, both make the same non coated pill. If it even touches the back of your tongue you will be chasing something, anything to get the taste out of your mouth, OMG it is so nasty. I have had 6 spinal surgeries over the course of 25 years and this is by far the worst medication I have ever taken as far as taste. It does a moderate job of relaxing muscles and a very poor job of stopping muscle spasms. I take a prescribed dose of several medications to treat muscle spasms and I take non prescribed supplements, pot and mag to try and stop the spasms. If you have had spams in your feet and calves, upper back, lower back you know how painful and how hard to stop the spams can be once they start. Good luck to anyone taking this medicine.

EFFECTS - Generally getting good relief from 2 extra-strength acetaminophen+methocarbamol caplets; however, my upper back, chest, face and neck have all been incredibly itchy since I started the medication 3 days ago.   The face and neck areas in particular feel a bit puffy, though not alarmingly so. Skin feels a little rough there, too.  The occasional flushing that occurs is intensely prickly and can get rather painful and uncomfortable, though it only lasts about a second.  I have taken Tylenol/acetaminophen in the past and have had no allergic reaction to it, so I assume this is all caused by the methocarbamol.  Experienced no other side effect.Read More Read Less",3.0,Other,2012

Methocarbamol,"Two days after taking this muscle relaxer, I began to experience a change in mental state, increased heart rate, and became shaky. I consulted my pharmacist of these side effects because my doctir was unavailable. He said that it was nothing he had ever heard of before and that it was one of the least sedadtive relaxers on the market. Bear in mind the only thing I take on a rwegular basis is omega 3, b complex, and standard multi vitamin. I am twent four years old, no addictipon other than tobacco. No prescriptions. I usually only go to the doctor annually for a physical and blood work. During my visit I explained the side ffects I had been experiencing.I handed over the RX bottle that contained twenty six pills, out of 30 total originally (after three days). Still in extreme discomfort mind you, I asked if there another option. I know the problem of growing popularity on the streets have doctors on edge about writing prescriptions.. I was treated as a Junkie. The pills were counted, placed back in the bottle, then I was asked to return with the pills after three days and let him know if I were still experincing these symtoms. Why do that? I had already stopped taking, and experiencing these things. I simply replied that I was not taking them with me, and walked out never again asking for a medication IE Flexaril, oxycodone, or any other popular street med. After research I find an elder man had these same symtoms in 2008, this is an issue. one that should be addressed.

Unfortunately, with age - people tend to add more disease diagnoses, more meds and maintenance meds often lose their effectiveness over the years. Yet there is so little emphasis on mental illness (Why?!) ... that newer, more effective meds, treatments or surgeries just don't exist.  At least not in this country!  Xanax remains the premium, most effective treatment. Yet, the stigma still persists in an ignorant place.  Our gov't keeps making these meds (not drugs!) more costly and harder for patients to access.  ""Show your ID!"" Fewer, if any refills, etc.  Just because ""some people"" abuse drugs - does NOT make it OK to threaten, harass, punish or make it more difficult for (patients!) through no fault of their own - to obtain the meds they NEED for their dx. condition.  ""Tricyclics"" (in the 80's) were the only meds I was ever prescribed that worked for me better than Xanax or any anti-depressants ... they worked well!

Have a discussion with your doctor about a plan on how long you will be on it, a plan to taper off it, and a long term plan to deal with your anxiety. Xanax is a band aid and it has serious side effects. Anyone who says it doesnâ??t is a flat out liar. It messes with your memory for starters. You build up a tolerance quickly and will need a higher dose to get your desired effect. Once you have taken enough for long enough you canâ??t just stop taking it. You can have seizures and die.

Ambein is effective if I use 18.25 mg). Xanax works quite well with 4 mg. If I want more than 4-5 hours sleep I take 12.5 mg Ambein with 2 mg of Xanax. I end up using various combinations of these medications because most doctors freakout at the prospect of habituation. One doctor told me at 66 years old I should take Xanax as little as possible so I get .5 mg tabs and take every other day. Like this is supposed to do something? .5 mg has no effect on occasional anxiety. I use Librium 25 mg on jet flights for anxiety and it works fine.

Alprazolam,"I started with alprazolam .5 ER a week ago,and I cannot express enough the tremendous difference between the ER and regular medication. The effectiveness of extended-release is crucial to battle generalized anxiety, because it's something that lasts ALL DAY; not just an hour or so. I had previously suffered my day-to-day routine at work and basically kept my head down and avoided eye contact- even with my family. Now, in the past week I have noticed my behavior change drastically in the sense that I'm not fearful to walk down a hallway, be in a crowded store,sit at a red light with other cars; and the list goes on. I went shopping with my boyfriend the past weekend and was amazed when I caught myself joking around with two women behind us in line and then another woman in the parking lot.(Both conversations that I actually initiated) That spirit has been gone for years now and is finally coming back. I don't feel angry anymore and most importantly (to me at least) I don't feel that overly calm- almost numb feeling from taking a regular alprazolam.

If you are looking into getting on Alprazolam do not forget you can become addicted to it very easily. Other than my tolerance which formed very rapidly, the effects also are very short term. More so for people who have panic ""episodes"" not PTSD or paranoid induced anxiety like I do 24/7. It is a very good medicatiom though when used properly, which,  like I said is hard considering it's short lastig effects.

I was sent to see a stomach specialist, since they were clueless. My wife called the new Dr. to talk to him he looked at my medical records that had been faxed to him, called my wife back a little ticked and told her that I was having major panic attacks and called in Xanax. I had taken over 15 different medications prescribed to fix all the different conditions I had been diagnosed with. The Dr told me that the meds. had been making my condition worse,to get a lawyer and he would actually go to court with me since he was tired of all the patients he got that were misdiagnosed and over medicated, I had never had a doctor say something like that, but he was as I found out a real Dr., not a pill pusher for the drug Co's.whose favorite show is Dr House. I was not told about the serious withdrawals of Xanax,nor how many things can cause Xanax not to work.I think breathing filtered air has the least side effects, slightly ahead of mountain spring water. ALSO BEWARE If you take narcotic pain meds. for chronic pain daily and Xanax,around 50% of people who go through sudden withdrawal from both at once die. Oh yeah, great to know Doc. I had to find on the Net. I had an operation that left me permanently disabled and in constant pain. I have to temporarily put up with a Dr who thinks most people are just there for the drugs.

I would panic while driving, and also panic at work and in most social situations. I also became afraid of being alone. I knew this was not normal, and my doctor and I knew that the medication was having an adverse effect on me. Several physicans and a therapist told me that they would not consider Alprazolam to be a recommended daily treatment for anxiety.. it does work, and it can be part of a treatment plan, although it's more of a med for when you actually have the anxiety attack.

Alprazolam,"i have been taking xanax for over a year now. it has been a life saver for me. i suffered from frequent and severe anxiety attacks for over 6 months before i started taking it. I take 1 mg 4xs daily with 10 mg of buspar 2xs daily. i know xanax can be addictive but i would be crawling out of my skin without it. My personal and professional relationships have improved greatly. instead of being overwhelmed and obsessed with my own problems i can now care about others. Before trying this I tried 4 different antidepressents and had horrible side effects from all of them. I lost two jobs due to the antidepressents. They caused everything from irrational actions and thoughts to an almost""zombie"" like existence. The possibility of being adddicted to this is a small price to pay for how much my life has changed for the better.I have grown a tolerance to xanax which is why my doctor added the buspar. so far so good. I've been taking the buspar for about 3 months now. it take about 6 weeks to take full effect.sometimes i get a bit of drowsiness after i take the buspar but it goes away within about 20 min. it just makes the xanax more effective for me. This is a combo that works for me wonderfully but everyone is different. It took about six months of trial and error before my doc and i found what works for me.

Alprazolam,I don't what I really think about this medication. I will say for people who get full on panic attacks it is gold in a pill form. I used to hyperventilate to the point of almost passing out. But I stopped having panic attacks and I'm 26 now and had them from roughly age 22-23 then a few more throughout the years. But let's say I take it for general aniexty-a family issue arrises-etc it usually-no matter what strenght causes me to black out in a sense. I most often can't recolect any activity I do after taking 1mg of xanax. So I personally only realy keep it on hand for full on panic attacks and when I know I'll be home safe. But I want to warn ne1 who reads this -I know over a dozen people my age who have stolen from me for these pills. Their full on junkies with xanax. It's sad.

Alprazolam,"I watched my mom suffer with paralyzing panic attacks until her death.  She would not go to the doc. She died from heart failure and emphysemia. I had my 1st immobilizing attack at age 17.  It scared me but didn't happen again for 10 years, 3 weeks after the birth of my 1st child.  I was giving him a bath and suddenly I was overcome with fear.  I started sweating,    I knew something terrible was about to happen and I couldn't move or speak.  My father was a doctor and when I could move I called him and he suggested I go the next day to my doctor.  He told me that anxiety disorders can be inherieted and that I most likely got the gene from my mom.  I tried bio feedback and several other non-rx attempts at controlling these dibilitating episodes.  I found a psychiatrist who suggested I try short acting ativan for use when I would have an attack.  The frequency of attacks was 10+ a week.  By the time I took the pill and waited for it to take effect, I had gone through the worst part of the attack and was almost back to normal.  I didn't find this very helpful.  My doc. told my about the extended release form when it became available and it changed my life. I still experience some situational anxiety and take a short acting med. if needed, but the paralyzing events are a memory now.  Its like the medication in my blood stream is ready and stops the BAD panic attacks from becoming full blown.  I just hope my insurance will keep this on the formulary.  I do not experience any adverse side effects at all.  In fact I get out more and am overall more relaxed because I have stopped wondering when the next attack will come.  I feel I have control now.

I remember nothing of what I was doing, even eating out with family and watching a movie. And withdrawls are brutal-NO cold turkey. Work with your doctor to wean off. I still take-with caution and control because they are the only ones that help me control my life and stay focused. Main word there-focused.

I started off taking it here-and-there when the panic attacks started, but then I started taking it on a daily basis about 10 months ago - almost to prevent any anxiousness and that seemed helpful and like it was a smart thing to do (my doctor prescribed me 1mg 3xday if necessary -- and I was just taking 1mg so I didn't think I was going overboard with it).  And up until a month or so ago, I was taking it daily.  HOWEVER - I started to realize that I have been gaining weight (about 15lbs in the last 8-10 months), which has added to my problems with depression/anxiety.  So I started taking less and less.  I get pretty annoying headaches, and have had some trouble sleeping at night.  I don't necessarily feel addicted to it - but I'm to the point where I've been taking this ""quick fix"" drug daily and relying on it to solve my problems.  But really - from what I've read about it - it's not a good drug to stay on for a long period of time, so I think it's good to have on hand for the panic attacks, but I wouldn't get into the habit of taking it daily - it's pretty annoying to stop taking.Read More Read Less",4.3,Repeated Episodes of Anxiety,2009

Alprazolam,I was told I have General Anxiety Disorder. I was prescibed Alprazolam. I have been taking it for almost a year and my body have slowly built a dependence. I started at .5 mg and now up to almost 4mg.  Now if I don't take it I suffer from withdrawal. I have lost interest in mostly everything. I wake up early feeling like I want to jump out of my skin. Sometimes I have horrible nightmares. Days seem just to mesh. I have family support and my doctor is trying to slowly ween me off but it doesnt seem to help. I find myself thinking and rationalizing constantly about everything. I have trouble getting thoughts out verbally without studdering. I wonder if my doctor really understands what this drug does long term. It helped in the beginning but now its my new anxiety. I suggest before you use this drug to make sure its monitored very carefully. The side effects are horrible if you reduce it just a small amount (at least in my case). I wish I had taken another type of treatment non-drug related! I hope this helps anyone so they dont fall into the same trap this drug puts you in long term.Read More Read Less,3.7,Repeated Episodes of Anxiety,2009

I was jittery, tired a lot, clenching my teeth often, neck pain, short tempered.  I also never felt depressed, so I didn't really believe it was a mental issue.  I tried all the SNRI's and they did absolutely nothing.  I tried Alprazolam but due to it's short half life I had to take it three times a day which was a pain and made me feel like I was on a mood roller coaster.  I am now on the extended release 3mg a day.  It has pretty much eliminated all the symptoms except the constant need for a nap.  I also notice my short term memory and attention span suffer.  I am very concerned about what I have read about long term use and withdrawal symptoms.  I have been taking it about two months, and if I forget to take even one day's pill, I get so jittery that I cannot keep my eyes closed.  I cannot stop talking, and cannot keep one thought in my head for more than a few seconds. I get horrible mood swings.

I think a better solution would be to refer him to a psychiatrist to address the real problem and give him medication that could really help him instead of just making him go to sleep.  I understand panic attacks are scary because I see what he goes thru when he has one, but I also think someone that is qualified should help him address his problems.

Alprazolam,"I have been taking them since late winter. I'm sure if your here you already know about anxiety. Skipped school, horrible insomnia, and I also have a visual disorder from previous illicit drug use that is made worse by anxiety.    Some days, the anxiety would get so bad I really felt crazy. I had to break down what every person I saw look at me was thinking by their expressions. Much worse was how exaggerated/unrealistic it was, and how it didn't really matter anyways.    The doctor was a little reluctant to give me the medication (I felt like), admitting being a previous drug abuser. She did though, thankfully. I told her I only wanted the drugs on a as needed basis. I was against SSRI's or MAOI's because I've heard from people that it's made many worse, and some suicidal.    Not that it helps I am a big person and asked for a more moderate dose of 2 mg after a couple weeks.    So far so good. There are weeks that I need to take it everyday, and then I'll be fine for a month or so and not even think about taking any.    The anxiety is a funny thing though, feeling as if I don't really deserve them. I break it down into: What is the point at which I need medication? Anxiety can not kill you. But neither can a headache, what point do I ask for help? Probably the point at which I am not sleeping, or going to school, and my relationships are hurting because of it. But I constantly try to talk myself down for it.    But the medication helps me relax a good deal. In the initial few weeks I took it, I almost had a panic attack just from the anxiety of take the pill itself.    I have been addicted to drugs before, and personally am a strong willed person. The doctor told me she didn't want me to get addicted. Withdraw from alprazolam can be fatal. Literally. But so far so good. No urge to use the drug when not needed at all.

Alprazolam,"I had panic disorder and agoraphobia for a year before trying this at 0.25 mg as-needed. It immediately relieved my anxiety enough to allow me to leave my home and go out again with no side effects. I much prefer it over SSRIs such as Zoloft and Lexapro, which left me feeling 10 times worse than before. Those left me drained and lifeless--just not worth it. I take 0.25 mg of this whenever I start to feel anxious and feel an attack coming on, and it keeps me sustained without making me feel drugged and I do not have an attack. This medication carries a bad stigma because too many people abuse it and ruin it for those that actually need it. If you follow the prescription and don't self-medicate by upping your dosage without a doctor's consent, you should not experience any problems. But because too many people abuse it, doctors are now reluctant to prescribe it which is a shame because it does wonders for people like me who got so bad they couldn't even leave the house. Many say therapy is a better alternative, but not everyone lives in a town big enough to have many of those options--I've seen 3 counselors and all of them were worth nothing. I just take this medication with me wherever I go and take it as-needed. Sometimes I go days without even using it. So here's my advice: it's better than feeling lifeless on SSRIs. Follow the prescription. Don't up your dose or abuse it. If you do that, you shouldn't have problems. Sometimes I feel a little confused or dizzy after taking it, but it also depends on when I ate and other factors. I highly recommend this for people in my situation.Read More Read Less",5.0,Panic Disorder,2008

For years it was difficult to find a balance because I wasn't depressed, I just had extreme anxiety... esp. in social settings such as ball games, work events, etc. I would have panic attacks out of no where! Over the years, with close observation from my Dr., my dose has been increased- now at 2mg 1x a day. We have talked about me going down in dosage b/c I worry about my future and my body becoming use to the drug.

My only question or concern is that sometimes when I don't take it at night, it's very hard to fall asleep!  I was up to 6am the other morning because my mind wouldn't shut down.

Whenever I experience anxiety during the day, I just take a tablet and it helps sooo much with my interactions with others.

As well as 1x Dilaudid 4mg for breakthrough pain (every 4 hours / as needed). 1x 350mg Soma & 1x 15mg Restoril (at bedtime).  Don't be surprised if you need Milk of Magnesia on the morphine, because it will cause constipation.    I have been on many combinations / doses of different medicines over the years, and this combo works the best so far, with the morphine being the main part of the regimen.

Morphine,"Started with PCP suggesting MS Contin as alternative to the long list of drugs that were tried and had failed.  My neuropathy gives me a pain rating of 5 to 9, on a 24/7 basis.  The 30mg dose, 3 times daily, actually reduced the pain rating by 2 or 3 on the hgih end, and with Lortab for breakthrough, we had finally found a drug that, though not perfect, did better than anything else in the formulary.  After a few years, the effectiveness lowered, and the PCP doubled the dose to 60mg x 3, and 4 years later, again I reported overall pain levels increasing, and at that time, one year ago, she raised the dose to 100mg x 3.  I was hesitant to accept this last doseage increase, as the respiratory system can be depressed with opioid use, and breathing has always been high on my list of things to do.  However, with pain that can be so severe that I would be brought to tears many times a day, and unable to sleep for mone than an hour or two at a time, I did take the increase.  Each time, after a short adjustment period when I felt the ""euphoric"" side effects, that part went away, and the MS-C went back to doing an adequate job of reducing the severity of my pain.  My advice:  Don't ask for increases in doseage.  Stick  with describing the pain you are feeling, and allow your PCP to determine the best way to handle it.  If you have a good doctor who is familiar with your problem(s), and is sensitive to the same, he/she help  you decide how to best manage your pain.Read More Read Less",3.7,Pain,2011

The only problem I have with MSContin is the constipation it causes.  Miralax seems to work the best to relieve the constipation.  Also, it is necessary for me to take 10mg Percocets to help with breakthrough pain several times a day when the pain spikes.  Aside from constipation, my only other criticism of MSContin is that it takes a long time to start working.  If I am late taking my pill and my pain level gets worse, the MSContin takes about 90 minutes before it ""kicks in"".

Although I am about to switch from the MS to Methadone simply because it's more cost effective.   Anyway I'm rambling... A lot of you are asking for advice as far as your nasal spray. They make an oxycodone NSL if that's the delivery method you need. The best thing is to be open and honest w your Dr. And to find yourself a good one. We may require opioid meds but we still deserve the right treatment plan just like anyone else. For people out there not in the know Methadone is very effective as a pain killer and cheaper retail than most meds w a co-pay. It gets expensive when you truly are in chronic pain.

Morphine,"I have been using morphine 100 mg tablets for nearly 10 years now and have had only mild problems with constipation.  After the effectiveness of other pain meds (vicodin, percocet, etc.) kept needing increasing amounts of the drug to keep the pain at bay, my pain clinic doctors had me evalutated at a hospital and started me on 60 mg tabs used in conjunction with Fentanyl patches.  After using this combination for a year, I had to drop the Fentanyl patches because I had reached the max allowable payout for this med after 10 months into the year.  My doctor's then decided to put me on morphine 100 mg tabs 3 times a day.  At first I had severe constipation, but never did I feel the brain fog others have warned me about.  I find myself able to use less than 3 tabs a day at times, and I am glad not to have to worry about changing patches every third day because I used to forget and would become ill, not remembering that I had to change a patch to prevent myself from going into detox.  I have been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including Multiple Sclerosis (which causes severe nerve pain in my legs, neck and shoulders, Fibro Myalgia, and have had several injuries to my neck and spine which no neuro-surgeon has ever wanted to touch because of the locations and severity of the problems.

Morphine,"I firmly believe there has to be a solution out there other than drugs to take care of my pain.  I considered back surgery, but I have heard good and bad stories about it.  I have been in chronic pain since 1987, and my tolerance to it is getting worse, and the pain is getting worse.  With modern medicine,isn't there something out there to get to the source of the problem?  All I want to do is walk into the grocery store and be able to walk more than one aisle without hurting.  Depression kicked in many years ago, but I am fighting the fight.  Unfortunately, the pain is winning.  I have done physical therapy, going to the gym,  chiropratics, accupunture, VaxD treatments, fibromyalgia treatments, epiderals, you name it, but needles are not my thing.  Nothing worked.  The morphine takes the edge off the pain, and I force myself to work through my desk job to pay our bills, but fighting pain all day long is a losing battle.  I wanted to give up, and my doctor put me on antidepressant medications.  It helped, but the weight kept piling on.  After years of taking those, I weaned myself off, with my doctor's help, and lost 17 pounds the first month.  I find myself crying, but the extra weight hurt my back more; so, I am going to try fighting without those drugs.  If I need to go back on them, oh well; I guess I'd better, but for now, no antidepressants.  I just keep praying that our good Lord will give someone the knowledge to correct major back problems.

I can't even load the dishwasher without being in tears. All I can say is that without this med the pain would be unbearable all the time. I have a great doctor who knows that I am in pain all the time and recognizes the need. I am hopeful to all of you out there still searching that you will give this a chance. My doctor wanted to put me on this med and I refused due to concerns of addiction etc. But keep in mind, the Tylenol in Vicoden and Norco is worse than this medication. For those taking the instant release, try the extended release as it does last longer. Good luck to all of you searching for help and relief! God bless you and our troops!

Morphine,"I have a ""Non-fixable"" back due to injuries inccured in the war. I've been on so many meds I can't even remember them all. Right now among many more, I'm on 160mg of Morphine 3x a day.  It's sad to say but as high as the dosage is, it gets me out of bed. Although I know I will NEVER be pain free, this medicine has helped a lot better than others like the Fentanyl patch! Depending on your dosage no matter how much fiber or water your drink you WILL have some constipation. I've fixed mine with over the counter MIRALAX. It really works. One major thing about Morphine is NEVER and I mean NEVER miss a dose or stop taking it because you will go into withdrawl symptoms compaired to a heroin addict. Trust me it only happend to me a few times and it's NOT PRETTY!! Overall, if you have constant pain Morhpine is a very good sustained relief drug.

Morphine,"I tore my acl and patella back in '04. I was seeing my primary care Dr. (bad healthcare organization) and was very undermedicated. A previous Dr. had me taking a total of 40 mg of percocet a day (oxycodone and tylenol). When I started with KP, the Dr. only gave me 20 mg a day, reluctant like many Dr's to give pain meds. Despite walking around on torn ligaments, because of my age at the time (25), everyone kept telling me ""I was too young to have so many health issues"". I was then placed on a NINE month wait period for surgery. In the meantime I was reffered to pain management. That was the best thing that happened because of the Dr's knowledge and understanding of chronic pain. Started taking 30 mg morphine er 2x a day. After the 1st surgery, the hospital lost ALL of the film, AND surgical reports. My knee was 10x worse after the botched surgery than before. Now, 3 years and 2 more corrective surgeris later the meds have been upped to 500mg of morphine er and 40mg of percocet a day, and a home electrical stim machine.  The moral of my story is GET A GOOD DOCTOR! Anyone experiencing chronic pain should go to a pain specialist immeadiatly. I tolerate the dose well now that it's been almost 4 yrs. The one thing that bothers me every time I have to get my refills is the STIGMA that these meds carry.

I have lost 40 pounds, I have left my high stress job as an over the road trucker, I have learned to say no to other people and do what is best for me and I  Have made other dietary changes.. I allow myself to have one cup of coffee in the morning and no other caffeine. I have also released my sugar consumption and gone gluten and dairy free.  I honestly think if I had not quit gluten I would be disabled today. I think the best thing we can all do is find a good doctor who will listen to our concerns and not run us through the mill.  The last time I saw my cardiologist he was literally in the room with me for 3 minutes. I do not consider this quality of care care and I am going to find someone else i do not consider this quality of care  and I am going to find someone else. I wish you all the best.Read More Read Less",3.3,Rapid Ventricular Heartbeat,2022

Metoprolol Tetrate,"After reading the most helpful rated experiences people reported and how other people approved those reviews/experiences there are 2 common themes. Depression and Doctors who won't listen. I'm on 200mg a day and have been for over 9 years. One doctor told me flat out, ""your alternative is death"". In regards to stopping. ""Disease"" puts us in these positions,  not the meds and if you are like me or close then you have more meds than just this? But ""Death"" is my alternative as my Doc said, so perspective gives me a different outlook when put that way?   I just completed a 2 mile hike over very rugged turf, Pickle Springs Conservation Area in Missouri. I carried a camera and lens, water the whole way. I have survived 10 heart attacks, mini-strokes, a cabbage the Docs call them, since 2005 and had over 11 stents placed. I got better...lot's of verticals to climb btw..  This is important to know. I can do things at 65+ I couldn't do 5 years ago or even 15 years ago without experiencing serious repercussions. Today I can pace myself, I have better stamina and endurance and I don't work out at all, just walk when I can. There's no way anyone can convince me that it hasn't provided me a better quality of life - I am living proof.

Metoprolol Tetrate,"All my life my heart has been beating very quickly, like I'd been lightly jogging. It was something I just kept to myself & thought it was normal. 01/19/13 I got the H1N1 Influenza Virus which rendered me completely helpless. I was incubated in the ER, about 3 days later my throat was sliced for a tracheotomy. For 4 Months I was on a ventilator. The DRs would temporarily take me out of my medical induced coma for a time, I would attempt to talk to my Niece, garbled noised to her, clear messages to me. I'd hear her respond she couldnt Understand me. I'd cry when she left in the daytime to sleep because she would stay by my side all night. After 6 weeks I was flown to a specialty facility which specialized in patients with lung problems. Because my heartrate would skyrocket when I was moved when my bedding was changed I was put on Metoprolol. I was a comfortable 180 pounds, I knew I needed to release at least 50 lbs before the virus, but between May 5, 2013 when I was released to June 2016 I gained exactly 100 lbs. I knew I had to do something. I talked to my DR about being serious about losing the weight. So a dietician got involved with my weightloss. So far since October 2016 to today I have released 69 lbs. I'm down to 211lbs despite still taking metoprolol. I plan on keeping going with the 10,000K steps a day walking on my treadmill, because I cannot carry a heavy oxygen tank with me on the street for 10K steps which takes me 137 minutes with the speed at 2.3 on the treadmill. I'm very proud of my DRs who have taken me from a body  that was just jello, couldnt move anything on my body but turning my head back and forth. I'm still working on walking, next I'm reading on the movements of yoga. Its been over a year I've watched videos and read and watched the poses but I'm so intimidated to try even one session.

MD explained it is the best rx for his symptoms, others ( a nurse we know personally ) have also praised Metoprolol Tartrate because it does work.

Drowsiness, dizziness, lethargy - almost ""zombie"" like, itchy skin, issues going to the bathroom, ( may not feel like it due to the lethargic condition he experiences or have accidents ). Bulging eyes. This really concerned me. And to top it all off, he woke up screaming and shaking one night to the point of becoming pale - which he NEVER does. He is a very calm person. It was a nightmare. Another lovely benefit from this medication :(  Have slowly tapered down from 50 mg. per day to 25 mg. per day.

Metoprolol Tetrate,"I was put on metoprolol (25mg twice a day) for my hyperthyroid symptoms (mostly PVCs and occasional tachycardia).  It helped, but not totally - I would still have 2-3 palpitations per day.  Initially, I was thrilled, because it kicks in for me in about 15-20 minutes.  However, over the few months that I took it, I noticed how lethargic it made me.  I was an absolute slug, which was especially strange given the huge amounts of energy pulsing through me from my out of whack thyroid.  Additionally, it contributed to my brain fog and caused a ringing in my ears.  As beta blockers tend to do, it lowered my blood pressure (which is probably not a problem for a lot of people, but is for me, and a fair number of other hyperthyroid sufferers, from what I hear), causing me to feel very faint/lightheaded, especially when standing or going up a flight of stairs.  Other cons: possible interactions with a lot of meds; I stopped taking oral contraceptives because of the possible effects of mixing the two.  On the other hand, it gave me quick relief when I needed it, and worked well enough to get me through until I could get my health a little more sorted out and switch to a different beta blocker (which, so far, has fewer side effects and less of an impact on my BP).  It's also cheap and easy to take.Read More Read Less",3.3,Overactive Thyroid causing Life-Threatening Symptoms,2012

Metoprolol Tetrate,"I take 25mg 2x day (breakfast and dinner). Instructions say don't take with alcohol.  In my case they mean it.

However if I stay away from alcohol, don't drink more than 1/3 to 1/2 cup of coffee per day, take 45-minute power walks 4 to 5 times per week I feel good. I noticed some weight gain when I first started taking it but got that under control with a modest change in diet and exercise (I'm 6'1"" and 170 lbs.).  It slows my heart rate down so very important to push when I exercise to try and keep the heart rate up enough to exercise the heart muscle.  Other side effects that cause me to rate satisfaction as ""somewhat"" as opposed to ""very"":  ability to concentrate seems to be less and I miss having wine with meals.  As far as controlling heart rythm, it works fine.

Numerous tests proved negative for any disease. After getting off pink pill made by Teva and numerous injections of steroids it took 6 months for me to start feeling better.

Metoprolol Tetrate,"I am a 26 year old mom and I have to say that I am a big stress soaker. I can easily get stressed out about finances but NEVER depressed. Not until I started taking this medicine that is. I started taking it in September for my high blood pressure. When my doctor first prescribed it to me back In January I got it filled but I never actually took the pill. Now when I went back In September I wanted to be put on medicine because of the symptons that I was going through. My right arm will get nubb from time to time and it was times where my heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest. So, I went in and got the prescription. The first time he gave it to me in Januray I was told to take a pill once a day. Now that I am back on it he has me taking the pill twice a day. When I first started to take it I thought it was making me feel better. I got a refill in October and that's when I really started to notice a different in my mood. I was feeling more sad, lonely, and just confused as to why nothing in my life seems to be going well when nothing in my life was going wrong. I found my self crying almost everyday about a whole bunch of nothing. What made me start to realize that it was serious was the fact that it was interferring with my household. My fiance noticed that I was stressed out more and more and notice that I was crying even more. he would try everything to make me feel better but it seems as though nothing was helping. He stayed on top of me about my stress and always made sure that I took my medicine so that my pressure wouldn't get high. Of course not realizing that the more I took it the more depressed I became. I heard that you cannot just stop so suddenly because it may cause other effects. But, I decided to slow down on it by taking 1 a day then ended up not taking it at all.

(Brought it down from my normal resting heart-rate of 137! - to a normal 90 or so.) But just prior to my double-mastectomy (for breast cancer) in April 2010, my cardiologist upped my dosage to 75 mg. of Metoprolol a day, as my anxiety level was through the roof. Ever since my experience with breast-cancer, I believed some of my new ""side-effects"" were all being caused by the cancer-drugs I'm taking ... but I'm seeing here that various reviewers are also experiencing these same side-effects:  numbness and tingling in hands/fingers, joint pain, insomnia, and weight-gain. I never thought about attributing any of these side-effects to my increased dosage of Metoprolol! And the hand/finger numbness/tingling/joint pain has become unbearable, ever since last Spring ... getting worse every month now. Perhaps it's also an unknown drug interaction? (Metoprolol combined with my cancer-drugs?) Hmmmm ... I think I need to call my cardiologist, and see her again soon.

Metoprolol Tetrate,"I was diagnosed 5 years ago with A fib and put on this drug. It did not control the A fib so Flecainide was added.  Eventually, I had a heart ablation that corrected the A fib but then I developed PAC's & Atrial Tachycardia.  I have been on this drug for 5 years and have gained 70 lbs. I too have experienced extreme fatique, hair loss and depression which I now take Pristique for.  Had my 2nd heart blation in July and just slowly weened myself off the Toporol.  Still taking the Flecainide and going to my doctor today for follow-up.  He will not be happy with me when he hears I stopped the Toporol.  I lost 6.5 lbs the first week off the drug.  I really believe this drug is effective for heart arrythmeas but everyone should seek out all options.  Heart Ablation is a good option but you do have to stay on meds until it works.

So about 5 months ago i started to take this medication on a daily basis.

Metoprolol Tetrate,"My cardiologist put me on Metoprolol Tartrate after my heat attack in February 2009.  After my heart attack I was also diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes.  As I worked to improve my health - stopped smoking, low fat, low carb, low sugar, and low sodium diet - and exercised every day I was continuing to gain weight (20 pounds in 5 months).  Because I was a diabetic my primary care physician was continually telling me that I needed to loose weight to improve my health.  I explained to her my lifestyle changes and asked if the Metoprolol Tartrate or insulin could be causing my weight gain.  She said that she didn't think so, but was not entirely sure and even suggested that it was due to poor Diabetes management (my A1C levels went from 11.5 in February to 6.9 in July)!!    After doing alot of research and talking to countless Doctors and Pharmacists I discovered that yes one of the side affects of this drug is excessive unexplained weight gain.    I discussed this with my Cardiologist and he decided to take me off of the Metoprolo Tartrate.  Guess what, I have now lost 8 pounds within the last two weeks following my same diet change and excerise regimen!  I have also been able to  more effectively control my blood sugar and reduce my insulin intake.

Warfarin,"I developed DVT after I went to the hospital suffering from COPD. DVT was the consequence of i.v. placed in my thigh. Three days later, I was discharged from intensive care dispite my complaints about excruciating pain. I went back to the hospital two hours later suffering from an irregular heart beat and internal bleeding. The discoloration and knot as large as a small grapefruit was noticed and ignored. Three days after a blood transfusion I was sent to a rehab center where an ultra sound revealed DVT.  I was sent to different hospital where a filter was surgically placed in my body and I began a series of blood thinner injections. After one week in that hospital and three additional weeks in rehab I went home with instructions to take Warfarin; there were continuous adjustments to the medication. I did not consider the monitoring or the adjustments of the medication problematic after all I had endured; however, I was horrified by my hair loss. My hair looks as though I am receiving radiation therapy. I have seen absolutely no mention of hair loss as a side effect.

Warfarin,"I have been on warfarin since I was 17. I am now 28. I have a rare hyper-coagulating blood disorder and if my blood is not therapeutic I clot right away. This drug has kept me alive. The ability for it to stay in my system keeps it more manageable. Yes I do have blood draws every month to make sure I'm at the right level but it's a small price to pay. The only side effects I have had is when levels were too high and they included bruising, fever, fatigue, muscle pain, and abnormal bowel habits. But as long as I'm at the right level, which is 95% of the time, all is well. I recommend contacting your doctor if you get ill, have an infection or get pregnant. The only qualms I have is that not many medications can be taken with warfarin. This pill sure beats having to take any other anti-coagulant which can only be taken by injection or I.V. All in all, I'm extremely happy with my outcome.Read More Read Less",4.3,Abnormal Increase in Ability of Blood to Clot,2011

My doctor asks, are you taking your dose? Of course I am, I say. So now I have to go and get my blood tested weekly. I think perhaps I need to go back to coumadin, the real stuff.

But every other health care professional let me know the dose they kept putting me on & increasing it was TOO high.  My diet stayed strictly consistent, yet the Warafin clinic didn't believe in anyone being Warfarin resistant.  As the dosage continued to increase, up to 20 mg a day I started noticing side effects new to me.

Warfarin can't cause Tinnitus.  I also have developed a 8o% increase in eye floaters.  The small amount I was having was already diagnosed and was considered normal for me.  The sight  impairment now causes sever restrictions with my ADLs.  I have been sent to a second appointment with an eye specialist for possible treatment.  I was lucky to be put in touch with a wonderful Hematologist Dr. J. Friedman fro University Hospitals Cleveland.

Warfarin,"Diagnosed with DVT in one calf while hospitalized, I was put on heprin, and warfarin while other CT scan results were pending.   They called it a minor clot, and took me off all blood thinners when I left the hospital. The follow up Doppler scan showed another clot in the other calf, I was put on Lovonox immediately, and 10mg of warfarin.  My INR was over 5 after 10 days, so I stopped for 3 days, started again on 7.5, and the INR was 4.7 after another 10 days.  I stopped for another 3 days, then restarted at 7.5mg again as per the Dr.  Sounds a little crazy to me, why not 5mg?  But I'm not the Dr. so I do as I'm told for now.

Warfarin,"This medication is effective and did solve the issue of having ""thick blood"". What upsets me is all the doctors I have talked to never really want to go into deeper discussions as to how to better control the constant blood testing and adjustment of the med along with dietary changes or lifestyle changes to better able control the overall ""harrasment"" in your life having to take this med. Why, I ask has this not been researched further like diabetes has. It seems to me it's like BP meds the longer your on them the more your body is accustomed to them and as time goes on the more dangerous to get off them. I despise having to take this med.   It is effective.  It's easy to use, swallowing a pill put a pain to constantly monitor. How about a home based kit. Prick your finger like DB do?  Satisfaction???

Warfarin,"I've been on coumadin for about 16 years now due to anti phospholipid antibody syndrome and lupus 'features' resulting in 9 TIA's. I'm currently 52 years old so started very young. My INR has always been all over the map and I can't tell you how thrilled I am with my at home testing machine.  It is a life saver for sure.  It's called 'coaguchek XS' and is about the size of a diabetic testing machine.  I used to have the older model which I purchased when it first came out 10 years ago, but it was much larger and more complicated to use.  This new one is a piece of cake.  Not cheap though and I couldn't get it covered by insurance.  The company often has promotions - I paid $1000 and the test strips are about $10 each although once you've been trained on the machine there is a company in California that sells the strips for less.  A little time spent online could save you a ton of money, but make sure you get the proper thing. I've been lucky and have had no real side effects in all my years of taking this drug although my INR jumps from 1.1 - 6.2 for no reason.

Warfarin,"I don't know if they are all related to warfarin, or by interaction with the other meds I have to take, but I have had quite a few side effects. The most distressing problem, which seems to be getting worse, is blurry vision. I have to have my eyes checked every 6 months because of a med I have to take for Lupus. This drug does not cause blurriness, it has a different affect on the eye so I'm certain it's not that med. I had my eyes checked 12/07 & got new glasses (which I knew I needed). I had my next 6 month appt very recently & my vision acquity was exactly as it was in December. However, the later in the day, or the more I've used them, the blurrier my closeup world gets. I'm very near-sighted, so for the most part it's easier for me to take my glasses off to read vs. using bifocals. Since this problem started getting much worse, I have to enlarge the characters at most websites by 125-150%. Thank you WebMD for the option of enlarging the characters at your site--it is most appreciated! I wish all sites had that option!  When typing in website addresses, I have to get within a few inches of my monitor in order to read whats been typed or to read any website address.  I'm still trying to research warfarin to see if I can find additional info about this increasingly problematic condition. It's very likely I'm on so many medications that it is attributable to the combination of the warfarin with something else I'm taking--I don't have enough information to rule anything out yet. I just know it started after I started warfarin after pulmonary embolisms hit me the end of Nov. 2007. I was sent home 5 days later having to add warfarin to my medication list.    The list is quite long because I have to take meds for: lupus, fibromyalgia & neuropathies(hard to seperate),mild high blood pressure,antidepressant & tricyclics,supplemental B12 & Vit D, urological meds,asthma,pain meds, & a med to reduce risk of diabetes.

Back to Dr. tomorrow and have been started on Warfarin 5 dosage.  Have felt tired and a bit week.    Fantastic physical shape from treadmill.  Today was first day back on treadmill.  Within 5 minutes my legs were itching like crazy all over thigh areas front and back.  Didn't go away so I stopped and rode the stationary bike.  Itching went away but felt exhausted after 15 minutes on bike at a 3 an 4 level.      I can do a treadmill for 2 hours with an incline between 10 and 15.  Not being able to work out today after just walking was irritating to say the least and then the itching.

I have also quit drinking alcohol and really cut back on my caffeine. Read More Read Less",5.0,Ventricular Rate Control in Atrial Fibrillation,2023
Metoprolol Tartrate,"According to my Cardiologist, this does not cure afib  and other related arrhythmias, but calms the heart to reduce numbers of attacks and make you more comfortable during attacks.  For me it has done the job so far.  My afib is the kind  that stops you in your tracks and can last 6 to 12 hours or more.  This has been reduced to once every couple of months with metropolol..  Dosage is 25mg split between morning and evening.  It has also reduced my borderline high blood pressure down.  The lower blood pressure can sometimes make you feel a little fatigued, but it is not that noticeable.  You should also quit or cut down on alcohol if you are on this drug or have afib.  Near beer is now the standard, with only a real beer every once and a while. Read More Read Less",4.7,Ventricular Rate Control in Atrial Fibrillation,2023

Metoprolol Tartrate,"I have been taking metroprolol for 12 years. My health has declined since then. I was put in the emergency room for a rapid heartbeat after a bad reaction to some cough medicine. I was in the hospital for 4 days and they prescribed  25 mg twice A-day.  The most noticeable side effect for me was crushing fatigue and just feeling like a zombie. I have very significant brain fog and I just don't feel like I think clearly. I have developed very bad IBS, a chronic  long term pain in my stomach and upper back, Horrible acidic diarrhea Sometimes as much as 20 times A-day. Eventually this led to having my gallbladder removed.  The symptoms have improved but every time I take the medicine within an hour I am in the bathroom. I have also experienced a large amount of hair loss, and a significant loss of sexual desire.  I have become gluten intolerant, dairy intolerant and beef intolerant.  I have terrible acid reflux And I have no tolerance for heat. I feel like my legs and arms are weak. I am glad I found this page because it makes me really question The safety of this medicine for me. It does control my heart rate but it drops to levels that I am really uncomfortable with. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and my heart rate is 58.So yesterday I cut my medicine down to 12 and a 1/2 in the morning and 12 and a 1/2 at night. I'm going to see if this doesn't doesn't drop  my heart rate so low. I know everyone's body chemistry is different and we all react differently but for some people the side effects are very harsh. I have decided I'm going to talk to my cardiologist about the ablation procedure. I have made some pretty significant changes since I 1st was diagnosed doing this VT. I have lost 40 pounds, I have left my high stress job as an over the road trucker, I have learned to say no to other people and do what is best for me and I  Have made other dietary changes.. I allow myself to have one cup of coffee in the morning and no other caffeine. I have also released my sugar consumption and gone gluten and dairy free.  I honestly think if I had not quit gluten I would be disabled today. I think the best thing we can all do is find a good doctor who will listen to our concerns and not run us through the mill.  The last time I saw my cardiologist he was literally in the room with me for 3 minutes.

Metoprolol Tartrate,"After reading the most helpful rated experiences people reported and how other people approved those reviews/experiences there are 2 common themes. Depression and Doctors who won't listen. I'm on 200mg a day and have been for over 9 years. One doctor told me flat out, ""your alternative is death"". In regards to stopping. ""Disease"" puts us in these positions,  not the meds and if you are like me or close then you have more meds than just this? But ""Death"" is my alternative as my Doc said, so perspective gives me a different outlook when put that way?   I just completed a 2 mile hike over very rugged turf, Pickle Springs Conservation Area in Missouri. I carried a camera and lens, water the whole way. I have survived 10 heart attacks, mini-strokes, a cabbage the Docs call them, since 2005 and had over 11 stents placed. I got better...lot's of verticals to climb btw..  This is important to know. I can do things at 65+ I couldn't do 5 years ago or even 15 years ago without experiencing serious repercussions. Today I can pace myself, I have better stamina and endurance and I don't work out at all, just walk when I can. There's no way anyone can convince me that it hasn't provided me a better quality of life - I am living proof.

Metoprolol Tartrate,"All my life my heart has been beating very quickly, like I'd been lightly jogging. It was something I just kept to myself & thought it was normal. 01/19/13 I got the H1N1 Influenza Virus which rendered me completely helpless. I was incubated in the ER, about 3 days later my throat was sliced for a tracheotomy. For 4 Months I was on a ventilator. The DRs would temporarily take me out of my medical induced coma for a time, I would attempt to talk to my Niece, garbled noised to her, clear messages to me. I'd hear her respond she couldnt Understand me. I'd cry when she left in the daytime to sleep because she would stay by my side all night. After 6 weeks I was flown to a specialty facility which specialized in patients with lung problems. Because my heartrate would skyrocket when I was moved when my bedding was changed I was put on Metoprolol. I was a comfortable 180 pounds, I knew I needed to release at least 50 lbs before the virus, but between May 5, 2013 when I was released to June 2016 I gained exactly 100 lbs. I knew I had to do something. I talked to my DR about being serious about losing the weight. So a dietician got involved with my weightloss. So far since October 2016 to today I have released 69 lbs. I'm down to 211lbs despite still taking metoprolol. I plan on keeping going with the 10,000K steps a day walking on my treadmill, because I cannot carry a heavy oxygen tank with me on the street for 10K steps which takes me 137 minutes with the speed at 2.3 on the treadmill.

MD explained it is the best rx for his symptoms, others ( a nurse we know personally ) have also praised Metoprolol Tartrate because it does work.   However; my son has Cerebral Palsy so we have to be careful with any medicine he takes. After reading patient reviews on this drug, I have to agree. Drowsiness, dizziness, lethargy - almost ""zombie"" like, itchy skin, issues going to the bathroom, ( may not feel like it due to the lethargic condition he experiences or have accidents ). Bulging eyes. This really concerned me. And to top it all off, he woke up screaming and shaking one night to the point of becoming pale - which he NEVER does. He is a very calm person. It was a nightmare. Another lovely benefit from this medication :(  Have slowly tapered down from 50 mg. per day to 25 mg. per day.

Dr. states that after a month or so, side effects will no longer be a problem as the body needs time to adjust to the meds. We shall see.

Metoprolol Tartrate,"I was put on metoprolol (25mg twice a day) for my hyperthyroid symptoms (mostly PVCs and occasional tachycardia).  It helped, but not totally - I would still have 2-3 palpitations per day.  Initially, I was thrilled, because it kicks in for me in about 15-20 minutes.  However, over the few months that I took it, I noticed how lethargic it made me.  I was an absolute slug, which was especially strange given the huge amounts of energy pulsing through me from my out of whack thyroid.  Additionally, it contributed to my brain fog and caused a ringing in my ears.  As beta blockers tend to do, it lowered my blood pressure (which is probably not a problem for a lot of people, but is for me, and a fair number of other hyperthyroid sufferers, from what I hear), causing me to feel very faint/lightheaded, especially when standing or going up a flight of stairs.  Other cons: possible interactions with a lot of meds; I stopped taking oral contraceptives because of the possible effects of mixing the two.  On the other hand, it gave me quick relief when I needed it, and worked well enough to get me through until I could get my health a little more sorted out and switch to a different beta blocker (which, so far, has fewer side effects and less of an impact on my BP).  It's also cheap and easy to take.Read More Read Less",3.3,Overactive Thyroid causing Life-Threatening Symptoms,2012

I noticed some weight gain when I first started taking it but got that under control with a modest change in diet and exercise (I'm 6'1"" and 170 lbs.).  It slows my heart rate down so very important to push when I exercise to try and keep the heart rate up enough to exercise the heart muscle.  Other side effects that cause me to rate satisfaction as ""somewhat"" as opposed to ""very"":  ability to concentrate seems to be less and I miss having wine with meals.

But just prior to my double-mastectomy (for breast cancer) in April 2010, my cardiologist upped my dosage to 75 mg. of Metoprolol a day, as my anxiety level was through the roof. Ever since my experience with breast-cancer, I believed some of my new ""side-effects"" were all being caused by the cancer-drugs I'm taking ... but I'm seeing here that various reviewers are also experiencing these same side-effects:  numbness and tingling in hands/fingers, joint pain, insomnia, and weight-gain. I never thought about attributing any of these side-effects to my increased dosage of Metoprolol! And the hand/finger numbness/tingling/joint pain has become unbearable, ever since last Spring ... getting worse every month now. Perhaps it's also an unknown drug interaction? (Metoprolol combined with my cancer-drugs?) Hmmmm ... I think I need to call my cardiologist, and see her again soon. After all these years, I may have to try something else that does NOT have these side-effects. I'm a fine artist and cannot live without FUNCTIONING hands!Read More Read Less",3.3,Other,2011
Metoprolol Tartrate,"I had double bypass nearly 4 years ago. Since then I take 150mg twice a day and 5mg lisinopril. My bp and heart rate stay low IF I watch sodium intake which is important. I have tiredness and get anxious but I keep busy, dont dwell on it and keep my mind active. I work out twice a week at fitness center which helps greatly. I do the cardio water aerobics and recumbant bike.  Working out helps keep bp down and people should not think that medicine alone is enough.  Excercise and proper diet is a hugh contibuting factor.

Metoprolol Tartrate,"My cardiologist put me on Metoprolol Tartrate after my heat attack in February 2009.  After my heart attack I was also diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes.  As I worked to improve my health - stopped smoking, low fat, low carb, low sugar, and low sodium diet - and exercised every day I was continuing to gain weight (20 pounds in 5 months).  Because I was a diabetic my primary care physician was continually telling me that I needed to loose weight to improve my health.  I explained to her my lifestyle changes and asked if the Metoprolol Tartrate or insulin could be causing my weight gain.  She said that she didn't think so, but was not entirely sure and even suggested that it was due to poor Diabetes management (my A1C levels went from 11.5 in February to 6.9 in July)!!    After doing alot of research and talking to countless Doctors and Pharmacists I discovered that yes one of the side affects of this drug is excessive unexplained weight gain.    I discussed this with my Cardiologist and he decided to take me off of the Metoprolo Tartrate.  Guess what, I have now lost 8 pounds within the last two weeks following my same diet change and excerise regimen!  I have also been able to  more effectively control my blood sugar and reduce my insulin intake.

I believe in the quality of life if a medicine makes you feel as bad as what I've been reading about this medicine it's not worth it.

Metoprolol Succinate,"I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in December 2019 at the age of 46 after having approx. 3 years of prior joint pain. After a few months of physical therapy, the pain began to return and was much worse. This is what led to RA testing, upon confirming this diagnosis I was extremely confused why I developed it, RA does not run in my family. My rheumatologist started me on methotrexate and I made appointments with two orthopedic surgeons. I will mention that prior to all of this my hair has been falling out in handfuls for years, leaving me with very thin hair. The pain became too much to bear so I had my left shoulder replaced on 11/23/20. I have had 2 separate hip injections to help relieve pain in the right hip area and I know that joint will have to be replaced at some time. Currently, my right shoulder is giving me more problems with pain and the ability to function because I am right-handed. I have contacted all my doctors, the FDA directly, and my pharmacist; as well as done my own research. Following is the email I sent to my doctors: I received some extremely shocking news from a stranger today and I'm scared and need to know what to do next. Long story short I was small talking with a lady and mentioned I had RA and she got a blank stare on her face and said ""are you on metoprolol?"". I said yes, she said ""get off now"", it causes RA and makes you lose your hair, I removed my cap and told her I bought Rogaine last night because my hair is so thin and getting worse. I notified my pharmacist and my PCP. Both have heard of side effects but had never actually seen someone with it. Well, that may not be accurate anymore. I have already done some research on my own and have found a small study from 1986 and more in-depth research at Taiwan University. WebMd also mentions that this is a very rare occurrence but this RARE event has caused irreparable destruction, disruption, and hardship to my body, my family, and possibly the length of my life.

My mother had no cognitive issues prior to being put on this drug, at the tail end of the first year of being on it, she started displaying signs of forgetfulness.  That's all it ever was and did not disrupt her daily life at all.  A few years ago her doctor increased her dosage from 50mg to 100mg and three months later she had her first hallucination.  Everyone wrote my mother off has having dementia, but it never made any sense until I did the research myself when nobody else gave it a second thought, including ""medical professionals"".  This drug has been linked to triggering psychosis and delirium & has been documented as a drug with potential side effects that mimic dementia.  This drug is also a beta blocker that can have awful side effects in elderly patients, like what was happening to my mom.  If someone you love is taking this drug, and they start showing dementia like symptoms after being put on it, look at this drug as being the potential culprit.

My doctor switched me to Amlodipine and Celexa, stopping the Metoprolol cold turkey (although I questioned it and was told it would be fine). Big mistake. Huge. Got to work and thought I was having a heart attack. Ended up in urgent care and then the ER. Now tapering off like I should have in the first place and it hasn't been pleasant. I can't wait until this poison is out of my system. I'm already noticing my hair isn't falling out like it was. I don't know if this works for other people but I will never go near it again.

Metoprolol Succinate,"4 months ago, I had transcather aortic valve replacement.  6 wks.ago started on Metoprolol  25mg. 1X day, seemed to manage Palpitations well, lower BP. No change in frequent skipped beats.  2 weeks ago MD Increased to 2X day because BP still too high, within 7 days have I had severe leg and foot cramps, numbness and pain in legs, feet and hands, also in thighs. Have reduced to 1X day, and will start half tab, then stop.  I had been doing 2 1/2 mile walk daily, and had to completely stop due to foot pain. Will see Cardiologist in 1 wk.  I blame symptoms on addition of metoprolol. Also 3 years have been on Arimidex and  2 weeks Xarelto , which can cause similar side effects.  But change in dose of metoprolol seems a significent reason for symptoms. Certainly agreed to by so many comments on Webmd. Read More Read Less",2.3,Prevention of Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation,2018

I asked my neurologist to change me to atenolol which does not cross the brain and all of the above symptoms have gone but it took a year to get it out of my system and I began to feel normal again. I am doing fine on the atenolol but it is not slow release. I am taking the drug because I was diagnosed in my 30's with premature ventricular contractions. I took no meds for it until I was 65 and the symptoms became more pronounced, 18,000 dropped heartbeats within 24 hours. My sister has been diagnosed with the same thing so I think it was inherited.

Metoprolol Succinate,"Just wanted to share my experience getting OFF metoprolol ER 25 mg, and switching to Diltiazem ER, 120 mg. After a pulmonary embolism (no symptoms except PVCs), I suffered PVC w/anxiety and panic attacks, even while treating blood clots with Coumadin. I was put on 25 mg metoprolol ER to help the anxiety and PVCs- it helped immediately. I stayed on several years. I continued the dosage, and tried to stay/get in shape. I steadily gained weight, assumed it was age. Exercising felt impossible. After a year or so, I was also having afternoon hypotension upon standing quickly. I developed symptoms of asthma, wheezing and chest tightness   severe fatigue. Reported my symptoms finally, and I was switched to Diltiazem. After 8 days of body adjustment (w/small amount of Ativan a few nights to control anxiety), I again felt human. Exercise is now more efficient. In my case, It was a direct switch from one med to the other. Yes, I think I had some adjustment coming off metroprolol- headache, chills, uneasiness, muscle cramps, a little heart pounding, slightly higher pulse rate (no pvcs however), and bp went up about 10 points (not a big issue for me). All the symptoms of having too much adrenalin. I took it easy that first week- low exertion, low stress (well, that is debatable- election week), .25 to .5 mg Ativan at night the first 4 nights or so. By 1st day, better breathing. By 8 days, I felt much better overall. 120 mg Diltiazem ER has not produced any noticeable adverse effects for me, at least, at this point. I'm 41, a divorced mom of 4, I usually walk now about 10,000 steps every day, and I'm about 40 lbs overweight (so happy to be able to work on this now :) Good luck! Hang in there.

Could not sleep at night, had violent dreams, woke up feeling distressed.  Switched to Brand name Toprol XL, after 5 days symptoms were worse. Legs had reduced in size about 1/4. Muscle pain getting worse. Went back to doctor, he took me off by halving the tablet for several days, then started back on Cardura.  I have researched the fillers used in drugs that I have had problems with, and am convinced that the fillers are the main problems for me.  Once I get this out of my system, I might try the Brand Toprol XL again.  For right now, I'm trying to get back on my feet and be able to drive and start walking again.  Still have a lot of pain. I've been told that there is no difference in generic and Brand by doctors, nurses, pharmacists.  All one needs to do is get the ingredients in generics and Brand, and compare the two.

Metoprolol Succinate,"Hi,   I am a 26 year old female that was diagnosed with severe heart palpitations, high blood pressure and tachachardia all at the same time...it was nothing for my heart rate to get up to 140 b/p/m SITTING STILL! Any physical activity at all and i felt like i was going to pass out! My heart was also palpitating just every few minutes. I was SO SCARED i was gonna have a heart attack or worse. I am also an insulin dependant diabetic since I was 8. The drs put me through EVERY test in the book, holter monitors, lab work, ekg, echocardagrams, stress test and even a heart catherization in July of this year. They could not find ANYTHING wrong with my heart! My cardioligist said I had the heart of a 16 year old! I changed from a very active person to a couch potato because i was so scared something was going to happen to me! I developed severe panic attacks and depression and was afraid to be alone even for short periods of time. My blood pressure was also running high like 140 or 150 / 90's to 100's. They started me out on Diltiazem which did me absolutely NO good and caused me to feel very tired and sleepy all the time! Then they tried me on bystolic which i had an allergic reaction to and thought my throat was going to completely close up! Then they put me on Metaprolol 50mg tablets once in the morning. I have been on this pill since October. So far the ONLY side effect that I have is that my ankes are swelling pretty bad. It has dropped my blood pressure to like 117/60 or 70 and has dropped my pulse rate to like 70-80. It has also made my heart palpitations very few and far in between! I have NOTHING bad to say about this drug except that is has made my feet swell but I can deal with that verses living every day being petrified that something is gonna happen to me! I am supposed to go to my family dr. to probably get put on a low dose water pill for the swelling! This drug has REALLY helped me! Read More Read Less",4.7,High Blood Pressure,2009

After take the Ethex pill for 3 nights, I woke up in the middle of the 3rd night to go the bathroom, walked a few steps, got very dizzy and fainted.  I lost consciousness for maybe 2 seconds.

I went back to sleep & when I woke up in the morning, my blood pressure was 90 over 60, very low.  I then called CVS & asked them about the Ethex pill.  He said it differers from the ones made by Par 'cause it has fillers.  I spoke to my pharmacist on Long Island where I had moved from & he said that sometimes the fillers that are in some pills make the pills a bit more potent, & if that's the case, I was taking more than 25 mgs. of the medicine.  CVS doesn't carry Par so now I had to go to another drug store & since Par was on back order, I had to order the non-generic Torprol XL 25 & pay a lot more.

I did research on line & there are many Ethex drugs that are being pulled from shelves not by the FDA but by patients that have complained about them.

My pharmacist said she has recently seen patients having problems with their BP increasing and had to go back to Toprol XL.  I am convinced that is my problem also.  This change occured over many months.  The pharmacist said the difference is in the ""binder"" they use for this drug. I will see my Doctor first thing Monday, to get me off this, and back on Toprol XL. It will take a letter/call from him to convince insurance the drug is failing me.Read More Read Less",1.7,High Blood Pressure,2008

Metoprolol Succinate,I started the generic form 2-3 mo. after mitral valve repair surgery. During cardiac rehab my resting heart rate was in the low 100's. I have been taking 1/2 of 25 mg. for 1yr. hoping my heart rate would slow down as my heart healed. I have tried several times to not take it and noticed an uncomfortably high heart rate at rest. No problems with it except that I have not been able to lose 15 lbs. that I put on after surgery even though I have been watching my caloric intake and excercising with a personal trainer 3 times a week for 8 mo. I also hoped my energy level would have been a bit better by now. I am 48 and in perfect health otherwise. I will call my cardiologist and try hard to get off of it.I hope that does the trick because summer is coming.Read More Read Less,4.7,Other,2008

I was on it last summer and my doctor's did not tell me to decrease it slowly and in the heat of summer I had the potential of fainting. Well, that happened. When the bottle was empty, I did not know it was to be filled, my doctor was not monitoring me well enough, even though my BP's were through the roof. It caused me to go into severe tachycardia and arryrhytmia's. So BEWARE, be your own advocate. Talk to your pharmacisit, or look things up on Web MD.

I cannot thank these reviews enough for making me aware of the side-effects of this drug. None of this was mentioned at the pharmacy when I picked this medication up and/or is it mentioned in the paperwork which accompanies this medication from the pharmacy.  My husband is also on kidney dialysis, is a severe diabetic and is a post 6 by-pass heart surgery patient. I'm sure this all attributed to his side-effects, but no mention of any of these reactions was noted by the pharmacy. The only side-effect mentioned on the paperwork were ""may cause diarrhea, headache, dizziness or drowsiness.""Read More Read Less",1.0,Feel Like Throwing Up,2009

Metoclopramide,"I was feeling sick every morning that I was waking up due to a previous bad drug that was prescribed to me...(that other drug gave me an ulcer).  I went to a specialist and put a scope down to my stomach and they found that my food wasn't digesting properly.  Metoclopramide has helped me greatly.  I only take it twice a day but it has eliminated my upset stomach and feeling of vomiting.  I didn't take it for a day and my upset stomach came back.  The only bad experience I had with this drug is one night I had about 3-4 alcoholic drinks and then I got tunnel vision, light headed, and I passed out (fell to the floor) for a few seconds.  That was my fault though because I was advised not to drink.  Read More Read Less",4.7,Feel Like Throwing Up,2009
