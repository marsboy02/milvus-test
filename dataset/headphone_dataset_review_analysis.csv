Ramdika,Really Exceed my expectation.,Black,30-May-21,"Okay.. I was skeptical at first to buy this as i was tight at my budget , but to be honest this little product really exceed my expectation. If you are really tight on budget just go for this one.Ps for Redmi phone user , go to setting sound effect and user equilizer and play around with sound enhancer to get the best sound result.",5
Sachin AK,Great for a change from inear buds,Black,01-Jun-21,The earphone is worth what you pay for. The design of the earbud may cause pain after prolonged usage. In that case basshead 103 is good.In terms of sound this is way more advanced than basshead 103. Bass is also increased.Quality wise i would preferred the nylone wrapping of even the two small cable would have been better. Since most of the time those cable gets damaged.,5
Manikandan Raj,For people with sensitive ears,Black,05-Sep-21,"Particularly for people with sensitive ears, who gets ear pain when wearing those in ear buds kind of headsets, this one is a great choice. It doesn't block air flow into ear, so it is good for ear drum as well.",4
Reviewguy,I tested it for a week and here's a detailed review,Iguana,11-Sep-21,"Built Quality 6.5 10The lower wire is a durable nylon that is as you know, tough but the middle part where the mic and the single button itself lies feels cheap, including the earpiece, the plastic used don't feel or look that good but the wire length is good though. Probably 1.2 1.3m.Comfort 7 10Feels decently good for people who don't like rubber tipped earphones, the fit is good and is comfortable in your ears, nothing much to talk about hereSound Quality 7 10The max volume is quite loud pretty loud, that's a plus point. The treble is crisp and the bass is decently strong, works well in Xiaomi Redmi phones which have options for earphones selection for different sound quality preferenceMic 6 10The mic is not the best, it just gets the job done. It picks up noise when you are speaking to someone on the phone while using this and walking at the same time doing some physical activity. While playing games like BGMI Call of Duty, the mic worked good with no issues but on calls, it wasn't just as good.Price to performance ratio 6.5 10This product is for people who wants a decent in Ear Wired Headset Without rubber tips and not for people who are into the rubber tipped ones. If you use rubber tipped earphones and wanna get a good one under 500 rupees, get either of these two 1.BoAt Bassheads 100 Cheaper but great for the price 2. Realme Buds 2 Good sound and built quality an additional rubber band for easy storage",4
Sridhar Sarkar,Not a good headphone,Iguana,26-Jun-21,"Don't go with the over all 4 start rating. This boat brand endorse lot of money through marketing and you can see on the front pack of the headphones it must be Karthik aryaan Neha Kakkar hardik or Kl Rahul and you might think oh wow what a great product. And eventually you will also buy. But you know what, this product is not good at all. Don't go this over all rating.Voice is so suppressing that you won't be able to enjoy the music properly. Though, it looks very classy and pretty. Tangled free wire which is plus point. It does not have good bass at all. Rs. 150 oppo Vivo headphones are also better than this. Note This product is non returnable.",2
gurvinder singh,Faulty earphones. Volume drop issue,Spirit Lime,05-Sep-21,"Please believe me, Volume of my phone automatically gets down when earphones are plugged in. Youtube play pause, next previous video buttons wont go away when earphones are plugged in. This is very annoying. I cant even watch a 5 mins video peacefully. I have to raise volume again and again. Mic quality is very normal. Boat is lying about the crystal clear sound. You can get the same voice quality in 100 150rs local earphones. My 450rs got totally wasted. I bought boat for the first time. Never buying boat again. They are just overated and make faulty products.",1
Sumit Chaurasiya,More than expected,Black,29-Jun-21,"I am not very keen of music listening, so can't comment how good music it produce. My purpose of using this is fully focused on call. It is doing a great work, more than expected. People on other side able to here me correctly. Sound produce by it is loud enough to here correctly. There is no noise cauae by this headphone. Previously I used jbl and phillips, they are not only castly than this but their durability is also questionable. This one is fully justifying its price.This one did not came with tagle free, but wire is textured which make it easier to untangle.",4
blessy,Will damage your ears,White,28-Sep-21,"This product has caused me so much of damage that I had to write a review. Here is the thing. It is cheap and it works well with calls. I also wanted an alternative to in ear buds that are available in the market. Hence, I bought it. Honestly, it has been a month and the earphone is working fine. However, I don't know what kind of a design boat is bragging of. First of all using this earphone just for a few days has made my ears a little swollen. Also, it doesn't fit well. It will either fall off or it will hurt. If you lie down and use this expect it to fall off. If you sit down and use this expect it to give you some minor cuts. Why even buy this if you cannot use it properly Volume buttons are not there. I thought I could do without it but the truth was later on I needed it. My suggestion is that if you want to buy a cheap product try out other brands in the same price range, buy the 50 rupee or 100 rupee one from small retailers or simply shell more money and get a better deal. Finally, thank you boat for this terrible experience . I will never buy another product of yours unless I have no choice and will never compromise on quality over money.",1
Amazon Customer,"Don't buy, Not good",Iguana,27-Jul-21,"One side stopped working within 20 days of buying, now they are asking to go to service center for replacement which is 30 km away from my house, so ultimately I need to spend more amount as taxi fare then the product cost to get it replaced.No response so far even after sending the mail 10 days ago.I trusted the brand but they are also following the same path now where they don't care about selling the product.",1
Hameed bin abbas,BOAT IS ALWAYS BEST,Black,15-Jun-21,"Best headset ever I used in my life, genuin product, good condition, reasonable price, value for money. And thanks to Amazon for a perfect delivery feature.",5
Ak,Grab the Greenish Grey Color. Its awesome.,Iguana,31-Aug-21,it is made of premium quality plastic and has good finishing. I use it for hours and don't feel anything troubling my ears. Well crafted and ergonomic design made to go with the flow. The wire stem is thick and the branches are rubberised but are of good quality. If you make sure that it does not get struck by your arms while using then it can surely last about 4 years.Good for calling. No mic issues faced. Music is fine no complaints. Grab this product and save your ears.The in ear headphones do a vacuum suction to the ears and can lead to severe problems if used for long hours.,5
Shankar.B,Good choice for regular usage and meetings,Black,25-Jun-21,"Boat is known brand, definitely everyone expects premium sound quality. This model almost meets the expectations.Pros 1. Premium looks, quality and design2. Comfortable3. Good sound and Bass4. Attractive Red colour Play pause button5. Mic is clearly noticableCons 1. Netted cable is given between jack to mic, which is less durable2. No volume controller, previous, next buttons3. Treble is not good4. Not noticed any noise cancellation5. Over priced",4
Aryan kohli,Not for listening to music,Iguana,07-Nov-21,"If you are the type of person who does not like to fumble around with Bluetooth on windows laptops and already have a good pair of headphones and earphones and need these for taking online classes or meetings or just watching youtube, they are totally alright for that purpose.The build quality is very nice. Will survive some abuse. Have braided cable. The plastic quality is also excellent no sharp edges.I have compared these to apple's earpods. earpods still sound better than these. Don't buy these for music purposes because you'll be heavily disappointed. They sound garbage, but for anything speech related, these are fine. As I said, if you want to take a quick meeting or just for an online class or watch youtube.",3
Vickey,"Disappointed Looks pretty, sound's bad",Blue,15-Jun-21,Audio quality is pathetic. Vocals are suppressed too much. Beats and Bass are too high. Not enjoyable.,2
Murali K.,Extremely poor sound output,White,07-Oct-21,"I tried comparing the output of these earphones with that of apple original earphones this boat earphones cannot stand anyway near apple earphones, i agree you get what you pay for but in this case it feels more like cheated zero value for the money spent, the earphones are not worth even 100 rupees",1
swapnil tayade,Underrated headphones,Blue,09-Jul-21,"It has 13.5 mm driver at this price makes it superb. Sound quality is actually very good as compared to other mi, realme etc wired headphones at this price. Also people's who don't like ear buds they can find it as good option. It seems underrated headphones but actually it's sound is very nice if you can compare with others.I like chilly combination in blue and orange combo with untangled write.",5
Dennis Bob Philip,Value for money,Black,06-Dec-21,"Very light, surprisingly loud for the tiny size. Very light, cable build quality braided cloth feel outstanding. The plastic earpiece is very light, chunky heavy duty single button. Fits just right, could hurt if you went to sleep wearing them and turned your head to the side as it's plastic. Boat quality for a very competitive price. Old school basic design from the first mobile phone days.",4
Subhendu Santra,Sound quality can be much better,Black,28-May-21,The media could not be loaded. Sound is good but the bass is quite low,4
Vishal TK,Value for money,White,03-Jun-22,"I bought it for attending meetings. The earphone with soft tip turned out to uncomfortable during prolonged use. Then I came across this earphone.1. Value for money2. braided cable3. Clear audio4. Other party can hear me well during meeting5. Balanced bassIf you are bass head and looking for earphone which gives strong bass, then this is not the product for you. Rest of the janta can buy this earphone.",5
Kaiwalya Labade,It's what you pay for,White,03-Nov-21,"My review is still keeping in mind that it is a 299 earphone. Still is too crappy. The bad is too pumped up and the vocals get too much muffled. I bought this because I needed a non silicone earbud replacement for my over the ear headphones, since they get sweaty sometimes. I had to manually lower the bass just to listen to normal yt videos and play game. There are better options but I wanted something in this shape so it's alright.",3
Kalyan goud,OK product for it's price,Blue,18-Jul-21,"The bass is quite good.Well balanced treble.The cable is sturdy and tangle free.Fits right in my ears.Update after 3 months usage Both the sides stopped producing effective sound that they used to produce when i used it for the first time....now they produce lower volume 1year warranty is just a statement nothing works UPDATE of return So i contacted boat support and they agreed for the pick up and after product testing, they approved to replace my product with a new one and now i got new earphones from boat but NOT from amazon....so u can contact boat support if your product isn't working fine within the warranty period...Thank you.",1
Karan Narang,Unexpectedly good,Black,22-Sep-21,"There isn't any noise cancelling, which is totally fine but their sound is RELLY good I've been against using Boat earphones since I haven't had a good experience with 3 models of boat, somehow this was the only option in the budget I was looking for and they are by far great Amazing built quality, great sound, okayish mic but that isn't too much of a problem",5
sushanth reddy,A budget replacement for apple earpods,Black,15-Jun-21,Decent sound quality on music and calls. Bass is elevated just a little bit not too much. Sturdy wires and the wire from jack to mic is braided and has a good texture and feel. The jack is some kid of rubberized plastic so it helps to grip it when pulling the jack from phone or laptop. Satisfield for the value it provides for the price.,4
Amazon Customer,Worth buying,Blue,20-Jun-21,The media could not be loaded. Product look is good. Sound clarity is also good. They could have used magnets like other phones. Product comes with one year warranty.Have to see endurance,4
Amit Gaikwad,Good One,Iguana,24-Oct-21,Nice quality fitted good for me. even it does't have noise cancellation but still sound is quite laud and during call or during listening music its not disturb due to surrounding. just like mi its should be have magnet sticking as its quite useful in many cases. also its mic volume control should be in right side not in middle. right side near mouth position good during noisy surrounding or less network area.,3
amrit raj,"It sucks, waste of money",Black,23-Oct-21,"Delivery was fast no doughts about that but after using 3 days only it started showing problems first microphone stopped working without any reason, then after 2 days the whole device stopped working using it in vivo y51a very bad experience and really disappointing by baot as for the price it is definitely overpriced, 50 rupee street earphone is much better than thisDon't go for it ... Look for something else",1
Mukul Sharma,Good buy in this price,White,13-Jun-21,The earphones looks okay. Basically in this price they solve the purpose. You can take meetings and use them as normal earphone. They fit perfectly. I thing it's the best purchase in this price. Obviously they can't be use to hear music if you are hardcore music listener you won't find that good in this case.,5
Kajari Biswas,Wonderful product,Black,17-Nov-21,It's a wonderful product. Using it for more that 2 3months now. The sound quality is excellent. I was using big sound proof headsets for a long time. Had to choose this one for travel and some special need. Initially i was sceptical that how my sound experience would be after those big headsets. But this is a nice change. Build quality is very good.Amazon delivery is a thumps up...,5
Junead Q.,Good Quality and last long,White,01-Mar-22,"Have bought total of 3 earphones , obviously after using 1 i bought 2 more , Planning to buy some more when price drops 350.Good quality , strenght is awesome.Only draw back is background noise cancellation during call. I was excpecting good noise cancellation but it's not there.overall it's good insted of buying 100rs earphone multiple times this one last long. I am using it more than 6mths and I am a heavy user.",4
sk,Basic did not work morethan day.,Iguana,07-Oct-21,"Basic did not work morethan 1 day.This earphones i have used on my Mobile sound was pure basic. Tried for my office calls over Zoom Skype there is a lot of static. After few calls, the echo static increased more.Tried restarting the laptop still same. Had to go back to my old Samsung's.I dont want a Replacement, please helpe me with Return Redund.",1
Ritwik,"Generic piece , don't expect much .",Black,25-Apr-22,"Won't even last 8 months , these companies are deliberately making this ear phones to wear out in less than year so that they can have a steady demand . Its always the same problem no matter what brand you buy, one ear piece would stop working in less than a year. Its the agreed upon business model by earphone cartel",2
Swagat Sourabh,Nice,Spirit Lime,25-Nov-21,I have oily inner ears. So i alwaysprefer such ear phines. I got it in sale for good price. The quality is really good. But bass and noise cancellation is not the best feature as this is a regular build earphone. But its good for low price and sound quality. Also does not hurt your ear.,5
Mohammad Bilal,Read before you buy,Iguana,19-Jul-21,"Built quality 10 10Sound quality 20 10 yes that goodI knew boats would do a good job in terms of sound clarity and quality but since I only prefer half in ear earphones I didn't expect it to give this good outcome in a half in ear earphone. Super impressed quality, clarity and bass yes bass in a half in ear earphone you read it right. Go for it guys and fall in love with the old school most comfortable earphone style ever.",5
Ivy,Doesn't clog ears. Voice clartiy could have been better.,White,13-Sep-21,"Earphones which came with my Oppo phone got damaged so i bought this one. Compared to that earphones, the Boat earphones have slightly lesser voice clarity, but its wires are thicker so less likely to crack. I like this ear buds design as it doesn't clog ears unlike the buds which tightly snug into ear and block airflow. But it would have been better if Boat instead of paying to celebrities would have spent the resources on improving voice clarity.",5
Arjun C,Value for the price,White,18-Sep-21,"Reviewing after about 1month use. We cannot compare it with premium ones, but quality is worth the price..Pros 1. Good and comfortable design, especially for whom bud type is uncomfortable. 2. Sound quality not that bad.Cons 1. After the button, the matrrial is normal rubber and chances of break is there.",5
Sagar Bhandare,Apple design but poor mic and average sound quality,White,11-Jan-22,"Only look is fantastic same like Apple earphone. But sound quality and mic quality is not so good. It's average. For cheap 399 earphone this is expected. Better go for good quality earphones. Only design is best rest all not useful much.Sound is not clear, it spreads.",4
Amazon Customer,Good value for money,White,06-Sep-21,"Received product is great packing secured packing to know my earphone were original and earphone are very sturdy, durable..I liked them as my usage is very rough and I washed earphone cable as well to clean them...After washing cable, it s still working great.. Update After using for 6 months it has started to malfunction...sometimes mic is not working or sound is not coming...",4
Utkrisht Upadhyay,"It's not a bad piece, but far from the best in its class.",Iguana,21-Nov-21,"I'm a constant user of Boat, buying their earphones every few months because earphone cables can be surprisingly delicate . . , and this was my latest experiment , so as to say. While they aren't necessarily bad earphones, they're fairly lackluster. The volume only goes so high, noise cancellation is nonexistent and the hard plastic hurts your ears when wearing something over it. But hey, it's a personal listening device for 400. I guess there's not much to complain about. Still, in that same 400, you can go for a 102 or 100 instead. They're truly good earphones. This is just an okay one, but it's an okay I won't say no to.",4
SANDIP TIVARI,BoAt .. You are becoming G.O.A.T.,Iguana,06-Jul-21,"I have never seen an Indian market can compare in tech world. But BoAt, you are energetically competing. Product is awesome. wired and color combination for this earphone is quite unique. and the sound quality... Mashallah...Price is in range for audio quality and wired earphone. Thanks for making this product.",5
Manish Sutradhar,Sound Quality is okaish type,Black,22-Dec-21,"bass quality 3 stars treble Quality 3 stars Sound Quality 3.5 starsoverall if you need and earphone just to take some calls and if you are on tight budget then you can go for it because in this price range boat is providing a decent earphone like this.if you can add 200 more , go with boat 255 wired earphone worth Rs499, its worthy and am using it too since past 4 years obviously i changed it like 2 times",4
AC,Like it,Black,24-Dec-21,"Good sound quality. . Only don't like the ear plugs....hard plastic and big....should have soft ear plugs. Wire is covered with some thread material unlike plain plastic....hence more durable, doesn't get tangled nor gets stretched.",3
JANANI S,WIRED EARPHONE ALWAYS BOAT,Black,20-Jan-22,IAmA boAthead always. My old one was lost so got this boat wired. Its more than my expectation. As i always lik plastic ear head than rubber ones this one is so perfect fr the ones like me. Especially the quality of the sound is first class.,5
Gokul Nair,Great half in ear earphones,White,31-Jan-22,I like how it feels while using it. Doesn t cause much trouble like the earphones with silicone buds. Mic sensitivity is as expected. I m using it for work. Looks like a good buy to me. However since its a wired earphone I won t recommend it for workouts. Wireless ones work better when your aim is to move around more rather than sit in front of a laptop or computer,5
Kanakaraj,Good product,White,19-Feb-22,Purchased on December 2021.Fits comfortably in the ear.Tangle free wires are awesome.Good for attending online classes for longer duration with minimal discomfort.Noise cancellation is good.Go for it. Worth the money.,4
Bhavesh,bad sound balance. already replaced times.,Blue,27-Nov-21,Not good for long term use.Bass is ok but not so good.Audio balance on L R was really bad even after getting it replaced 3 times from Boat service centre.Not loud enough.Wire seems good.Not a good fit in ear.Edit. Replacement for the 3rd time. Yet having same issue. Audio balance shifts to left after 2 weeks of use. Not a good model.Please get some other models.,1
Priyanka,My earphones got spoiled within one month.,Spirit Lime,23-Feb-22,"I have purchased 3 earphones of this same variety, different colours in October. Within one month one earphone is not working properly giving a buzzing sound. Another one for spoiled in 2 months. Earphones are good. But lifeline is not something expected from Boat.Also i am extremely careful with my earphones and i don't use them roughly or keep dropping them.It has 6 months warranty. But no details available to claim the warranty. Should i blame Amazon for it",1
Ananya,Overall good choice but no volume control,White,03-Mar-22,"The earphones work quite good. The cord connecting the aux to the mic is fabric wrapped so that saves a lot of hassle regarding fraying and tearing. The sound quality as really well, and at high volumes it does act as noise cancelling although that wouldn t be healthy for the ears . The only big downside for me was the lack of volume control with the mic. I watch my study videos, movies and listen to music quite regularly so the volume control is a big convenience for me. Apart from this point, overall it s a good choice.",4
Rajkumar,NOT AT ALL GOOD A DISASTER,White,23-Mar-22,Bought with expectations as the Punch line is SUPER EXTRAAA BASS but the ground reality is total opposite. It delivers a mono sound only. I really wonder how the maker can brand the Product as Super extraaa bass when there is hardly any. There s no stereo effects too. I have burnt my fingers.,1
Hemant Maurya,"Stereo doesn't work, No bass on this bassheads",Spirit Lime,25-Aug-21,"Stero not working, damn, even a 50 rupees earphone gives that.Absolutely No bass, why the have given name BASSHEADS It doesn't fit in earphone jack on MI Mobiles at least, it comes out in 2 3 minutes...",2
shreeram k.,Muffled Music,Spirit Lime,17-Jul-21,I wasn't expecting this from boAt. People buy earphones for the music experience and this doesn't let you have that experience.The music is muffled and every tone feels so suppressed. I didn't find many alternatives for half in ear design so went for this one. The only good thing is that it has the braided cable.If you don't care about the rubber tip design or half in ear design PLEASE do not buy this one.,3
Vinod,Misleading Product Description Earphones are not fully braided,Black,20-Jan-22,"Tried boAt earphones for the first time, but deeply disappointed felt betrayed. The product description offers that, the ear phones are braided, but not fully. They are braided only below the mic area, where as the most vulnerable ones are left un braided. Unfortunately there is only replacement policy offered by boAt, but no cancellation. Would surely not recommend this product.",1
Simran ,"The length of the wire from where the wire splited, should have been longer",Black,17-Sep-21,"Overall, this earphone is really good. Good quality audio. Good wiring of left and right. And a good range of Hz.Except a little expensive for what it offers.And, the splitter would be really close to my face.",4
Deepak k.,Cheapp product,White,29-Oct-21,"Thought that it would work for at least short span .But this product by boat is just complete waste It lowered the volume on its own and suddenly played high volume music on its own, 3 times Really unexpected this wass",1
Stark,It s worth for the price,Blue,05-Dec-21,It actually looks good and the quality seems great. Since it is an INEAR design I don t think it is comfortable for everyone. Been using for almost 3 months I could tell it is worth the price. The audio quality is great. You could still hear the background noises while listening to music or just increase the volume. Bass might be a bit low still does the job. Great for an Rs 400 worth earphone. I would easily recommend it to anyone for this price.,4
SreeAni,"Not good for calls ,i recommend real me headphone for this price",Spirit Lime,27-Jul-21,"Most of the time it wont get connected to the jack correctly.Voice is having bass so we will have ear pain after phone calls.Real me was 100 better than this.Unofrtunately ,I forgot to return this item.For listening to music ,it is good",2
Sanjana Sahi ,Wouldn't recommend buying it,White,18-Nov-21,"Ears hurt a lot, so can't wear them for a long timeSound quality is quite Mediocre very heavy Wouldn't recommend for people who aren't into heavy BASS music, want to make calls your voice will be heavy",2
Guru,After months,Spirit Lime,07-Sep-21,"It was working good for 2 months, then the right side sound got low and off balance. Never dropped it or unpluggged it from my laptop, still the sound in one side got lower. Worth for the money, but not for longevity.",1
Harshit,Best buds on budget,Iguana,15-Nov-21,See if you are the one who doesn't like those rubber earphones and want something old skool the one's we used to get with our old nokia phones I get the design is apple like but it's good. In you won't regret buying these. And if u want heavy bass ones go for 225 or something like that.,5
Tejas Parit,Not suitable for pixel phones,Spirit Lime,22-Sep-21,I always heard static voice while using it for calls. Replaced 1st item as I thought its faulty product. But same thing happened with replaced product. Plus my volume started to increase to highest automatically during calls. Returned product after that.,1
Subu,Just like the earphone of road side shop,White,01-Feb-22,"Nothing to mention about this. 1.Very low quality. 2.No left or right ear mentioned. This type of item is available within rs 125 instead , boat demanding rs340 rs40 delivery charge. Don't go for it.",2
HARISANKAR A,Best product,Black,01-Jul-21,I was using bassheads 100 when I purchased this. Definitely bass is a lot more and you can feel the depth of sound. Voice and other instruments sounds more clear.120 cm cable length. 3.5 mm Jack. Comes with one year manufacturer warranty,5
Ira M.,Great value of money,White,15-Sep-21,The earphones I first got were not good but I exchanged it and now I really like them. The sound is great and clear and the earphone has a woven thread cover on the wire which reduces tangling and chances of breakage. I recommend these and they are half in ear so they are great for those who don't like rubber in ear earphones,5
Nikhil.S,No adequate bass and sound quality.,Black,23-Oct-21,"I am returning it now as it is not upto my expectations bass ,sound quality eww it's like a 50 rs market earphones just buy a boat sports one which is 399 price tag now my cousin has it .. it has good dept bass and sound quality..so dont even think of getting this ....... my review is done here so its u r wish to buy it or not k ..",3
CHINMAY CHAITANYA,Pathetic build quality,Blue,02-Oct-21,"The sound quality and design was decent considering the price. But the build quality is Pathetic. I had kept the earphones in bag. The next morning I see the wire is broken from between. Even worse, this happened on the 8th day of buying the product and the return replacement policy for this product is only for 7 days. duped",1
Pratik,Good but doesn't fit in everyone's ears.,White,14-Mar-22,"It is a good product quality and sound wise given its selling price. But a major drawback is its design, it is not suitable for everyone's ears. It just didn't fit well into my ears and kept on coming out of the ears due to which I couldn't experience the best audio out of it and also it causes pain in the ears just after 30 mins of usage. Better to go with earphones that have silicon based buds.",3
Krishna Kumar,Stopped working after . months of usage,Blue,22-Nov-21,It was a decent earphone for the price but given that it stopped working after 2.5 months. Now the audio is heard very feebly in the earpieces and I have to raise my devices' volume to the maximum to hear what the other person is saying. Disappointed,1
Balakrishna,Best in price,White,11-Apr-22,The wire will not get a knot. You can fold and put in your pocket easily and when you want to use them take out without a single wire know. Sound quality is good. All I can say is this is best in it's price segment. Wire is long enough. What I thought is mic saegment should have been close to our mouth.,4
Amar,Value for money product.,Iguana,06-Jan-22,A value for money product. Not too good sound but according to the price there is quality.The main advantage is THIS PRODUCT IS REALLY STRONG INTANGIBLE DESIGN.you can go for it.,4
Richi,Built Quality is Very Low,Iguana,17-Sep-21,"from purchased with in a 2 weeks Coting on the wire peeled of, build quality is very low, Sound is Good and Comfortable in ear. boAt had replaced the product Thanks to boAt",3
MADHUSMITA KAR ,st time disappointed with Amazon product.,White,30-Apr-22,Nonsense product. As soon as I plug in my earphone the sound automatically increases and decreases. I don't know what's the reason. I can't even return as the return window closed.,1
Monika,Perfect,Black,20-Jun-21,I liked this product...Best stereo type earphone i ever got with 1 year warrant coverage.there's no nip and tuck competitor of this earphone... Every earphone brandsame as this model have high price or 6 month warrant coverage. Sound quality is good. Noise cancellation relatively average.. Value for money who's searching this model..,4
Chandra,Loved it,Spirit Lime,16-Sep-21,"Fit my ears perfectly. If you have issues fitting the bullet earphone in your ears, these earphones are for you The sound is amazing with good bass. Looks cool and sturdy",5
Dr Vinod Chebbi,"The left ear speaker is dying, and there is lot of echo",Blue,03-Dec-21,"To begin with it worked great. Within a month I found the following There is huge echo you hear your own voice getting back at you in full sentence And now, the left speaker has reduced its output and is feeble despite in full volume. Not a promising product.",1

Aravind Prasad R,"Do not buy this if intended for online classes, podcast, movies, etc.",Spirit Lime,08-Nov-21,"Using this headphones for about a couple of months now, I can say, this headphones feel as if someone turned that bass knob, all the way up to max.I have tried and compared this with at least 5 headphones ranging from apple ones, to cheap headphones.You wont feel much of a difference in Music, but while listening to voices, you may feel a bit uncomfortable.The voices sound too airy, to the point which sometimes you may have difficulty in understanding what is being spoken .Therefore, if you will be using headphones for online classes, watching movies, listening to radio, podcasts, or anything, with human speech often, then you may need to consider something else.Apart from that, everything about this headphones are fine., the build quality, fit, comfort, are all very good",3
