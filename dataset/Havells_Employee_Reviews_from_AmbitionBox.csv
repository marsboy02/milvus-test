Havells started with dealer channel which get directly supplied from the company. Here teammates are average in nature but few plays cheap politics for self growth, as a product head few get established brands and there Life will be easy & smooth at both the places like dealers & the Boss, coming to training part all have got appointed with experience not much of training required, job security and career growth is average again it depends on your product which you are handling and much with the relationship you have with your boss branch head. Salary & appraisal will be calculated based on your KRA but largely again it depends on your relationship with your boss branch heads. 
As the company depends & focus on product sales dependency is very high on frontline and the product head for that we need to travel extensively and need to maintain very close relationship with the dealers as the competition is very high there is high & easy chance of competition entering into the counter.
Politics has become very common in all the organisation but coming to sales & marketing we see very cheap politics bosses love to play cheap games between the employee and the lazy guys who doesn't want to work plays show off work by gaining soft corner. You have Learning chance for all but people who take it positively​ have scope otherwise the job is monotonous, we have office in all the HQ but very compact for having 20 odd divisions. All companies continue to grow with the innovation I rate Havells at average, for sale guys work life balance is very difficult, we have leave to avail but due to target pressure we cant avail....Read More","Company is good but unnecessary hierarchy structure for example if a Product Head is based out of Hyderabad incharge of Telangana he reports to Division Head, Branch Head and the National Product Head only for Sales, and Sales.
