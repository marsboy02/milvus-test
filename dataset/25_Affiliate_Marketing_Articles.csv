The future of gaming isn’t bright… it’s every shade of multidimensional dazzling.


This boom in gaming is supported by lightning-fast tech developments
,
 including in and around the metaverse. In addition, exciting new monetization models are being launched and gaining momentum.


It’s these three primary trends that make the future of gaming so awesome, but how and why? Let’s take a closer look.

1. The Expansion of Metaverse






Metaverse
 is a virtual world in which we can interact in various ways with both the environment and others.


It has a global reach and combines a range of tech, including VR (virtual reality), AR (augmented reality), AI (artificial intelligence), IoT (the internet of things), and blockchain transaction records.


There are thought to be several trends that are and will continue to be seen:




New opportunities: 
Although the current metaverse games and apps are powerful and seductive, future versions will be mind-blowing in their realism and application. The environments or spaces will be richer, and the interactive capabilities will be wider and more thrilling.


Multi-functional virtual spaces
: Currently, many of us associate metaverse with gaming, which, of course, includes an important social or interactive dimension. However, this 3-D cyberspace will become a place to work and earn an income, study, attend events for pleasure or business, trade, and network.


Realism
: The future of the metaverse will be an interconnected series of realistic and vibrant virtual worlds that will redefine online interactions and ownership.


Increasingly rich virtual experience
: Metaverse has already made it possible to interact with an environment and fellow gamers in a way that was not possible previously. With VR headsets, sensory features, 3-D images, and full display screens, the ‘realness’ and richness of the experience will continue to gather momentum and become increasingly immersive.


Increased autonomy
: Gamers and visitors to these virtual worlds or spaces also have a never-before-seen degree of autonomy. The metaverse-based virtual worlds or ecosystems can now be centralized or decentralized.




While gaming is enriched and shaped by the metaverse, gaming is central to the development of the metaverse. This is supported by 
97% of gaming executives
, who also recognize that their models must embrace this situation.


2. New Mind-Blowing Gear for Gamers






The astonishing progress in technology is allowing a change in the nature of gaming, not just the quality of games.


Gaming Laptops


Laptops for gamers
 are evolving both externally and internally. The shape and style of laptops will continue to develop to meet demands. If you want a chunky, angular laptop with lights, it will become available. If you prefer sleek, slim, and lightweight, the future will offer them too.


Pixel resolution will continue to become increasingly impressive, as will internal design that increases speed and overall performance. Laptops will become increasingly affordable, too, and will house evermore powerful processors.


Monitors


Monitors or screens are likely to continue to increase in size. Curved monitors add to the immersive experience thanks to impressive pixel resolution, vibrant colors, improved viewing angles and aspect ratios, and quick refresh rates.


It may be that monitors will be replaced at some stage by future generations of headsets, high-tech gaming arcades, and the computers of the future.


Controller, Gaming Mouse, and Keyboard Options


Some gamers choose to use a 
controller
 
when they play. The design of these devices has also become far more sophisticated and sleeker… and will continue to do so. Special controller kits will be designed for specific gamers.


Gaming performance relies on lightning-fast fingers and reactions. Your 
gaming mouse
 must respond to that. Mice that make use of dual-sensor systems, so they detect the smallest and quickest finger movements, will be freely available.


Keyboards
 
will be streamlined and focus on user comfort, ease of use, and aesthetics. Keyboards will be personalized with 3-D printed keycaps, light strips, and a design of your choice.


But, in the future, all this gear may well become redundant.


Sound


Sound is an essential part of gaming so that you can hear the game’s soundtrack and/or talk to your friends/team members. State-of-the-art soundbars, AI sound-optimization tech, and noise- and echo-canceling headphones have appeared, but the versions that are yet to come will take sound quality and immediacy to a whole new level.


3. New Monetization Opportunities






For Game Developers and Publishers


Game publishers will no longer generate most of their revenue through game sales, subscriptions, in-game purchases, and advertising.


Game developers/creators may increasingly monetize their games by acting independently rather than working through a gaming company or other third party to maximize their profits.


At the same time, new ways of monetizing NFTs within gaming will also be found in the future.


For Gamers


Blockchain gaming monetization is still in its infancy. These games, unlike traditional ones, are decentralized, so game assets are distributed among players. With some gamers operating the NTFs as the currency, it will bring new monetization opportunities.


NTFs will likely increase in value over time and be able to be traded, sold, or given away in a global virtual and real space.


Professional gamers with additional income sources (salaries, sponsorships, streaming, and prizes) will grow and evolve as metaverse and gaming do.


What is the Future of Gaming?


As a gamer, you will be able to move seamlessly from gameplay to social or commercial spaces and from the virtual to the physical world. Part of this seamless movement will be that the user’s wallet, identity, assets, avatar, and registration can move easily from one area and application to another.


The gaming and virtual world will become far more customizable and personalized. For instance, users will be able to create their own stories and characters’ personalities.


At the same time, VR and AR gaming arcades will become more prevalent. These large spaces will provide a safe environment to move in while gaming.


Finally, gamers will no longer age out but will continue their involvement, especially because gaming will become the foundation for broader experiences.


What will Gaming Look Like in 2030?


Our predictions, in addition to those above, are that:




Metaverse will become even more sophisticated, all-encompassing, and immersive.


Seamless movement across games and spaces will be achieved.


VR and AR experiences, gear, and arcades will be widespread and have broad gaming, social, and commercial applications.


New gear will be developed that will allow users to engage all their senses for a fully immersive experience.


While security measures like getting a browser VPN extension (
Surfshark VPN
 and such) will still be required to safeguard data and identity, the industry will improve data security to protect metaverse users.




Is Metaverse The Future of Gaming?


The quick answer is, “Yes, in all probability.” Every year gaming and the tech it and the metaverse rely on becomes more sophisticated and advanced.


There is also a strong overlap between the immersive virtual world of gaming and the physical or real world. For instance, if a gamer uses the same identity in the real world and all the virtual worlds they enter, they continue to exist in all of them even when they log off.


What will Computers be Like in 50 Years?


Our forecasts for computers are:




If Moore’s Law is correct and the computer’s processing power doubles every two years (and assuming engineers can keep up!), computers will have utterly staggering processing speeds.


Computers may not look like computers and might be, in a sense, invisible. We enter the realm of pervasive computing, where a computer can be built into anything: clothing, eyewear, body implants, highways, buildings, mirrors, etc.


With mega processing speeds, seamless movement in the Metaverse, and built-in computers, the world may become a massive computing system where the real and the virtual merge.


We will move from information transmission by photons rather than wires or cables. Data will be transmitted by light as it is in fiber optics, but this could occur inside a computer too, again making a physical computer unnecessary.


Monitors will also become defunct (or optional) as you will be able to display data and images on any surface. In addition, touch-screen capabilities will mean that the mouse and keyboard are also obsolete.




Overall, it’s safe to say that we are unlikely to recognize, or even find, the computer in 50 years’ time!


Final Thoughts


The current gaming industry trends impact gear, metaverse, and new monetization opportunities. The future for gamers and users is astounding.


We will experience seamless movement from gameplay to social or commercial spaces and from the virtual to the physical world. Thanks to the rapid evolution of metaverse, AR, and VR, our merging virtual and real world will become more customizable, and assets and identities will be portable.


Computers, monitors, and other gear will be unrecognizable and form a fully integrated part of our world and daily life.

Why and How to Lock Mac Keyboard,https://10beasts.com/why-how-lock-mac-keyboard/,"



The sleek, shiny, and smooth design of Mac computers draws the attention of every person. This includes adults, small children, and even pets. But letting anyone use your Mac device might be risky.


You can easily prevent interference on your Mac screen in multiple ways. But how to lock Mac keyboard
 
to prevent any unwanted changes – whether those are changes to some important documents, or when you are playing a game or doing some work? This guide will help you with figuring out how to lock your Mac keyboard, whatever the reason is.

Why Lock Your Mac Keyboard?


There are multiple reasons you might want to lock your Mac keyboard, ranging from having pets or small kids roaming around. By locking your keyboard you can avoid any unwanted changes. 


Another reason is wanting to 
clean your keyboard
. Keyboards easily pick up grease, dust, grime, and dirt. Constant contact with your hands can make them dirty and unhygienic. You don’t need to turn off your Mac completely to clean its keyboard. You can simply lock the keyboard to disable the keys. 


Yet another reason is wanting to prevent keyboard input while watching a movie.


What Is a Keyboard Lock?


Mac devices have a Keyboard Lock feature to temporarily turn off the keyboard input. This feature is useful when you don’t want your work to be disrupted due to accidental keystrokes. You can buy a wireless or wired keyboard with an integrated keyboard lock feature. But 
this feature has some flaws
 and does not always work properly.


Also, some MacBook keyboard layouts come without a dedicated lock key. To share your Mac keyboard on MacBook or another Apple device, you can use the 
Universal Control
 feature. To temporarily disable a keyboard, get a wireless or a wired 
keyboard
.


Use the Lock Screen Option






The simplest method to lock your MacBook keyboard is to do it manually. This method will work for any Mac device. Move the cursor on the screen’s top left corner and tap on the Apple icon. Now, click on Lock Screen from the appearing menu.


You will see that your Mac screen is locked. So, input your Mac password or use your Touch ID to sign back in. This trick will help you to protect your device against unnecessary changes in the text fields or purchases. It would not lock the keyboard completely.


Use the Keyboard Shortcut


If you are interested in learning how to lock Mac keyboard
 
completely, use the keyboard shortcut. It will help you in locking the keyboard as well as the Mac screen. Tap the Control + Command + Q keys for locking.


Once you press this keyboard shortcut or combination, you will move to a lock screen. Here, you will have to either type your system password or use your Touch ID to log in again. It will effectively lock the screen and keyboard on the MacBook.  


Ways to Lock a Mac Keyboard


Another method to lock your MacBook keyboard consists of just a few options. First, you have to simply close the lid. Now, you can use the keyword combination of the Control, Shift, and Power keys to lock your MacBook.


Press the Command, Option, and Power keys to put your machine to sleep mode. Go to the Apple menu and select the Sleep option. You can also close the lid to bring your MacBook to sleep. Press the keyboard combo of Control, Shift, and Power to lock your MacBook.


Why Disable Keys for Keyboard Cleaning?






Traditionally a keyboard cleaning is a simple process of turning off the machine. Users could turn off their MacBook by tapping Apple and then the Shutdown button. They need to clean the keyboard without turning on their MacBook.


But, for the modern MacBook, this method is no longer required. This is because any keystroke on the latest Mac computers can cause the device to start booting. It is no longer possible to open the lid without waking up a system. 


Is It Good to Use Third-Party Apps?


There are numerous apps that are considered worth downloading to manage the Mac keyboard and system. These apps lock the keyboard of Mac laptops while allowing the display to keep running.


This would be helpful when you require to watch videos without needing a Mac keyboard. These apps may stop working as your Mac system updates. Hence, you may not be able to lock your keyboard. The above methods will lock the keyboard as well as the entire system.

Best Razer Mouse: Top 10 Reviewed and Rated Mice for 2022,https://10beasts.com/best-razer-mouse/,"



We have all heard of Razer before. There’s even a possibility that you have owned a Razer mouse or its other peripherals, especially if you are a gamer. If so, you must have wondered which is the best Razer mouse out there?


Along with Logitech and Corsair, Razer dominates the gaming gear market. But if you are a hardcore Razer fan, you know that they have been doing this since the beginning. Mice, such as the 
Basilisk v2
 and the 
Razer DeathAdder V2
, have shaken the industry to its core, innovating and establishing new standards for those around them.


In fact, the first-ever gaming mouse was developed and manufactured by Razer, way back in 1999, it was called the Razer Boomslang. Later they innovated the mouse by adding a light encoder and a new sensor to create the first pro gaming mouse, the Diamondback, released in 2005.


Since then, Razer has continued to be on the up and up, replacing the old mechanical switch with an optical mouse switch. Manufacturing more gaming mice with an optical sensor instead of a laser one.


Personally, I have been a fan of Razer since the beginning of my gaming career, that is to say, since I was a child. Back then, Razer had really gotten into the mainstream and was all over the place. I even remember asking my mother for a new Razer gaming mouse for Christmas.


It might seem silly now, but back then, I truly liked Razer’s epic logo and RGB lighting, so basically, I liked that my mouse glowed with pretty colors. Cut me some slack. I was young, I didn’t know about DPI, switches, or button customization. 


But now that I know all these things, I appreciate Razer even more. That’s why I decided to set out on this journey of finding the best Razer mouse. Won’t you join me for a ride?

There is a reason why Razer has become a household name worldwide. They have been a part of the gaming industry since, well, since the beginning. They have continued to push the gaming boundaries ever since. The Razer Naga Trinity mouse is no exception; it challenges what it means to be a gaming mouse. More precisely, an MMO mouse with its unique and innovative design.


The Trinity is part of the Razer Naga series, and it is accurately named. The gaming mouse has three separate thumb panels, which you can switch between just as easily as removing a magnet. From the typical 12-panel thumb button to a more focused MOBA gaming mouse, it is similar to the Naga Hex. It even has a 2 button panel design for FPS games. The Razer Naga Trinity essentially gives you three different mice in one for a reasonable price, if I might add.


Now, if you are a big fan of Razer, you probably wonder why that design sounds so familiar. Razer Naga Trinity is not the first gaming mouse to have done the whole’ 3 different side panel’ thing. Before the Naga Trinity came the 
Razer Naga Pro
, although this gaming mouse was not nearly as well-executed as the Trinity. Even though they are both parts of the Razer Naga series, the Trinity improves on almost every aspect of the Naga Pro. 


The Razer Naga Trinity MMO gaming mouse is easily considered by some to be the best MMO mouse out there. The scroll wheel, the thumb buttons, and the Razer logo underneath your palm have RGB lighting, which you can change via Razer’s Synapse software. 


As for the thumb panel itself, well, it’s kept in place by some mighty magnets. The panels are easily removable but will stay in place unless you want to remove them.


The first panel is your typical 12 button MMO mouse, the second is a collection of 7 buttons arranged in a circular pattern, similar to the Naga Hex, as mentioned before. When I tested the 7 button panel, I was astonished at how drastically it improved my performance in League of Legends. The 7 buttons are ideal for MOBA games. They are not too many, like in a 12 button MMO mouse, and not too few like in an FPS mouse. To be honest, I am surprised that more brands have not done similar designs. The only other example I can think of is, as mentioned before, the Naga Hex and Naga Hex V2.


This Razer device is mainly for people interested in MMO gaming rather than general gaming. The 2 button side panel does not have RGB lighting and is lighter than the other two. Even so, I would not pick the Razer Naga Trinity above other dedicated FPS mice.


One of the reasons why I would not use it strictly for FPS games is that the mouse is too tall and heavy, even with all of the side panels removed (which is not recommended). Other than that, the gaming mouse is not recommended for people with small hands or fingertip grips. However, the ergonomic mouse itself is actually very comfortable. Still, the overall feel will change depending on which button panel you use.


The Razer Naga mouse is covered in solid plastic, and it feels smooth to touch. The mouse feet are made of PTFE, as is the standard, nothing out of the ordinary here. As for the cable, well, it’s a bit rigid and not very flexible, but it is braided and will last you a long time.


While the optical sensor is actually a proprietary one called the Razer 5G, with a minimum rating of 100 and a maximum of 16000, with 2 buttons right beneath the scroll wheel meant to adjust the DPI setting on the go. The sensor is excellent, and I had no issues while testing the mouse.


I tried the Razer Naga mouse out on a couple of game titles, such as Overwatch, Warcraft, World of Warcraft, and League of Legends. The device performed pretty well for the FPS side of things, but still, I would prefer a much smaller, lighter FPS mouse for FPS games. It truly shines in the MMO and MOBA side of things, this Razer mouse was obviously made for those types of games, and it shows. Improving on the Naga Hex, the Trinity’s MOBA thumb buttons feel way more satisfying to the touch and will last you way longer. As for World of Warcraft, the mouse performed as expected. My brother is a big MMO fan, and I plan to get the Naga Trinity for his birthday. I would recommend this mouse to any MMO players out there.

The Razer Basilisk V2 is one of the newer gaming mice released by the company, along with a few variations, including a budget and a wireless Basilisk V2, called the 
Razer Basilisk Ultimate
, but more on that later. For now, the Razer Basilisk V2 is a good all-rounder mouse for your everyday gaming needs. However, it’s a little more expensive than you would think, especially for a wired mouse.


The Basilisk V2 is quite similar to its cousin, the 
Razer DeathAdder V2
. This ergonomic mouse has angular strips of plastic intersecting on its face and textured grips on both sides, while an extended thumb rest appears on the left side of the gaming mouse. It’s a pretty comfortable design, and the mouse feet glide as smooth as a figure skater on ice. Although it would be a little too big for people with smaller hands and fingertip grip users.


This mouse is a part of the Basilisk series and, as such, has a small extra thumb button called a DPI clutch, which, as you can probably guess, is mainly used for the DPI setting. Still, you can also use it to access the secondary button profile when you hold it, essentially doubling the number of programmable buttons at your disposal. The button, in my opinion, is handy, but don’t worry, if you don’t want to use it, you can simply remove it and replace it with a rubber stopper.


An adventure unfolds when you flip the gaming mouse over. The first thing you will see is a dial used for the customizable scroll wheel resistance, which is exactly what it sounds like. Simply adjust the dial, and you will go from cycling spells in mere nano-seconds to taking your time with each one. However, there is no way to gauge the resistance apart from trial and error. This is not the first nor last time a scroll wheel resistance feature has been implemented. Still, arguably some other devices have done a better job at it, *cough* Logitech mouse *cough*. But that doesn’t mean the feature is not appreciated here. I love it when gaming mice have scroll wheel resistance and often wonder why more devices don’t.


As for the programmable buttons, well, they are pretty similar to previous Basilisk models. You have your left button, right button, some scroll wheel action, and 2 buttons on the face of the mouse, which can also be used to adjust DPI. On the side, above the thumb rest, there are 2 thumb buttons in addition to the clutch, as mentioned earlier. These are, of course, your standard FPS buttons.


The Razer Basilisk V2 is equipped with the Focus+ optical sensor, which can go as high as 20,000 DPI and has a 50g acceleration. The gaming mouse also has five onboard profiles, which is way more than you need if you ask me, but if you are playing and traveling a lot, I guess it could be useful. You can use a button on the mouse’s underside to switch between profiles or simply reprogram to a more convenient one.


All in all, this gaming mouse has a total of 11 programmable buttons, which you can remap with the Razer Synapse software. You can also use the program to adjust the RGB lighting as well as the DPI of the mouse and some other complicated settings. But the software itself gives off this feeling that it’s way more complex than it needs to be; however, once you get used to it, it’s a walk in the park.


I tested the Basilisk V2 in Overwatch, Cyberpunk 2077, and World of Warcraft. It performed adorably on all of the titles. The extra buttons were beneficial in Overwatch for all the different abilities, and Cyberpunk 2077 was a lot of fun despite the bugs. Although the buttons were not nearly enough for an MMORPG like WoW, it was still pretty decent. Unless you are a hardcore MMO gamer, I don’t see any problems you could face while using this mouse for World of Warcraft or any other MMORPG game.

Some say wireless mice are the future; some think they will never surpass the wired mouse. Whatever may be the case, you cannot deny that the Razer Basilisk Ultimate is a damn fine mouse to have. 


In almost every regard, the Razer Basilisk Ultimate is similar to its brother, the Basilisk V2. But with some improvements and a lot steeper price. In fact, I think this is one of the most expensive wireless mice currently in the market.


The Basilisk Ultimate is a thing of beauty; for right-handed people, that is, lefties should take a look at the 
Razer Viper
 instead. The Basilisk Ultimate has an ergonomic design with a smooth face, textured grip, and of course, a thumb rest.


The mouse buttons are nothing you haven’t seen before. The obvious left, right-click, and scroll wheel are all there. I still haven’t seen a mouse without those three buttons, but is it really a mouse if it doesn’t have them? There are also the 2 face buttons used for the DPI setting and the 2 thumb buttons, which you can program however you would like, but there is also a strange stud that looks like a paddle on the side. That weird stud is more widely known as the signature multi-function paddle. As the name suggests, its functions are only limited by your imagination. I personally use it as a sniper button, where it slows the DPI when you hold it down. But if the paddle is not your thing, you can easily remove it and replace it with a small rubber grip. 


When you flip the mouse over, you will find a profile switching button and a button to adjust the scroll wheel resistance. With the Basilisk V2, Razer dropped the ball a little when it comes to these features. Ok, you might not 
need
 to switch profiles on the fly. Still, I can see the need for the customizable scroll wheel resistance when you are in the middle of a game; for example, it would come in handy for weapon selects. Although you can assign one of the other programmable buttons to this task, that’s one less button for other functions.


Like most Razer mice, the Basilisk Ultimate comes with the Razer Synapse software. It allows you to change the RGB lighting, adjust the 11 programmable buttons, and create game profiles. You’ve heard it all before, I’m sure.


Where this mouse truly shines, however, is in its wireless functionality and battery life. By Razer’s estimation, you can reach 100 hours of battery if you turn off all the RGB lighting. Personally, I am a big fan of the fact that my mouse glows and am extremely happy that humanity has reached this point, so I opted to keep them on. My mouse lasted about 20 hours, and depending on how much you play, I can imagine the number bumping up to 25 or more. When the battery begins to falter, the RGB light on the bottom will change color and alert you of the impending doom. Oh, did I mention that you can charge the wireless mouse while gaming? The charging dock is also pretty nice to have, but it will cost you a little extra.


I tested the Razer mouse out in Overwatch. The sniper button or signature multi-function paddle was a big help in getting headshots with Widowmaker. The mouse also worked perfectly with Call of Duty, and it was not that bad with World of Warcraft and The Witcher 3. But that’s expected, given that this is marketed as an FPS mouse.

 Amazing customization


 Long battery life

The Razer Viper gaming mouse is targeted towards people who want to break into the world of esports. Although that’s a particular demographic, this mouse works for everyone. Whether you are a new gamer, a veteran, or a leftie, and I am not talking about your political leanings. The Razer Viper is the first of the Viper sisters, followed by the 
Mini
 and 
Ultimate
, which are considered the wireless gaming mice version of the former.


The Razer Viper mouse is has a sleek and ambidextrous design, not to mention minimalistic; however, it’s full of subtle touches. There are textured grips on either side and slight curves for a more ergonomic feel. Overall the mouse is just comfortable to hold, and you will need to try it yourself to fully understand.


The 8 programmable buttons are separated symmetrically on the entire ambidextrous mouse. There are the usual right and left-click buttons, a scroll wheel, 2 thumb buttons on either side and a DPI stud under the mouse. All of the programmable buttons are equipped with a Razer optical mouse switch, which in all honesty, is way better than that old traditional mechanical switch. Trust me, I’ve been using gaming mice for a long time. Anyway, the modern optical mouse switch feels satisfying and comfortable to use, and I am happy with the feel of all the buttons, apart from the scroll wheel. I don’t know what happened there, but I would expect much better for a Razer mouse as expensive as this one.


The scroll wheel feels stiff and uncomfortable even during everyday use, like when browsing Reddit. It was even worse when switching between weapons in FPS games, and there is nothing you can do to adjust its resistance or speed.


What you can adjust, though, is all the other buttons and RGB lighting with the Synapse software. Make the mouse glow with pretty patterns, or calibrate it to whatever you use as a mouse pad. You can also create unique profiles for specific games and sync them with other Razer peripherals. Or, if you would prefer, you can store the profiles in the mouse’s onboard memory.


This Razer mouse uses the 5G optical sensor with a maximum DPI of 16,000 and a 99.4% tracking accuracy. The 5G is not the worst sensor out there, but I feel like the Focus+ is better.


Now, since this is marketed as an esports mouse, I decided to test it out on some esports titles. The Razer Viper gaming mouse worked almost perfectly in CS: GO, its lightweight design made fast movements and flicks feel natural, but the scroll wheel was a pain, as mentioned before. The mouse also worked well with StarCarft II, where I zerg rushed some unlucky Protoss.


To test out the ambidextrous design, I gave the mouse to my left-handed friend Tim, who tried playing League of Legends and Call of Duty with it. He loved it so much I let him keep it, so it definitely has his seal of approval.

Finally, a mouse that speaks to my soul. Unlike its other brothers, the Razer Viper Mini, true to its name, is designed specifically for people with smaller hands and those who like to travel. Part of the Viper series, this mouse is made for ultra-lightweight gaming. It sheds some of the more unnecessary features of other similar mice.


First off, the Razer Viper Mini is around an inch smaller than most gaming mice, making it one of the most miniature mice I have ever reviewed or used. Although it’s a little uncomfortable to hold for players with large hands, at least now they will know how we small hand folk feel. But if you are using a claw grip and have big hands, this mouse will be a little more comfortable to hold. As for people with smaller hands, any grip is fine, yes, even the fingertip grip.


The Razer Viper Mini gaming mouse has a pretty standard slim design, with slight indentations on either side; you won’t find anything out of the ordinary here. However, there is a problem that I simply cannot overlook. Razer has marketed this mouse as an ambidextrous mouse. The truth is that while the design can fit comfortably in both hands, there are thumb buttons only on the left side. So this gaming mouse falls more into the category of “false-ambidextrous”. Other than the 2 thumb buttons, there’s also a left and right-click button and a scroll wheel. There is also a single face button that adjusts custom DPI settings. All of the programmable buttons are equipped with a Razer optical mouse switch, which utilizes an infrared light beam to register every click.


As for the mouse feet, they are a little more durable than most Razer mice and significantly contribute to that smooth mouse movement we all enjoy. Then there is the Razer Viper Mini’s cable; honestly, it’s one of the best on this list. Known as the Speedflex cable, it’s designed to be very flexible and produce minimal drag.


Like most Razer mice, the Viper Mini utilizes the Razer Synapse software for customization. With it, you can adjust all the programmable buttons and the RGB lighting. You can even play with some dynamic lighting effects, but I will leave you to discover those on your own.


The gaming mouse also has an 8500 DPI optical sensor, which admittedly is not as much as other mice, but let’s be honest, do you really need a DPI of 20000? I didn’t think so. In my opinion, 8500 is more than enough.
I tested this mouse in Overwatch, and the low weight and smaller form made it very easy to flash in and out of the battlefield with Tracer as I was taking potshots.


I also tried the gaming mouse with The Witcher 3 and World of Warcraft. Although it performed pretty well, in the end, this lightweight mouse is best suited for FPS games. Plus, some hardcore MMO players might not be too happy with the lack of buttons.

It’s hard to be a left-handed gamer, I understand. There are far too few ambidextrous mice and even fewer for left-handed people. You can’t even use some of the best mice on the market, like the Razer Deathadder V2. Still, it has never been better for lefties. More and more ambidextrous mice are coming out from established brands, and the Razer Viper Ultimate is no exception.


This gaming mouse might look a bit strange to some people, but that doesn’t mean it’s not comfortable. It has a wonderful wireless setup and a completely symmetrical design. Two thumb buttons rest on either side, and a long grip sits on the palm rest, which takes up most of the mouse, making it perfect for palm grip and fingertip grip users.
The mouse feet are made from 100% PTFE and glide smoothly on most surfaces, especially on a mouse pad. As for the cable, it’s flexible and has minimum drag; we all know that Razer doesn’t always have the best cables, but this one is an exception.


The Razer Viper Ultimate’s charging dock also deserves a mention as it can make your desktop shine. In addition to charging the mouse when you are not using it, the dock also has an RGB lighting strip on the bottom. You can sync your other Razer gear, such as your Razer mouse or gaming keyboard. Thanks to friction, the dock will stay firmly in place; however, the feet are not sticky, so you can pick it up and move it as many times as you would like.


I have tested numerous wireless mice throughout my years of gaming and reviewing, most of which had below-average connectivity. Very few were as good as a wired mouse. The Razer Viper Ultimate is one of those few.


The wireless performance and battery life of this Razer mouse are among the biggest reasons that make it the best Razer wireless mouse. I spent a week with the Viper Ultimate, and in those days, I did not encounter a single delay, lag, or dropped signal. As for the battery? It lasted for around 5 days with constant usage and RGB lighting. But here we encounter one of the issues with this Razer mouse, charging with the dock takes a long time, around 4 hours. 


Now, this would not be a problem if you could charge the mouse overnight; however, the dock requires a lot of power, so unless you plug it in a wall outlet, which will be challenging considering it doesn’t come with an adapter, you will have to let your PC run during the night, which is something I really don’t enjoy doing. But honestly, unless you are constantly gaming, I’m sure you will find 4 hours to spare during the day, so I don’t see this as a big issue.


Like most Razer mice, the Viper Ultimate runs on the Synapse software. Which can let you adjust the 8 programmable buttons and the RGB lighting and DPI settings, among other things.


With its optical sensor, the gaming mouse promises a 99.6% resolution accuracy, a minimum DPI rating of 100, and a maximum of 20,000. Personally, I think the 99.6% is a bit of an overkill. Still, I can see it becoming relevant in the future as graphic cards and games improve over time.


I tested this Razer optical mouse on several titles, and it performed admirably on all of them. I was able to pillage and plunder without a problem in Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla and rain-down rockets with Phara in Overwatch. If you are searching for a wireless mouse that can be your gaming partner for a long while, I recommend this one. However, it does lack the necessary buttons for MMORPGs.

Before the Razer Viper Ultimate came to power, the wireless market was dominated by another Razer mouse – which had quite an expensive price tag attached to it – the Razer Mamba Wireless. Don’t worry though, since then its price has decreased substantially. While it is still near the top of the wireless gaming world, this Razer mouse is not as good as some other Razer peripherals. Its age is showing.


The Razer Mamba has an ergonomic design and is not ambidextrous. Rubber grips line both sides, and to be honest, they look like large wires going in and out of the mouse. Other than that, there is nothing unusual about the design, and the Razer Mamba itself works well with both the palm grip and claw grip; sadly no fingertip grip support here.
The wireless gaming mouse has a total of 7 programmable buttons. Of course, there are the left and right-click and the scroll wheel. As well as 2 buttons used for the DPI setting and 2 thumb buttons on the left side. All buttons are equipped with Razer mechanical mouse switches and feel comfortable to press.


According to Razer, a single mouse switch can endure 50 million clicks. I am ashamed to say that I couldn’t press every single button 50 million times in the week I had to review this mouse. Still, I am inclined to believe them, as Razer has rarely disappointed in the past.


The mouse feet are also above average, and they should glide well enough even if you don’t own a mouse mat. As for the USB cable, yes, I said cable. After all, this wireless gaming mouse can also be used as a wired one. You see, the Razer Mamba doesn’t rely on a dock for transmitting signals; instead, it uses a USB receiver with a small dongle stored in the snake’s belly. An extension USB cable will allow you to play while charging if you are tired of the wireless connection and prefer a wired one. Although the USB cable is a bit rigid and not very flexible, I believe we can excuse that since this is mainly a wireless mouse.


The connection is pretty solid, and I did not encounter any lag or latency issues with the Razer mouse itself when I was testing it. The battery is also pretty great with a life of up to 50 hours; this is, of course, with the RGB lighting turned off.


As with most other Razer mice, the Razer Mamba Wireless comes with the Razer Synapse software. Which you can use to change the color of the RGB lighting in the scroll wheel and the logo on the palm rest and play some dynamic lighting effects. You can also customize profiles and sync the Razer mouse with your Razer keyboard or any other Razer products.


As for its performance, the gaming mouse has an acclaimed sensor called the Razer 5G Advanced. The optical sensor has up to 16000 DPI and is very precise. Although I still prefer the Focus+ to any other.


I tested this Razer mouse in Rocket League, Sea of Thieves, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Overwatch. The mouse worked well with all the titles in both wireless and wired mode. The extra buttons came in handy when playing Overwatch, as they quite often do, and they were a surprisingly big help in Sea of Thieves and Red Dead Redemption 2. However, the mouse was uncomfortable during those long gaming sessions. 


I noticed a slight difference in the response time of the mechanical switch as opposed to the Razer optical mouse switch, but that’s just me. For the typical consumer, you won’t see much of a difference.

Not many people know that Razer doesn’t strictly make gaming gear. Heck, I was astonished when I found this out a while back. Yet, with the Razer Pro Click, they have shown that they can not only dominate the gaming gear industry but also innovate your home office.


I like having different mice for my work and leisure time, i.e., gaming sessions. When I have to write an article such as this, I go to my Macbook Pro and plug in the Razer Pro Click, which has a stunning design, if I might add. With its beautiful design – I’d go so far as to call it elegant – and its precisely engineered ergonomics, you’re going to be hard-pressed to find a better mouse for your home or office for the price.


The Pro Click mouse, along with the Razer Pro Glide (wireless keyboard) and the RazerPro Type (wireless keyboard), are part of the same series, which was designed with the help of Humanscale, a manufacturer that focuses on office ergonomics.


As for the Razer Pro Click itself, it’s a wireless mouse with what can only be described as the most comfortable design that Razer has ever produced. That doesn’t mean the mouse doesn’t have any competition, though. In fact, the Pro Click mouse was released as a response to the MX Master by Logitech, which has quickly become its main rival, at least in the eyes of the community.


The Razer Pro Click has been specifically engineered for better arm posture. It achieves that by keeping the user’s wrist at a 30-degree angle, as the oval shape curves under the palm and keeps your wrist from anchoring to the work surface. As a result, you use fewer muscles, and your arm is not as tired after a long day.


The wireless mouse has an almost creamy white look with textured grips running along each side. As for the scroll wheel? It’s made from a textured metal alloy that looks and feels really satisfying to use.


Now I know what you might be thinking. How can it be a Razer mouse if it’s not black and glowing? It may not look like a Razer mouse, but it certainly has the feel of one.


There are a total of 8 programmable buttons. The three obvious ones are the left and right-click and the mouse wheel, and 2 more thumb buttons on the left side. When you flip the mouse over, you’ll find a switch that will allow you to activate either wireless or Bluetooth connectivity.


The Pro Click also has the Razer 5G optical sensor, the same one used in most Razer gaming mice. It has a maximum DPI of 16,000 and a 99.4% tracking accuracy, making this the best and most responsive office mouse out there. Yes, even more than the Logitech MX Master, at least in my opinion.


Seeing as this is a wireless mouse, you would probably like to know more about the connectivity, right? Well, I will start by saying that the Pro Click has multi-host connectivity. That means you can pair it up with 4 devices and conveniently switch between your Desktop, TV, Android tablet, or Macbook Pro with just one click.


The wireless mouse is charged via a micro USB cable, which is pretty standard. The thing is that Razer has decided to take a page out of Apple’s playbook and made that micro USB one of a kind. So if you lose it, well, tough luck, buddy. I really dislike when companies do this, but the positives outweigh the negatives when you consider the mouse as a whole.


As for the USB dongle, it is stored in the belly of the mouse under a plastic cover, which is relatively easy to remove. Then there is the battery, it will last you a maximum of 400 hours, which means you can charge it once and forget about it for more than 2 weeks. Which admittedly is not as much battery life as the Logitech MX Master, but it’s still pretty darn good.


I realize that this is not a gaming mouse, but as mentioned before, I have been using it for some time now. That being said, this was the first time ever that I used it for gaming. I can make tons of excuses that I wanted to see how long the extended battery life could last and test the limits of the mouse. But in truth, I just wanted to play some games. It’s fair to say, that for an office mouse, the Razer Pro Click performed pretty well.


 
 
Pros
 




 Multi-host connectivity


 Comfortable


 Great performance & customization

So far in this review, we have covered several gaming mice of different shapes and sizes. We have even had one office mouse. But what about a gaming mouse specifically marketed towards Laptop users? The Razer Atheris is a wireless mouse with impressive battery life and a surprisingly affordable price.


The gaming mouse is actually one of Razer’s smallest devices. However, when you add the weight of the AA batteries is not particularly light. There is nothing usual about the design of this wireless mouse. It has a pocket-sized ergonomic body with a plain, smooth surface and a rubber grip on both sides. Even the logo on the palm rest is not too standoffish; instead, it blends in almost perfectly with the mouse itself.


I simply love the minimalistic and compact design of this mouse. I have had its small pocket-sized ergonomic body with me on numerous trips, and it’s my go-to mouse when I am on the road. With this being a small, compact Razer mouse, there is no point in comparing it with the 
Razer Viper Mini
. Still, even though this is another small gaming mouse, I would argue that it’s not as portable as the Razer Atheris.


But there is one flaw with the design of the Razer Atheris wireless mouse, and that is, it takes some getting used to. The mouse itself might not be comfortable to hold once you first start using it, the side grips feel a bit weird, and my hand started feeling stiff after a while. But like I said, once some time has passed, and you have got used to the feel of this mouse, you won’t have any issues.


The Razer Atheris mouse, of course, has a left-click, a right-click, and a scroll wheel. As well as a DPI button and 2 thumb buttons. All of which are pretty standard and feel satisfying to click.


Where this mouse truly shines, however, is in its connectivity. The Razer Atheris can connect with your PC via a wireless dongle or Bluetooth. While the former is generally considered the better connection, I found that both worked perfectly well.


But unlike the Razer Pro Click, this wireless mouse cannot be used on a phone or tablet. Still, Razer’s proprietary wireless technology is one of a kind, and this mouse, with its industry-leading signal stability, will let you work uninterrupted in cafes or any other public area, like an airport, where multiple wireless devices can interfere, especially with a Bluetooth connection.


The AA batteries on this wireless mouse can last you up to 300 hours, which is pretty impressive considering its pocket-sized ergonomic body. But not everything can be perfect, and as you can imagine, the mouse is cumbersome for its size. I see this being a problem for some people but not for others. It definitely bothered me at first, but like the design and feel, I barely noticed anything once I got used to it.


Other than that, the wireless mouse has a 7200 DPI optical sensor, and the Synapse 3 software provides it with some gaming-grade features.


I tested this mobile mouse while on the road in Rogue Company, Outward, and Overwatch. It performed well enough in the FPS and RPG titles, although I would not recommend gaming with it for too long, at least in the beginning. In the end, I would suggest anyone who is traveling a lot to get this mouse, whether you will use it for work or gaming.

 Mobile productivity mouse


 Solid connection


 Incredible control

Although it is easily considered the best Razer mouse out there, the Razer DeathAdder V2 has nothing new or innovative. It just does everything so well that people can’t help but love it. Considered by many to be the epitome of gaming mice and improving on the already existing design of the Razer DeathAdder Elite, this mouse, in my opinion, is not the best one ever released, but is more like an example and standard that all brands should strive to achieve.


The Razer DeathAdder V2 has a curved ergonomic design with textured grips on both sides. The gaming mouse is on the larger side and not suitable for smaller hands; you will need to look to the Razer DeathAdder V2 mini, which is precisely what it sounds like and made specifically for smaller hands. The DeathAdder proper, however, is suitable for all hand grips.


This ergonomic mouse has a hydrophobic material, making it easier to grasp during long gaming sessions. That coupled with the mouse’s Virgin Grade PTFE feet, which are one of the best mouse feet you can find, its light body, and its flexible braided cable with minimum drag makes this one of the best mice for those long gaming hours.


The button layout is nothing you haven’t seen before. You have your typical programmable buttons, the left, right, and middle-click, along with 4 additional ones, 2 on the left side, and 2 behind the scroll wheel for the DPI settings.


One really cool feature of the Razer DeathAdder is that you can store up to 5 onboard profiles. Perfect for anytime you don’t have access to your computer. Of course, it has some additional profile storage on the Razer Synapse software, which you can also use to change the RGB lighting on the scroll wheel and on the Razer logo beneath your palm.
With the Synapse software, you can create your own lighting patterns or sync the mouse with other Razer gear, like a gaming keyboard. But that could be a little daunting as the Synapse has a steep learning curve, don’t get me wrong, this is a good program but not necessarily a simple one.


The DeathAdder V2 also has Razer’s brand new optical sensor called the Focus+, which has a minimum of 100 and a maximum DPI of 20,000. I doubt you will ever need to set it that high, but it’s an excellent option, and even at a lower setting, the sensor is still precise and accurate.


I tested the mouse in Overwatch. Shifting the DPI on the fly was so easy I could spend one match zipping around as Tracer, while the next carefully lining up my shot as Widowmaker. I also had as much fun building up my orc army in Warcraft as I did slaying monsters in The Witcher 3. I see this mouse becoming a staple for any gamer, especially FPS players, but maybe not so much for MMO gamers. I don’t see the Razer DeathAdder V2 being picked up by any hardcore MMO gamers as it lacks the necessary buttons for those types of games. But other than that, I would recommend this Razer mouse to anyone.


 
 
Pros
 




 Very responsive


 Comfortable


 Precise




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Not ideal for smaller hands




 
 
 


Honorable Mentions


That was a Razer sharp ride if I have ever written one….. I will now see myself out. But in all seriousness, there are a few Razer mice that I just couldn’t add to the list for one reason or another, these are the ones that may be just as good, if slightly less so, but still deserve a mention. Nothing surprising or unusual here though.


Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed


The Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed has a design that feels similar to the 
Razer Basilisk Ultimate
. Where it differs is in the fact that this is a wireless mouse. It has an affordable price and a battery life of 450 hours in Bluetooth mode. But its build quality may not be on par with its brothers.


Razer DeathAdder Essential


This is a mouse that follows the DeathAdder tradition. The Razer DeathAdder Essential has a comfortable design that fits all hand sizes and grip styles, it has an optical sensor of a maximum of 6400 DPI and a build that’s made for FPS games. But stiff competition and the availability of better mice might make some people choose to skip this one.


Razer Naga Pro


Ah, the grandfather of the Trinity. The Razer Naga Pro is well built and comfortable to hold, like the Trinity, it has 3 sets of side panels, although they are not as well made. While this MMO mouse was great for its time, the Razer Naga Trinity improves on almost every aspect. But the Naga Pro still has something that the young upstart does not, wireless technology. 


Methodology


As I mentioned before, I am a big Razer fan. Some might even call me a fanboy… My dad, my dad calls me that. As such, I have a lot of old Razer mice in my parent’s home, most of which sadly did not make the list. Those that did, I plugged into my computer and started testing. Luckily none of them were broken, and I got to relive my childhood.
I was even more excited when I got around to buying the other Razer mice that I needed for the review. Ask my girlfriend, I was like a child on Christmas morning. Of course, I did not buy every single gaming mouse on this list, as much as I wish I could, I am not a bank. Some I rented, some I borrowed, and some I already owned, like the Razer Pro Click and Razer Atheris.


While testing, I wrote all of my findings in a little green notebook, and in the end, I compiled everything into this review. I was also curious as to what my colleagues on the internet had to say, so I went on to read a couple of reviews myself. This by no means influenced my opinion of the gaming mice. I’m simply a curious guy. What I did find is that some opinions we share and some we don’t, and that’s just part of being human.


Buyers Guide


I know how difficult it can be to find a good mouse, heck, even Razer has some sub-par devices. That’s why I wrote this section so that I can tell you what you should look out for when it comes to buying a brand new gaming mouse. Well technically, there are a lot of features and terminology you should know if you want to stay informed, but I can’t cover all that here, that’s why I made a separate article specifically for that purpose, called 
Best Gaming Mouse 2022 – Buyer’s Guide
.


Switches


The way that mouse buttons work is that they have these micro switches underneath them, where when pressed they interact with an element of the graphical user interface (GUI), causing that action to appear on the screen. That’s the most basic way I could explain it without getting too technical.


Currently, there are 2 types of micro switches in the market, mechanical and optical. The difference between them is that the optical switch uses light, as in infrared light to register the click making for a faster response time. While a mechanical switch uses, well, a mechanical connection.


Sensor


Another important factor while choosing a mouse is the sensor. With a sensor, you have DPI (dot-per-inch), which measures the sensitivity of a mouse, the higher the number the faster the device will move. Now in most cases, this is just a marketing gimmick as you will most likely never need the maximum DPI a mouse provides. Instead, you should look at what kind of sensor it has. 


Currently, there are two types in the market, a laser sensor and an optical one. The optical sensor uses infrared light to track the mouse and is generally more precise, but doesn’t work on transparent surfaces, these are the mice that have a small light emitting from the bottom. While the laser sensor uses, well, a laser to track the mouse, it’s considered less precise but works on glass. These are the mice that have no light emitting from the bottom.


Conclusion


I hope I helped you at least a little bit in finding a good mouse. Whether it is a Razer mouse, a Logitech mouse, or even a Corsair, these tips work for every gaming mouse. Again, I could not cover everything and even with the things I did, I couldn’t go into much detail. If you want to find out more, please check out the 
Best Gaming Mouse 2022 – Buyer’s Guide
. 


Final Verdict


For the best Razer mouse list, my personal favorite has to be either the Razer Naga Trinity or Razer Pro Click. Why not both? 


I love the Razer Naga Trinity for its customization and performance. The switchable side panels make it one of the most versatile mice out there. If you want a break from an MMO, simply change to the MOBA buttons, afterward if you want to play an FPS, just go with the dual thumb buttons. Not to mention that you can adjust the DPI when switching between games, of course, this is a given but it’s even more evident in this mouse. My brother also loved it and has been using it every day since I gifted it to him for his birthday, much to the dismay of his fiance. The Razer Naga Trinity is certainly the best Razer mouse in my book or at least one of the best.


As for the Razer Pro Click? I also love it for its versatility and the stable connection it provides, not to mention the great performance and multi-host connectivity really does help with work. Personally, I like having different mice for my work and gaming time, but the Pro Click can be used as both. 


But those are just my opinions, you might prefer the Razer DeathAdder V2 to the Trinity, whatever the case may be, we can all agree that Razer makes some of the best mice.

A: Despite what I previously said, about being a Razer fanboy. I don’t think you should buy a mouse based on the brand. I think you should look at each device individually, its strengths and weaknesses, and make your decision based on that, not on what company manufactures them.


Q: What’s the difference between an FPS mouse, an MMO mouse, and an office mouse?


A: The difference between an FPS mouse and an MMO mouse is mainly the number of buttons it has and the weight of the device. While the difference between a gaming mouse and an office mouse is in its features, performance, and low latency.


Q: If I want to get into gaming mice is Razer a good place to start?


A: Almost definitely. As a brand, Razer has some high-quality mice that range from really inexpensive to – it will cost you an arm and a leg. So depending on who you are and where you are from, there is something for everyone. 


Q: What’s the difference between a Razer mouse and a Logitech mouse?


A: As mentioned before you should look at a mouse individually, not as part of a brand. But as far as companies go, Razer is more focused on professional gaming mice, while Logitech sells a range of different mice for different purposes.


Q: I already own a couple of Razer peripherals, will I be able to sync them with my Razer mouse?


A: Yes, with the Synapse software.

Smartwatches for iPhone: Top 10 for 2023,https://10beasts.com/best-smartwatches-iphone/,"



Smartwatches aren’t just high-tech gadgets for folks in Silicon Valley anymore. Instead, more and more regular Joe’s are appreciating what smartwatches can bring to their daily lives and what they can do to improve their workout routines. Many of the best smartwatches can now track your calories, heart rate, sleep quality, and even your stress level! They’re health accessories more than anything else.


But they can also provide extra conveniences, especially for folks constantly on the go. Smartwatches can notify you about calls or texts, help you pay remotely without bringing out your wallet, and much more. All of this high-tech convenience seems to be a perfect combination for the Apple brand.


But despite this apparent match-made-in-heaven, lots of smartwatches seem to be tailored more for Android devices. I personally wondered why this was. Turns out, even though there are plenty of 
Android-focused smartwatches
, there are also lots of great smartwatches for iPhone users. The trick was finding them.


Being who I am, I wasn’t content to just find them on Amazon. I also wanted to try them out myself to see if they were just as good as the competition. As a bonus, now you (yes, you, iPhone user!) can see an awesome collection of top iPhone-compatible smartwatches you know will work with your Apple device.


Since the iPhone model plays a big role in what a smartwatch can be useful for, I tailored this review’s sections with a list of smartwatches compatible with iPhones identified by iPhone model or OS version. With all that said, let’s get started!

Any smartwatch worth pairing with your iPhone needs to be a great smart device in its own right. That’s why I chose the Apple Watch 6 as the best overall iPhone smartwatch; it’s great not only as a counterpart to an iOS device but also as a staple watch for any purpose you can imagine.


For starters, it features one of the best GPS signals of all iPhone-compatible smartwatches. As a result, the smartwatch can capably track your location, which works well in conjunction with many of its other excellent features, like the proprietary ECG app and other fitness-related apps that can help you maintain an active lifestyle and meet your fitness goals.


This functionality even extends to measuring your blood oxygen thanks to the sensor and app included with the smartwatch by default. I found this to be great for keeping track of my energy level when in high altitudes or when hiking in unfamiliar environments.


But perhaps most interesting is the “always-on” display. This is about 2.5 times brighter outdoors and whenever your wrist is down. In a nutshell, it’s just a unique way that the Apple Watch Series 6 maintains maximum visibility at all times. It’s a far cry from some cheaper smartwatches that can’t be relied on in bright sunlight.


To add to the watch’s value, it comes in five different colors, many of which are perfect for both men and women. Plus, each watch comes with an aluminum case and a black sport band. This guarantees pretty good weatherproofing and excellent durability, though the rubber band clearly marks the watch as a fitness tool rather than a businessperson’s top accessory. Additional straps for iPhones are easy to find though, and there are 
plenty of luxury options for any taste
.


Still, I found it ultimately to have everything you’d want in an iPhone smartwatch. Like most other top iPhone wrist watches, this device can take calls and texts, let you listen to music, and obviously works quite well with Apple Pay and Siri. It’s a lot like having a full-on smart tablet on your wrist without any downsides!


Well, 
almost
. I did find that the battery life of 18 hours is a little short compared to the multi-day batteries offered by smartwatches elsewhere on the market. But this ultimately minor downside doesn’t take away from the facts: this smartwatch is one of the best for iPhone users, bar none. 


 
 
Pros
 




 Made with a lightweight and durable aluminum case, and comes in multiple colors


 Bright display is about 2.5 times brighter than the competition


 Lots of apps and functions well designed for use with iPhones and other Apple devices


 Great Bluetooth connectivity and one of the best GPS smartwatches, even in spotty areas


 Some unique sensors, like those for measuring your blood oxygen




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 The battery life of 18 hours could be a little better, especially for the asking price

If you are looking for the best overall smartwatch for your iPhone, you need the 
Apple Watch Series 7
. This smartwatch comes in five colors, perfectly works with your cellular carrier, and offers maximum convenience and control over health tracking features. The only drawback is that it is expensive.


The Apple Watch Series 7 has quickly become one of the most popular apple watches, and with good reason. It allows you to stay connected with your friends and family, even when your phone is away. You can connect your Apple Watch to your cellular provider. This connection allows you to receive and respond to texts, phone calls, emails, and social media from your watch.


You can do other things with your Apple Watch as well. For example, you can stream music, listen to podcasts, and enjoy audiobooks on the go. The Apple Watch will connect to wireless earbuds so you can enjoy your music and entertainment no matter where you are. Furthermore, you can pay instantly using Apple Pay from your watch.


Like any good smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 7 tracks health vitals. It can measure your blood oxygen, take an ECG, track your heart rate, and follow your workouts. Use the Apple Watch with your iPhone fitness app to track your daily activities and see your trends over the long run (pun intended).


The design of the Apple Watch Series 7 is notable as well. It has a large face, making it easy to read and respond to your notifications. The model itself is also water-resistant at 50 meters. So, you can wear this watch whenever swimming in shallow waters. For further protection, the model is dust resistant.


Because there are five different colors to choose from, you get to customize the appearance based on your personal style. The only thing to remember is that the face is extra-large, which not all wearers enjoy. The more prominent face makes it a bit easier to crack the screen. So, be careful with the watch.


The number one drawback of the Apple Watch Series 7 is its expensive price tag. Even though all Apple watches are relatively expensive, this one is by far the most costly. It is about double the price of any other watch on my list. Not to mention, the price tag will go up once you connect it to your family’s cellular plan.


Despite the expensive price tag, the Apple Watch Series 7 is the number one watch to get if you have an iPhone. It comes with many features to ensure you have everything you need when on the go, even when you don’t have your cell phone in hand.


If you have to pick one smartwatch for your iPhone and budget is not a factor, get the Apple Watch Series 7. This Apple Watch comes with all of the features you need and want from an Apple Watch, allowing you to stay connected from everywhere without your phone.


 
 
Pros
 




 Tracks health and vitals


 Can connect to your cellular plan


 Receive and respond to phone notifications


 Waterproof

Here’s another more affordable iPhone smartwatch that I found in my search for the best. Unlike many other smartwatches on the market (including those for 
Android devices instead of iPhones
), this watch was clearly built with style in mind as opposed to raw functionality or a sportier aesthetic.


This slim smartwatch has a steel casing that comes in silver, slate gray, and rose gold colors depending on your preferences – each can be great for both fitness or business environments. It reminds me almost of Fossil smartwatches, which balance form and function super well in my eyes.


But looks isn’t all that the watch brings to the table. Indeed, I was pleased to find that it has one of the longest-lasting battery lives of up to 25 days on one charge. Or you can alternatively engage a power-reserve mode that only tracks your activity and the time and get another 20 days of battery life for over a month in total. This makes it one of the best vacation or long-distance travel iPhone smartwatches you can find.


When set to its regular mode, the watch can automatically track over 30 activities depending on your fitness goals. The watch, of course, comes with a connected GPS sensor that can provide a map of your location and your session. Heart rate monitoring is included by default, too, and you can rest assured about this function’s accuracy due to the long-lasting battery.


But I also really liked the simplified and minimalist interface that isn’t nearly as cluttered and digital-number-heavy as some of the more popular smartwatches on the market. Even though the watch seems simpler than other smartwatches, you’ll still benefit from additional features and functions like sleep tracking and a host of standard smartphone notifications like calls, texts, and other app notifications. Alexa Skill is included, too, to facilitate this kind of convenience.


All in all, it’s one of my favorites due to its elegance and function. There are a few gadgets that combine style and features as well as this.


 
 
Pros
 




 Comes with one of the most simplified but elegant aesthetics on the smartwatch market


 Lots of customization choices based on your personal aesthetics


 Has all the fitness and health-related features and apps you would expect, plus a few extras


 Amazon Alexa comes built-in


 Has arguably the longest battery life in the industry and can go over one month if you engage the power reserve mode




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 No Apple Pay functionality, and the notification screen for apps and calls is necessarily small due to the minimalist aesthetic. Some will appreciate this more than others

The Fitbit series of smartwatches is one of the most popular on the market. I found the Fitbit Versa 2: an affordable and versatile smartwatch that works equally well for iPhone devices as it does for Android smartphones and tablets.


It’s a good “one-stop-shop” for most major smartwatch features you would expect, including scanners for your heart rate, your sleep quality and restlessness, and all kinds of other exercises. In fact, the smartwatch comes with over 20 goal-based exercise modes you can engage at the touch of a button. It’s also water-resistant down the 50 m, so it’s fine for tracking your efforts and progress with swim-based exercises.


Of course, it also gets calls, texts, and plenty of smartphone app notifications so long as you connect the smartwatch to your iPhone via Bluetooth. This connectivity is a bit weaker than some other fitness-focused smartwatches I’ve seen, but it wasn’t too bad. Fitbit Pay is a unique application that syncs easily enough with most Apple devices, so this is a decent replacement for Apple Pay if you like to pay for stuff on the go with your smartwatch.


More important is the 90-day trial you get for Fitbit Premium upon purchasing the smartwatch. This makes it one of the best iPhone smartwatches for fitness enthusiasts all around. While the Premium subscription will need to be renewed manually after 90 days, lots of folks will find the additional insights and tracking apps that come with it to be well worth the handful of bucks it costs.


Other than that, it’s a solid all-around piece of equipment that’s offered in six different colors so it can match multiple personalities and aesthetics without straying from its core style. The band is unfortunately not changeable, but it’s flexible and soft on the wrist and shouldn’t cause any undue discomfort. You do, however, get two versions of the same band when you make the purchase: a small band and a large band. Both men and women can enjoy this smartwatch as a result.


 
 
Pros
 




 Offers over 20 exercise modes to help you track your fitness goals and progress


 Also includes a 90-day trial for Fitbit Premium


 Features a pretty large display that has lots of room for notifications and other digital alerts


 Comes in multiple different colors and offers two sizes of bands when you make a purchase


 Offers special Fitbit Pay feature to let you make digital payments




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Bluetooth range seems to be a little shorter compared to some other smartwatches, maybe around 20m instead of 30m

There are plenty of good smartwatches for you to afford and hook up to your iPhone. Even if you are on a budget. My favorite best value smartwatch for the iPhone is the 
Amazift Band 5
. This model is highly affordable, yet it allows you to track your vitals and stay connected.


Most notably, the Amazift Band 5 is only a fraction of the price of the Apple smartwatch. In fact, it is under $50, making it suitable for those even on the most limited of budgets. Given that it is an Amazon product, it also lasts and works as it claims.


Despite being affordable, it has many functionalities and features to help monitor your health. It has a blood oxygen saturation monitor, a 24/7 heart rate tracker, sleep tracker, step counter, and women’s health tracker. It also has 11 built-in sports modes so that you can accurately monitor your exercise.


In addition to the numerous health monitoring features, the Amazift Band 5 is convenient and long-lasting. It comes with an Amazon Alexa built-in to quickly set alarms, check the weather, or control your watch with just your voice. Furthermore, the watch has a 15-day battery life, so you don’t have to worry about charging your watch.


Something I truly love about this product is its slim design. Although the Apple Watch is convenient if you want to check and respond to emails and texts, a face like that can get bulky, especially during workouts. The Amazift Band 5 has a slim design so that it is constantly out of your way and does not hinder your activities.


Users report that the Amazift Band 5 offers exactly what it claims. It is comparable to the Fitbit, but it is way more affordable, but it works the exact same. Many users claim it works fantastically with Alexa and connects seamlessly with any iPhone.


What about iPhone connectivity? Because this is not an iPhone product, you might worry that it doesn’t connect properly. You don’t have to worry about that. This product connects quickly and perfectly with your iPhone, despite being a non-Apple product.


The only downside is that it doesn’t always have the most reliable tracking data. Many users report that the sleeping function, for example, is not very accurate. Still, they find it is accurate in other sectors. Most of the other complaints are very minor.


Even though the Amazift Band 5 is way more affordable than the Apple Watch, it is still a great purchase if you want an affordable smartwatch to connect to your iPhone. It merges seamlessly with iPhones and allows you to track and stay connected without breaking your budget.


If you are looking for a smartwatch to connect to your iPhone on a budget, you need the Amazift Band 5. Although it isn’t perfect, it offers plenty of features and capabilities to stay healthy and notified, even when your iPhone isn’t around.

The Apple Watch brand returns once again, and it’s no surprise since these watches are designed from the ground up to be compatible with most iPhone devices. But this older version of the Apple Watch line is on the list since it’s much cheaper than the Series 6, but provides some of the same benefits as its more recent and advanced counterpart.


For instance, it retains the bright retina display that allows you to see all the watch’s information even during bright daylight. In addition to this design, you’ll benefit from a sharp GPS tracker that works even in more remote areas, a swim-proof design, and automatic iTunes and Apple Pay compatibility so you can pay for things on the go, store music and audiobooks, and play your favorite media as you work out. Having the App Store on your wrist is certainly a nice bonus.


It’s ultimately one of the faster smartwatches on the market, as I discovered when I tinkered with it a bit. This is due to the dual-core processor embedded inside the smartwatch. This is what allows it to perform multiple functions simultaneously without stuttering or lagging.


Other nice features I found include an optical heart sensor and an emergency SOS beacon. That last function isn’t noted or easy to find on plenty of other smartwatches, but here it marks the Apple Watch 3 as a good smartwatch for explorers or off-the-trail hikers who have iPhones.


Unfortunately, this being the direct predecessor to the Apple Watch 6 means that it inherits many of the same disadvantages. For instance, battery life caps out at about 18 hours. Furthermore, the watch is stuck in an older Apple aesthetic, with a particularly thick band and only two available colors.


Still, I’d recommend this if you want an Apple Watch of one kind or another but don’t want to go too far back down the line’s history due to compatibility issues. It also doesn’t hurt that this is cheaper than the more recent iteration for the line.


 
 
Pros
 




 Very easy to link up with any Apple device


 Much more affordable than newer Apple Watches


 Allows you to store Apple media and browse the App Store on your wrist, plus take advantage of unique Apple features like Apple Pay


 Has an emergency SOS beacon, good GPS functionality, and other fitness-related apps


 Includes a very bright retina display so it’s easy to use even in broad daylight




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Battery life is still a little lower than what you can get these days at just 18 hours on a charge


 The aesthetic of the semi-thick rubber band won’t be appealing to a lot of modern fitness enthusiasts

If you consider yourself an outdoorsman, you might be looking for a smartwatch with all the features to keep yourself as safe and healthy as possible. In that case, I recommend that you get the 
Apple Watch SE
. This watch will help you out whether you are in the city or out in the wild.


Like the other Apple Watch, you can connect the Apple Watch SE to your phone via Bluetooth and cellular connection. You will have to go to your cellular provider if you want the watch connected to your phone.


Once your watch is up and running, the Apple Watch SE is the perfect companion for your outdoor adventures. It has a built-in compass with real-time elevation readings to understand where you are going and what you are doing. It also has an emergency SOS feature so that you can call for help in the case of an emergency.


If you fall and cannot hit the emergency SOS, the Apple Watch can detect if you have fallen and call emergency services for you. This feature is critical for keeping you safe whenever hiking and adventuring outside.


You don’t have to worry about the Apple Watch breaking on your travels. It is made from 100% recycled aluminum, which is lightweight and durable. The model comes with a water resistance rating of 50 meters and dust resistance. You don’t have to worry about your watch getting damaged if it is raining or you cool off in a pond.


Even when you are not adventuring outdoors, the Apple Watch SE is still helpful. It allows you to receive and respond to text messages and phone calls from your wrist. It can even allow you to sync music and download podcasts and audiobooks to stay entertained.


When exercising in the city, you can monitor that as well. The smartwatch tracks your daily activity using the phone’s fitness app. You can even add your favorite workouts, such as swimming, yoga, tai chi, and pilates. Monitor your health by watching your vitals and heart rate throughout all of this.


Surprisingly, the Apple Watch SE is nowhere near as expensive as my Series 7 top pick. In fact, it is nearly half the price of the Apple Watch Series 7. This makes the Apple Watch SE better suited for individuals not willing to spend that much money. Although this watch is undoubtedly more expensive than my budget pick, it is not outrageously priced.


Like the Apple Watch Series 7, there are practically no drawbacks to this model. It is reliable and connects seamlessly to your Apple Watch. However, you must have other safety gear with you if you are hiking. This watch alone is not enough to keep you safe. Keep that in mind when on your travels.


Even though the Apple Watch SE should not be used alone in order to keep you safe while adventuring, it is a great tool to monitor your health, vitals, and tracking when out and about. Whether you are in the great wide open or in the city, this smartwatch can help you do it all.


Get the Apple Watch SE smartwatch if you want an apple product that can go with you on adventures in the wild or in the city. It can help you stay safe when hiking, but it is still more affordable than the Series 7. Just make sure to pack other safety gear when adventuring with this watch.

For whatever reason, you might be looking for a non-Apple smartwatch that works perfectly with your iPhone. Luckily for you, there are quite a few options to consider. However, one of my favorites is the 
Fossil Gen 5 smartwatch
. This watch is not the Apple brand, but it is perfect for IOS operating systems and looks excellent.


The Fossil Gen 5 is designed for many phones. It can work with iPhones and Androids, perfect for practically all phone users. Although you might have an iPhone now, you can still use this watch if you decide to switch to an Android later. That’s a significant plus of this product! You can buy new 22mm Fossil bands, and they will fit the watch perfectly.


No matter what phone you are connecting the watch to, you will need to download Google Fit. Google Fit is a free app that will connect to this smartwatch. Once Google Fit is up and running, the Fossil Gen 5 will flow seamlessly with your iPhone.


Google Fit is designed to track a number of health and fitness ratings. It can track your heart rate, activity, and even distance. It even has a water-resistant design for shallow waters. These functions ensure you stay healthy and fit while using the Fossil Gen 5.


This smartwatch is great for your lifestyle as well. You can customize the screen with thousands of watch faces. Furthermore, the watch comes in three fashionable styles so that you get a smartwatch that is perfect for your style and fashion sense.


You can also integrate hundreds of apps into the watch for notifications. You can use social media, payments, music, games, and even assistance apps, all with the watch. That does not include the cellular connectivity of the Fossil Gen 5. With the Bluetooth connection, you will get notified about calendar notifications, texts, and phone calls in real-time. You can even answer your calls through the watch.


The price of this watch is closest to the Apple Watch SE. This makes the watch slightly expensive, but it isn’t outrageous. It is about half the price of the Apple Watch Series 7, my top pick.


The only drawback about this model is that it doesn’t have the longest battery life. You should charge this watch every night to ensure that it is charged and ready for the day. Aside from this drawback, the Fossil Gen 5 is an excellent non-Apple smartwatch for your iPhone.


Although the Fossil Gen 5 is not an Apple product, it seamlessly integrates with iPhones using the Google Fit app. Just download the app, and you will be able to enjoy this customizable, fashionable, and practical smartwatch provided by Fossil on practically all phones.


If you do not want an Apple smartwatch, I recommend going with the Fossil Gen 5 instead. It seamlessly integrates with your iPhone and offers all the same features and capabilities as your iPhone. All the while, it is about half the price of the Apple Watch Series 7.


 
 
Pros
 




 Not Apple


 Connects to iPhone with Google Fit


 Can use the watch on Android


 Health tracker


 Integrate with numerous apps


 More affordable than the Series 7




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Short battery life

This Garmin Vivoactive 4 smartwatch is one of the more interesting and innovative models I found. That’s because, unlike most other smartwatches, it displays animated workouts right on the watch face. 


It sounds like a gimmick, but to my own surprise, I found the workout animations to be a little instructive and even helpful when trying out a new workout or movement for the first time. The displayable workouts include strength training, yoga, Pilates, and even some cardio workouts.


But that’s not all. The watch allows you to easily download songs from Amazon Music, Spotify, and other providers. This makes the watch a great pick for iPhone users that may be used to being limited to iTunes or Apple Store-only songs. In addition to all of this musical functionality, the watch comes with over 20 preloaded indoor sports and GPS apps to help you track your fitness efforts and results over time.


It can do all this thanks to the eight-day battery life, even when in the main smartwatch mode with most of its features and apps enabled. However, keep in mind that the watch unfortunately drops to a six-hour battery life if you use music or GPS tracking. This precipitous decrease in power is the only big downside I noticed with my time with this watch.


On the brighter side, you can easily personalize the watch thanks to the selection of thousands of watch faces, widgets, and apps. All of these can be accessed from the proprietary IQ store (the button for which is located on the home screen). Other unique features, like safety and tracking apps and “incident detection” mark this watch is one of the most inventive, even if it isn’t outright the best or the most powerful.


For instance, the incident detection feature can figure out when you’ve had a fall or when something has gone wrong during an exercise, especially when the watch is paired to your iPhone. In the event of an emergency, the watch can automatically send your real-time location to pre-listed emergency contacts.


All in all, fitness enthusiasts or regular folks who want an all-in-one smartwatch will find a lot to like here. In a way, it 
not
 being designed exclusively for iPhone or Android devices means that the developers could spend more time coming up with interesting additions, like the incident detection app.


 
 
Pros
 




 Has a good, minimalist aesthetic and a comfortable wristband, plus a durable watch face that is waterproof


 Includes tons of unique features and safety settings, like an incident detection feature and some additional fitness inclusions


 Works well with most iPhone apps and assistants


 Uses animated workouts on the watch face, which is a unique development not seen anywhere else


 Allows you to easily download and listen to songs from most major playlists and music platforms




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 While it has good battery life overall, engaging the GPS or music features will automatically drop the battery life down to less than a day, which is a big downside

For my last pick, I wanted something cheap and affordable for folks who want an iPhone compatible smartwatch on a tight budget. The answer? The Amazfit Bip. This super-affordable and simple smartwatch nonetheless has a lot of things that may just make it worth your while.


For starters, it easily has one of the longest battery lives in the industry, clocking in at a whopping 45 days. The lithium-polymer battery inside the smartwatch will keep running and running and running even after heavy use, putting much more expensive and recent smartwatches to shame. Granted, this is partially because the watch doesn’t have as many features or advanced functions as some of the more modern smartwatches on the market.


Still, I like this. It only weighs 32 g, so it’s a light fit on your wrist, and it includes a lot of standard fitness-focused features like heart rate monitoring and a built-in GPS feature. It’s great for tracking the calories you burn and the quality of your sleep, and it even includes sport-specific apps for measuring your progress for things like cycling, walking, and running. It’s a little more basic than some other more sophisticated watches, but that’s what you get for a really affordable price.


The watch is also a good pick for all the reminders and notifications it can provide. Notifications for SMS messages, emails, and phone calls are accurate and consistent, and you can even set the watch to remind you about sitting for too long or for various other alarms. The downside is that this is one of the few smartwatches that doesn’t include a speaker so you can 
make
 phone calls. Again, it’s easy to see the limitations that the low price imposes.


But not everyone wants to bother with potentially spotty smartwatch phone calls anyway. In that case, the Bip provides just the raw essentials that you might want in an iPhone smartwatch: fitness tracking, GPS tracking, and connectivity with your iPhone device so you can use your apps and Apple Pay on the go.


Keep in mind too that the Bip isn’t customizable or all that aesthetically impressive. It’s a really simple watch for simple needs. In my mind, you won’t be disappointed if you go into this purchase with the right mindset and aren’t expecting the world from such a cheap, basic smartwatch.


 
 
Pros
 




 Can be purchased for a super affordable asking price


 Comes with a really long battery life of up to 45 days depending on the features you use


 Made with a durable band and watch face


 Includes most “critical” smartwatch features, like fitness tracking and integration with your iPhone for up to 20-30m, plus notifications for calls and texts




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Doesn’t include plenty of more advanced features, like the ability to make phone calls or including a speaker


 Some of the included fitness apps are pretty limited – for instance, more niche sports like tennis or swimming aren’t included with the tracking functions and must be tracked using the general software instead


 This watch isn’t very customizable and only comes in a single, bland black color




 
 
 


Methodology


Finding the best watches for iPhone users didn’t involve me buying them all! For which I’m very grateful, by the way – it’s easy to bankrupt yourself if you try to buy all the new gadgets just for testing’s sake. Plus, could you imagine having dozens of different smartwatches in your closet, only to use one or two at 
all
?


Instead, I asked around both the staff here and folks at actual electronic shops that I know. Word of advice? If you want to write for tech sites like me, get to know people in the industry. They’ll be more than happy to give you their unbiased opinions about different tech devices and gadgets, especially if they had a really good or really bad experience with any of them.


Anyway, I used a combination of both first-hand experience and secondhand experience from people I knew to develop the opinions and insights you see above. That’s why you’ll see plenty of scattered subjective information in addition to raw facts about what functions or apps each smartphone offers regardless of personal enjoyment.


Even with all the ones I checked out, I still left plenty of great choices. For instance, there are tons of good Fossil iPhone smartwatches. But I ultimately picked the final list based on ones I had tried personally or received personal information from.


I wrote this review after collecting all the information and forming a solid opinion on each watch. In the end, remember that all of the above 10 watches are good choices, even if I (and you) prefer some of them to others.


Buyer’s Guide


Reading my opinions (and the shortened opinions of different coworkers or industry insiders) is one thing. It’s quite another to actually buy an iPhone compatible smartwatch for yourself. To that end, here’s a buying guide – read through it so you know exactly what to think about when purchasing any smartwatch.


Why Not Just Use an Apple Watch?


This is the million-dollar question: if you have an iPhone or any kind of iOS device you want to pair with a smartwatch, why not just buy an Apple Watch? After all, that line of smartwatches has been designed from the ground up to work with recent iOS devices, and sometimes they even include special features that you don’t get from combining mismatched phone and watch brands.


There’s no denying that Apple Watches are among the best iPhone smartwatches for exactly these reasons. But at the same time, there are reasons you might consider going with a smartwatch from another manufacturer. For instance:




Some smartwatches also come with unique features or applications that you can’t get from the Apple Watch line. The exclusivity that the Apple brand uses is ultimately a double-edged sword that Apple enthusiasts know too well. You’re limited, in some ways, from certain applications or improvements for brand loyalty


Furthermore, some people aren’t sure that they’re going to stick with an iPhone over the long-term, especially given the recent power cable stuff that Apple has been forcing on its customers. If you get a smartwatch that isn’t limited to syncing with iPhone devices, you can feel free to pick up whatever new smartphone you want and rest assured that it’ll likely pair easily enough with your favorite smartwatch


Lastly, some people just don’t like the look of Apple Watches. This is purely a subjective preference, but even I see what they mean – I tend to prefer smartwatches that are more professional and stylish, and maybe even a little streamlined in terms of their aesthetic. Some Apple products still retain the toylike, blocky quality that they can’t really get away from without reinventing the brand




All in all, Apple watches are great choices but they’re not the only ones available to you. Most smartwatches on the market can pair with iPhones of at least a certain OS update or later. This is why I include both Apple Watches and alternatives to Apple watches in my list above.


Apple Watch Alternatives


To help you visualize this a little more easily, I’ll break down all the Apple Watch alternatives I listed above in different categories.


Similar to Apple Watches


What makes a smartwatch similar to an Apple Watch? In my eyes, Apple watch alternatives that are similar to that line will have pretty similar aesthetics or preference for iOS devices.




Fitbit Versa 2


Amazfit Bip


Fitbit Ionic




Note that these smartwatches that are similar to Apple Watches all have minimalized aesthetics and a focus on fitness apps and rubber wristbands. Meanwhile, they’re really easy to sync to Apple devices.


Different from Apple Watches


By the same token, more distinct Apple Watch alternatives will have unique aesthetics that stray from the Apple brand. Furthermore, they may even have a preference for Android devices but still link up well enough with Apple phones and tablets.




TicWatch E2


Samsung Galaxy Watch 3


Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2


Garmin Vivoactive 4


Withings Steel HR




In contrast, these Apple Watch alternatives feature more professional or other aesthetics. Some of them, like the Samsung watches, are also designed for Android users more than iOS users.


Either way, any of these watches can be a good fit for your iPhone if your device is of the appropriate OS version. Remember to check the appropriate update number as I described above so you don’t buy a watch that is incompatible with your iPhone’s operating system version.


iOS/Phone Compatibility






Speaking of OS version, that is one of the big things you should focus on when purchasing a new watch for your iPhone. Any OS version or 
later
 means that iPhones that have been properly updated beyond the listed OS number should sync quickly and easily to a given watch.


But you’ll also need to note whether or not a watch has a phone limit. For instance, the Apple Watch 6 requires that you have an iPhone 6S or later. This is due to the hardware requirements that the Apple Watch 6 demands for linking with your phone and to ensure that the watch doesn’t cause both devices to slow down when it sends data back and forth.


iPhones can only update so much and a phone’s physical components limit the amount of processing power and storage space that the device offers. If a watch doesn’t list a specific iPhone model or generation, remember this: the best rule of thumb is to get a smartwatch compatible for iPhone 6 or higher. This will ensure maximum theoretical compatibility. You may need to do some more investigating if you’re on the border (say, you have an iPhone 5).


For my part, I used an iPhone 6S since that was what I had already.


How’s the Connectivity/GPS Range?






One other big thing to check when determining the best iPhone smartwatch for your needs is the watch’s connectivity strength and GPS range. Connectivity strength refers to how reliable the Bluetooth connection is, especially if you move from room to room or step significantly away from the phone.


Most smartwatches these days have Bluetooth connectivity ranges of between 20 m and 30 m. However, most will also lose their connection if you move a wall between you and your connected device. This interrupts the Bluetooth signal.


All of the watches above have decent connectivity ranges. GPS range works pretty similarly but describes how accurate the GPS signal is. Some smartwatches’ GPS systems only work well if you stay within city limits, as that’s where satellite coverage is most common for Internet coverage and other communication purposes. But others can still work even if you head out into rural territory or the mountains for a hike. Naturally, the latter types of watches are better for outdoor fitness fanatics.


Is the Watch Weatherproof?


Weatherproofing involves sealing the smartwatch’s delicate internal components and electrical parts against water, wind, and fog. Weatherproof smartwatches are an absolute necessity if you plan to use the watch for outdoor exercise, especially since you can’t discount the possibility of sweat getting into and onto the watch.


Furthermore, you’ll need a durable and waterproof watch if you want to take it with you during your swimming exercises for the purposes of tracking calories burned or measuring your heart rate. The good news is that practically all smartwatches these days are weatherproof to one degree or another. The industry standard is waterproofing down the 50 m of depth, which is what all the smartwatches above post, even the Amazfit Bip.


In a way, this isn’t something you really have to worry about – just double check that the watch you are eyeing isn’t one of the rare exceptions to the rule.


How Can You Customize It?


Some of the 
best smartwatches
 for iPhones and other devices will allow you to customize their watch faces or displays. This isn’t strictly necessary for raw effectiveness or for fitness boosting, but it’s a nice bit of added value that can help to distinguish your watch from others at your gym or in your social group.


Plus, some people just like to customize their gadgets. There’s a reason we change all of our home screens on our phones and spend lots of time picking out different profile pictures for social media accounts. The same impulse holds true for iPhone compatible smartwatch customization.


Additionally, check to see whether the smartwatch in question has multiple exterior colors or materials. Some smartwatches, like the Amazfit Bip, only come with a single design and color, which limits the outfits or other 
iPhone accessories
 you can use with the watch without things looking weird. 


Phone Call Quality/Functionality






The majority of smartwatches will also come with the ability to place and receive phone calls, or at the bare minimum to receive alerts that your iPhone is getting a call wherever you left it. This is something to check out, as there are a few smartwatches that don’t include speakers that would otherwise allow you to make your phone call without having to reach your phone physically.


You’ll also want to note the speaker quality if you have a smartwatch that can make calls, of course, to see if the feature is really worth your time.


Other Features


Lastly, be sure to check out what other features a smartphone might include. Special apps, connectivity add-ons, or even special smartwatch assistants can swing the decision toward one smartwatch or another if you are stuck between two great picks.


Final Verdict


At the end of the day, I really liked the Withings Steel HR and ended up buying it for myself. I know, 
I know
, now I have two smartwatches! But now I figure I’m all set if one of them goes caput.


The big thing is that the Steel HR is ultimately much more affordable than some of the more high-tech Apple Watch offerings, but it still offers the aesthetic and style that I tend to prioritize in my gadget picks. I fell in love with the sleek watch face, minimalist design, and long battery life. In my opinion, it’s the best smartwatch for iPhones overall, even though it’s not an Apple product and it doesn’t work with Apple Pay.


But who knows? Your choice might very well be different from mine!


FAQs


Q: Are all smartwatches compatible with iPhones?


A: No, but most are. Manufacturers include this so that their watches can reach as many people as possible. While most smartwatches can work with some iPhones, they also usually have limitations on the operating system version or iPhone physical model.


Q: Is it worthwhile to get a non-Apple smartwatch for use with an iPhone?


A: It can be. It depends on what you prioritize! Non-Apple smartwatches can come with certain additional fitness apps, features, or even aesthetic choices you might find more attractive than those that are only offered within Apple’s product collections.


Q: What happens if you use a smartwatch with an iPhone that doesn’t have the appropriate iOS version?


A: The watch will likely not be able to connect via Bluetooth correctly, if at all. 


Q: Does Wear OS work with iPhones?


A: Yes, but only with iPhones within an OS version updated to 9.3 or later.


Q: What are the main differences between smart watches for men and women?


A: In general, smartwatches for women and men are identical with the exception of two aspects: size and aesthetics. Smartwatches for men will usually be a bigger size to account for men’s larger wrists, while the reverse is true for women. Some iPhone smartwatches for women may have brighter or more traditionally feminine colors like pink or red.


On the other hand, there are a few smartwatches that include women-focused fitness apps, like those that track hormonal cycles.

How to Extend WiFi Range and Get Rid of Dead Zones + The Top Reviewed Extenders,https://10beasts.com/how-to-extend-wifi-range/,"



These days, almost every person I know complains about poor WiFi connection. Whether it’s your own apartment, your hotel room, or a public space such as an office or a mall, there are blind spots and dead zones almost everywhere. 


Often, it’s the technical incompetence on the part of your service provider that causes this problem. In other cases, there may be some issues in your device that you need to address. 


Here, we’ll walk you through the possible reasons you may want to extend WiFi range. You’ll learn about the different types of WiFi range extenders, and discover the best WiFi range extender you can get to cover those dead zones. 


From some common, no-fail fixes to a range of WiFi boosters, here’s everything to teach you how to extend WiFi range at home!

How Do WiFi Range Extenders Work?


Simply put, a WiFi range extender catches signals from your WiFi router and amplifies, multiplies, and extends those signals further ahead of the existing coverage area. 


However, the exact manner in which your WiFi extender works depends on the type of booster, repeater, or extender you use. 


So, to figure out how to extend the range of your home WiFi network, you first have to pick the type of WiFi signal booster that’s appropriate for your router.


For Dead Zones With Ethernet: Wireless Access Point


You may install a wireless access point when you have an Ethernet cable connection at your house. This type of wireless connection repeater is integrated as a hardwired system and works only in connection with Ethernet access.


For Dead Zones in a WiFi Router: Powerline Adapter or Wireless Repeater


If you do not use Ethernet for Internet connection, you need to understand how to extend WiFi range using a powerline adapter. A powerline adapter is attached to the main electrical supply wires of your house. This adapter fills the role of an Ethernet cable and allows you to use a WiFi access point. 


However, if you want to figure out how to extend WiFi router range, it’s pretty simple. You can get a wireless repeater, and integrate it into your existing router arrangement. This will act as a second or third router, depending on the number of repeaters you use for a certain area.


For Poor or Large Infrastructure: WiFi Mesh Network


Sometimes, the way your house is built also has a role in degrading the WiFi quality in your house. So while you’re trying to figure out how to extend Verizon FiOS WiFi range, you should also figure out if your infrastructure is problematic. 


With tough building material and large spaces, you may find that a WiFi mesh network is an ideal solution for extending and improving WiFi service in your house.

The TP-Link RE505X extender comes with two powerful antennas to further the coverage area of your WiFi. While this blankets all those dead zones in your house, the RE505X extender also covers those parts where your router’s coverage doesn’t reach. 


The RE505X comes as a dual-band device, with a speed of 300 Mbps at 2.4 GHz and a speed of 1200 Mbps at 5 GHz. The extender is also fairly easy to use. It requires you to install the TP-Link application on your iOS or Android device. 


The TP-Link R505X can also be turned into a OneMesh router system for larger infrastructures. You can get a standard TP-Link router for this purpose and get even stronger connections at even the farthest and trickiest corners of your house.


 
 
Pros
 




 Allows multiple devices to stream, upload, and download high-quality multimedia simultaneously


 Easy to set up and operate from a single app

This TP-Link RE220 WiFi range extender delivers some of the most powerful results with its low-end price tag. Unlike many other options, you can get a decent boosted coverage at a space of 1200 sq. ft., which may be ideal for those who live in smaller homes that have structural anomalies. 


The AC750 WiFi extender runs on two frequencies: a 2.4 GHz at 300 Mbps and a 5 GHz at 433 Mbps. The RE220 Extender can also be connected with Ethernet cables. This way, this compatibility with routers and Ethernet services makes this product even more economically viable. 


You can use the TP-Link RE220 using Web UI controls as well as the Tether app. This way, the extender allows you to manage operational settings from any device, anywhere, and at any time. 


All things considered, this RE220 Extender from TP-Link is a pretty stellar investment for those who suffer from poor Internet services but can’t spare much for a full-fledged service upgrade!


 
 
Pros
 




 High-quality product and service at the lower end of the spectrum


 Sleek design that’s adjustable anywhere

While getting access and eliminating dead zones in your WiFi coverage is a big achievement, replacing them with high-speed coverage sounds even more exciting. Luckily, the D-Link DAP-X1870 makes that possible and easily doable for you. 


With its WiFi 6 range extension technology, the D-Link extender can offer up to 38% faster speeds at 5G Hz and up to 90% faster at 2.4 GHz. This means exceptionally fast streaming from multiple devices at multiple places – with minimal buffering!


The D-Link DAP-X1870 has a pretty easy setup and usage, too. You can control the settings and observe performance with a single tap using the D-Link mobile app for Android and iOS. 


Not only this, but the extender also incorporates a variety of cutting-edge technologies to improve your router experience, such as OFDMA, BSS coloring, as well as battery-saving options for your devices. 


 
 
Pros
 




 Reduces networking congestion in your Internet service


 Can connect to any access point, router, or ISP gateway around the house as well as outdoors


 Improved speeds save on your screen time and the device’s energy consumption

As far as I’ve observed, NETGEAR services can also be pretty promising when it comes to extending your WiFi range or improving router signals. If you’re a Verizon FiOS user and want your WiFi signals to expand over a larger territory, the NETGEAR EX7300 Extender can be a pretty wholesome investment. 


Another impressive point which many of you would love is that this mesh extender can connect with as many as forty devices! Pair up this feature with NETGEAR’s smart roaming technology, and you get a handful of amazing access points all over the house. 


However, you can experience some speed loss if there’s too many devices connected. In that case, you may want to consider learning how to extend WiFi range with another router.


So, the next time it’s the holiday season and your house is swarming with guests, you won’t have to keep struggling for WiFi access!


 
 
Pros
 




 Smart and effortless roaming in the entire coverage area


 Mesh networking makes it easier to stream and browse from any access point




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 You may face some speed loss and buffering issues when the network is crowded

Moreover, it’s also easy to set up, use, and switch between modes, which is ideal for those who aren’t exactly tech-savvy. The 867 Mbps speed operates at 5 GHz, while the 400 Mbps speed works at 2.4 GHz, which gives you a decent and seamless connectivity all over the house.

A single Google Nest covers up to 2,200 sq. ft. You can simply add more Nest to the junction if you want to multiply the coverage area.

FAQ Section


If you’re still a bit confused on how to extend WiFi range, here are some commonly asked questions about the devices.


What’s the Difference Between a WiFi Booster/Extender/Repeater?


The tech world comes up with new and creative terminology every day. This is why many people feel baffled about the exact difference between a WiFi booster, extender, and repeater. 


Since the technical lines of difference among these are blurred, it’s better to understand these differences from a literal, logical perspective. 


A booster is a device that works to speed up the signals it receives from the router.
An extender is a device that extends the coverage area or the spread of the router’s original signals.
A repeater is a device that absorbs the signals, then replicates them to reinforce signal strength.


Do WiFi Extenders Really Work?


WiFi extenders do work
 when there’s a genuine need for extension in coverage capacity or speed limit. However, you have to properly understand the function of a standard extender to figure out whether you need one or whether there’s something wrong with your current extender. 


A WiFi extender is supposed to lend a helping hand to your actual Internet router or cable line, for example, when you want to see how to extend WiFi range outdoors. That means that your Internet service is functioning well, but you still need a stronger performance, and this is where an extender comes in. 


However, if your device itself has issues with connection, speed, etc., even the best extenders won’t be of much use. In other words, extenders simply enhance what’s already there, but they cannot create faster Internet access on their own.


Do WiFi Extenders Slow Down My Internet Speed?


The primary function of WiFi extenders is to increase the speed and strength of your router, not to slow them down. 


When figuring out how to extend WiFi range without losing speed, this misconception demands proper clarification. Basically, the job of an extender is to make enhancements to the speed that’s already there. 


However, fluctuations in the router’s own performance put more burden on the extender since it has to make up for the lack of strong signals and proper speed. This is why the extender may deliver a subpar performance in some cases, giving the impression that it’s actually slowing down your WiFi.


What Are Some Common WiFi Signal Issues?


There’s a list of instances where my WiFi signals are so weak it almost drives me mad. However, these are actually pretty common, so here’s a brief breakdown of the causes and solutions for WiFi signal issues.


Low Speed 


Cause: Overcrowding, service outage, and voltage fluctuation
Solution: Restarting the WiFi system, professional tech support, and electrical checkups


Bandwidth Problems


Cause: Increased number of connected devices and peak hour data consumption
Solution: Disconnects devices that aren’t using the WiFi service


Hardware Problems


Cause: Poor hardware placement, outdated parts, and old software versions.
Solution: Try relocating your router and extender elsewhere, and ask your ISP for a hardware and software upgrade.


How to Fix WiFi Dead Zones?


Although WiFi extenders are known to erase dead zones quite swiftly, there are some other measures that you can adopt to reinforce WiFi in weaker coverage spots, such as the following:


Shift your router to an open space where it can direct beams efficiently.
Place boosters near areas that have a tricky architecture or tough-grade building material.
Use Ethernet or hardwired cables to get access points in places where wireless performance isn’t up to the mark.


Will a WiFi Booster Work with an Xbox, PS4, or Other Gaming Systems?


Yes, WiFi boosters can work with an Xbox, PlayStation 4, and similar gaming consoles. However, you may need a pretty powerful booster to make sure that your gaming doesn’t take up much of the data transfer, leaving other devices in those dreadful dead zones. In this case, you’d have to look for a 
PS4 booster
 that ensures powerful coverage to such high-demand systems. In other cases, you can also get a separate booster to work for only your gaming system.

FPS Gaming Mouse: Top 10 Reviewed and Rated Mice for 2022,https://10beasts.com/best-fps-mouse/,"



When it comes to PC gaming, there is a lot of equipment you need, and depending on the type of game you are playing, said equipment could vary. Still, no matter what your game of choice is, there is one piece of hardware you just can’t do without, and that is, of course, a mouse. But not just any mouse – you need a good mouse. Especially for FPS games, you can’t just settle with average; oh no no, you need the best fps mouse there is, and I am here to provide.


I know what you need and I have compiled a list of everything, from the best budget fps mouse to the best gaming mouse for big hands and even some unexpected entries.

gaming mouse
 comes in, and more specifically, the fps mouse. 


Trust me, as a person who spent most of his early gaming career playing with a cheap office mouse, switching to one that is specifically made for games has elevated my rank from silver to diamond. Well, there is also the possibility that I have improved since then, but that doesn’t change the fact that playing with a gaming mouse is on a whole ‘nother level of enjoyment and fun. As much as we hate to admit it, good hardware really does elevate your skills, not just in gaming but in most fields.


Since hardware is so important, I have decided to compile this list of the best fps gaming mice and maybe finally answer the all-important question: Which is the best fps mouse of all time? I am sure that this question will have no simple answer, but at the end, I am planning on telling you which is my personal favorite from this list. From big to small, light to heavy, I have tried to compile a diverse list of the best of the best so there would be something for everyone.

Standing there at the top of the tower with the Razer family is the Logitech G Pro Wireless, this wireless fps mouse is competing with the Razer Viper Ultimate for the throne in the wireless mouse kingdom. At least, in my head they are. Anyway, the Logitech G Pro Wireless is a force to be reckoned with.


According to Logitech itself, this mouse was built over a 2 year period, with collaboration from over 50 of E-Sports’s top players. Honestly I am inclined to believe them. The design is smooth and minimalistic, not to mention lightweight. No extra curves, no extra bellies – nothing feels out of place. This FPS mouse is what the Benq Zowie ec2-A was trying to accomplish. The mouse’s slick design is suitable for all types of hands and grips.


The Logitech G Pro Wireless has over 16 million color combinations that you could use to light up the device and represent your team, but there is more to it. Their new Lightsync technology allows the mouse colors to respond to in-game action and audio, for a more in-depth experience.


Now it’s easy to assume that when building such a design, one must sacrifice durability to achieve both comfort and a lightweight feel. Normally this is true, but that is not the case with the Logitech G Pro Wireless.


This FPS mouse was built to withstand hours and hours of professional E-Sports gaming, as well as training. It has 7 buttons in total, each of which uses a metal spring for tension suspension, which reduces travel distance and refines the actuation force. As a result, each click will feel accurate and tight. Not to mention that the four side buttons are removable on both sides, so it doesn’t matter if you are left-handed or right, this mouse is ambidextrous. And of course, all buttons are customizable.


The gaming mouse also has onboard memory, so no matter how you decide to customize your buttons you can save them straight to your mouse for ease of use. No more going in the settings menu of every game you play and doing it manually.


Now, like the Razer Viper Ultimate, this gaming mouse has no delay between hand movement and on-screen motion. That is because of what Logitech is calling Lightspeed wireless; like Razer’s Hyperspeed, you would be able to experience the benefits of a wired mouse without any of the drawbacks. 


This couples with Logitech’s new Hero 25K gaming sensor, which has been optimized to track the fastest flicks of the hand at speeds over 400 IPS, delivering optimal performance with zero smoothing, acceleration, or filtering from up to 25,600 DPI.


This is a mouse that deserves all the praise that it is getting, but that doesn’t mean it has no negatives. For example, while most buttons on the mouse do their job perfectly, the scroll wheel might feel a bit finicky at times when pressed, and while I am not a lefty myself I was told that there are better ambidextrous mice out there.

Part of the Logitech family, the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum has to be the most well designed and all-around best FPS mouse of all time. From the way it feels to its software and performance, this gaming device has all that you need and then some.


The best way I can describe this mouse is that it’s futuristic and fully customizable. The Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum features a total of 11 remappable buttons, including the metal mouse wheel which feels smooth, confident, and satisfying to control. All of the studs, including the wheel, are equipped with microswitches and rated up to 20 million clicks.


Not satisfied with the 11 buttons you can remap? Well not to worry, with the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum you can optimize the weight distribution of your mouse. That’s right, five 3.5 g weights come with the mouse, and each one is configurable. You can have the majority of the weight either on the front or back side, or left or right side. Each and every single person has a different body, from head to arms to hands, so what is considered comfortable will differ from person to person. That’s why I personally think this is a great addition to the device, not to mention a very unique one at that. Honestly, if I wasn’t such a casual pleb, I could see myself taking the time to tinker with the mouse in order to find the most comfortable feel for me.


But weight and a large amount of buttons are not the only thing that’s customizable with this mouse. Like any other high-end gaming device, the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum also glows. You can customize the light that comes out of your fps mouse with over 16 million colors, and you can sync your full RGB spectrum to what’s happening on screen with lighting effects and animations. For example, if you were to die, the mouse color would change to red, but if you were to get a kill it would change to blue. That’s how I would do it, but with so many options, you can find your own unique effects and sync them to your team’s colors (if you have any).


If you think we are done with the customization part of things, you are dead wrong my good friend. You see, this gaming mouse has gone all out to make your playtime as fun and as comfortable to your person as possible: you can also customize the optical sensor by fine tuning it to the surface you are playing on. You don’t have a pro gamer mat? Not a problem. No matter the surface, top precision and responsiveness are guaranteed. 


With all this customization, it would be a real pain if you would have to do it every single time you start a new game or decide to play on another PC. That’s why the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum has 3 on board memory slots; no matter where you go, all your customizations will be saved directly on your mouse.


Those are some great features, and what’s even grander is the gaming mouse’s advanced optical sensor. It has zero acceleration and zero smoothing or filtering across the entire DPI range, which by the way stands at 200-12,000. 


Speaking of DPI, you can change it on the fly – and yes that rhyme was on purpose. You can change it with a single button on the side; use the thumb button to transition from headshot precision to fast and unpredictable maneuvers as quickly as one, two, three – maybe even quicker.


The amazing features and customizability is good and all, but there are some nitpicks I have to get out of the way before we continue. Let’s start with the most glaring issue: this amazing fps mouse is not ambidextrous, so only right-handed people can experience its customizability. I know if I was left-handed, I would be miffed. And the other, much smaller issue is that the metal scroll wheel is a bit loud compared to other similar gaming mice. I can see how this would be a problem for some people, but it isn’t for me.


So is this mouse for you? Well personally, I love this fps mouse,  because it has top-of-the-line features and one-of-a-kind customization. But as I mentioned before, I am more of a casual gamer, so I still prefer the Glorious Model O which is similar. However, if I really got into the competitive scene of some game – any game really – I would love to have this piece of tech next to me.

We are starting this list light. The Glorious Model O is quite frankly, well, glorious. The small lightweight mouse was developed by gamers for gamers, and it describes itself as the world’s lightest gaming mouse. Let me tell you right here, that is not an exaggeration. I actually got the chance to try this bad boy for myself, and it’s a game-changer. Especially for those of us who like to play competitively. Best of all? The Glorious Model O is ambidextrous.


The design features a honeycomb style on the back and on the belly, which is the key to the light feel of the mouse. The holes are barely noticeable when you get into the zone, and they provide a much needed ventilation that keeps your palms cool and sweat free. You want to know the best part? It’s incredibly easy to clean; all you need is an air canister and – bam! good as new.


But there is more to this particular mouse than just a cool design and a light feel; I have to mention the cable. Yes, I’m not joking, the cable. Anyone who has played games competitively or has maybe gotten too into a particular title would know how annoying it is when the mouse’s cord gets in the way of your pentakill. That’s why some gamers prefer to use a wireless gaming mouse (soft plug). Wireless mice are good and all, but then you run the risk of running out of batteries when it’s most important (speaking from experience). 


The Glorious Model O chooses to go in a different direction and make its cord an asset. The long cable is light and flexible, so much so that you won’t even notice it when playing. What’s more, you can get it in multiple colors which are separate from the mouse, so it can fit with your aesthetic more smoothly.


Speaking of things being smooth – great segue I know – the Glorious Model O has some incredible feet. Its round edges will make your mouse glide on the pad like an Olympic ice-skater on a frozen lake. 


Want to be even more impressed than you already are? Let me tell you about the Glorious Model O’s more technical specs. This glorious piece of hardware has an incredible DPI indicator that you can adjust for value and colors, so you know what’s happening on the fly. 


Much more than that, the mouse has a Pixart 3360 Sensor, which is the esports industry standard. The Pixart 3360 Sensor gives the Glorious Model O a polling rate of 1000 Hz, less than 0.7mm lift-off distance, and zero mouse acceleration.


At this point you are probably saying to yourself: “Edward, you’ve sung the praises of this gaming mouse, we get it, now what are the cons?” And that is a fair question, but therein lies the problem: this mouse is just too good. Even the price is a big plus; you would expect a device such as this to cost an arm and a leg, but it’s a lot less expensive than most other high-end gaming mouses at just around 50 bucks. But this is a review after all, so I will do my best to nitpick a bit.


First off, the Glorious Model O has RGB lights all around it, and while that is aesthetically pleasing you may not get the exact color that you wanted. That’s not to say that if you pick the color green the mouse would glow purple; more like if you pick red and you expect the glow to be crimson, you might get cranberry instead. This may seem like an insignificant issue and, well, it is.


A much greater concern for some people, however, is the lack of buttons. Apart from the three main ones, the Glorious Model O has three extra: one on the top and two on the side, which is perfectly fine when you are playing an FPS or any other game apart from an MMO. The hardcore MMO fans might be dissatisfied by the lack of extra buttons, but you can’t have the world’s lightest mouse with a dozen or so side studs. If you want to find out more about this, I implore you to check out our best MMO mouse list.


All in all, would I recommend this mouse? Yes, yes I would if that was not already obvious. The issues are nitpicks at best, unless you are an MMO player, and the quality this mouse provides is immeasurable . Especially for the price. Not to mention for an FPS player, the lighter the mouse, the better.


Personally, I have been using this particular device for quite some time now and am extremely satisfied. I would recommend it to anyone, even if they are just a casual gamer.

If the Glorious Model O is the best lightweight mouse with ambidextrous quality, then the Steelseries Sensei 310 has to be the best ambidextrous mouse around that provides maximum comfort and flexibility for both claw and finger-tip grip styles.


The design features a core of Fiber-Reinforced Plastic (FRP), the same material that is used in advanced engineering structures ranging from ships to aircrafts to yes, even space crafts. So basically the core of this mouse is made out of the same thing that rockets are made out of, so maybe it’s a little more durable than your standard plastic mouse, just a little bit.


That extremely durable FRP is topped with fingerprint resistant semi-rough matte, so not only will your mouse feel expensive but you also won’t leave any marks on it, no matter how many chips you have eaten. And if you are anything like me, that would be a lot, a lot of chips. 


However, don’t let the semi-rough bit fool you – the Steelseries Sensei 310 is quite comfortable to the touch, especially when you add the pure silicon grips on both sides of the mouse – they’ll make you wish every mouse had them. You know what they say, right? Once you go pure silicon grips, you can’t go back. Yeah, that doesn’t really work, but you get my meaning. 


What makes this mouse truly ambidextrous, however, is not only the fact that it has silicon grips on both sides whereas most would have it only on one, but it also has buttons on both sides. Unlike the Glorious Model O, which claims to be ambidextrous but has two studs on just the left face of the mouse, the Steelseries Sensei 310 has two on either side, so no matter which hand you use, you can make it comfortable to you personally. With all of that said, this device has a total of 8 buttons, the 3 main ones 1 behind the mouse wheel, 2 on the left and 2 on the right side of the mouse. Each one is customizable and can have its own unique use, depending on your preference. 


You also don’t have to worry about the buttons wearing down, as the mouse’s extreme durability makes it an industry leader with over 50 million mechanical clicks and a fast and consistent feel.


This means you could spend years 360 no-scoping with their top of the line 1 to 1 sensor tracking, which will give you ultra-low latency and pinpoint accuracy as well as 1 ms (1000 Hz) pulling rate and zero, yes zero hardware acceleration.


All of this is supported by a powerful 32-bit ARM processor, which also allows you to save CPI settings, button remapping, and lighting effects without any additional software.


The Steelseries Sensei 310 was designed with professional players in mind, but that does not mean that it’s not for casual gamers as well. For me, it’s a great piece of hardware that deserves all the recognition it is getting, but the one glaring downside is its weight. When you have so much going on, you can’t expect a light mouse, and this one is quite heavier than our previous entry. While it is made for both claw and finger-tip grip styles, people with larger hands would find it much easier to handle. So should you buy it? 


It all depends on your play style; if you are the type of person who rushes into the front lines with an SMG, then you may need something more maneuverable – take another look at the Glorious Model O. But if you are the type to take your time and aim, then the comfort and 1 to 1 tracking of the Steelseries Sensei 310 would be perfect for you. 


Look at it this way: the Glorious Model O is meant for scouts, while the Steelseries Sensei 310 is better suited for snipers.

The Corsair Ironclaw RGB is, quite frankly, the biggest PC mouse I have ever seen – and the best gaming mouse for big hands there is. If the Steelseries Sensei 310 would be difficult to handle for people with smaller hands, then the Corsair Ironclaw RGB would be a nightmare. This mouse was designed specifically for large hands and palm-grips.


This big gaming mouse has everything that you would need. Rubber grips line both sides of the device, with the left side taking up most of that cover while the right side remains empty by comparison. That’s because this mouse was designed specifically for right-handed people, specifically right-handed people with big hands. 


In addition to the three main mouse buttons, the Corsair Ironclaw RGB has four more, two on the left side and two on top, each and every one of which is fully keymappable. 


But this large gaming mouse offers more than its suitability for large hands, of course; it is also quite durable.  With its Omron switches, the Corsair Ironclaw RGB will last you more than 50 million clicks, which is really great considering that its 18,000 DPI precision optical sensor would instantly turn anyone who picks it up into a pro player. Okay, that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but good hardware and performance does help. Luckily, the Corsair Ironclaw RGB does not lack in either department.


Boasting a Pixart PMW3391 sensor with 1 DPI resolution step, this mouse will deliver surgical precision to any type of player, whether you prefer charging in with grenades and smg in hand or a more quiet, sniper-like approach. Hell, you can even calibrate the mouse to your mouse pad to maximize precision and accuracy.


So is this mouse for you? Well, I can tell you that when it comes to performance this mouse is a beast (no pun intended); my brother has been using it for a while, and from what he tells me it’s a pretty good piece of hardware. That doesn’t mean it’s for everyone, though. 


You see, my brother is a big guy with big hands – giant hands, enormous hands – so it suits him perfectly. As for myself, well – I am on the smaller side, at least compared to him, and while not downright uncomfortable, the Corsair Ironclaw RGB was not a good fit for me. I can see how a person with even smaller hands than mine would not find this piece of hardware worthwhile, no matter its precision. Not to mention that even for people like my brother, the button placements may feel awkward at times. So, if you have big hands I would definitely recommend it, but otherwise keep scrolling.

This is one of the best, if not the best, wireless fps mice out there. It’s also a top of the line Razer fps mouse, so I mean, come on, what more do you want? The Razer Viper Ultimate could be considered the opposite of the Corsair Ironclaw RGB; while the latter is meant for big hands, the former is on the significantly slimmer side, made for smaller hands. 


The Razer Viper Ultimate has a true ambidextrous design with both rubber grips and buttons placed symmetrically on both sides. Its slim frame made for small hands also allows it to boast the title of the world’s lightest wireless mouse (it is, however, still not as light as the Glorious Model O).


The Razer Viper Ultimate’s lightweight design and comfortable feel are complemented by the 100% PTFE mouse feet, which allow for a smooth and slick movement, no matter the surface. PTFE is the same material that is used to coat non-stick pans.


The Razer Viper Ultimate’s design is also complicated by the charging station, which when combined with the mouse looks like a rocket ship about to disengage from the space port. But the futuristic design is not all there is to this charging dock. It’s able to seamlessly integrate with both The Razer Viper Ultimate and other Razer Chroma-enabled devices, so I don’t see myself ever going back to replacing the batteries of a mouse ever again.


Now I know what you may be thinking: “This is all well and good, but aren’t wireless mice   significantly slower than traditional ones?” While that may be the case for most wireless gaming mouses, it is different with the Razer Viper Ultimate. Don’t get me wrong, I understand where you are coming from and I thought the same way about this one – until I actually tried it.


You see, Razer’s Hyperspeed Wireless technology makes this gaming mouse 25% faster then all the others (according to Razer). While I am not exactly sure about those numbers, I can tell you that this device is indeed faster. If you don’t believe me, you need only look at some of the top athletes in e-sports who have been using this competitively. In fact, Taco of Counter Strike fame says that this mouse is perfect for FPS games like CS: GO. 


The Hyperspeed technology not only allows the player the same response (or at the very least, a similar one) to that of a wireless mouse – it also allows the mouse to have low click latency and seamless frequency switching. And all of these abilities are only complemented by the Razer Viper Ultimate’s optical sensor.


With an industry-leading 20,000 DPI and a 99.6% resolution accuracy, you can rest easy knowing that even the smallest of movements is tracked with consistency, and yet, that is not even the best part. The sensor is equipped with smart tracking intelligence, so the more you play the more accurate the input becomes. And, Razer’s optical mouse switch uses infrared light beams which can register every click to the 0.2 millisecond, an industry-leading innovation in its own right.


So if you are not afraid that your mouse will run out of power mid-game (and with it’s 70 hour battery I don’t see how you would be) then I think you should definitely consider this one for your next big tournament arc, that is, if you have small or medium-sized hands. If your biological grippers are on the larger side, then you might find this slim frame a bit uncomfortable to handle. Nevertheless, I think it’s innovative technology – and I am a sucker for innovative technology – is worth the consideration. All of this makes Razer Viper Ultimate the best Razer fps mouse.

While we are still on the Razer hype train, let’s look at what may be the best Razer mouse as a whole, the Razer DeathAdder V2.


This is one of the best gaming mice on the market, and unlike its brother the Razer Viper Ultimate, this impeccable piece of hardware is meant mainly for medium to large hands. However, even if you have small hands, it is still an all-purpose device, it won’t be too difficult to handle like the Corsair Ironclaw RGB might be. 


This Razer FPS mouse boasts that it is the world’s most celebrated and awarded gaming mouse, which is mainly due to the ergonomic design. The mouse is perfect for a palm grip but also works well with both claw and fingertip styles.


Unlike its predecessors, the Razer DeathAdder V2 is significantly lighter with an optimized design for maximum comfort, so your hand won’t get too tired even after those long hours of climbing the ladder. 


Apart from the three main mouse buttons, the device features four additional ones: two big studs on the left hand side and two smaller ones on the top, behind the scroll wheel. Of course, each and every one of those is programmable, like any high-end gaming mouse.


What’s more than that however, is what Razer is calling their Instinctive Scroll Wheel Tactility which will allow you to circle through your weapons with significantly less resistance while still feeling solid. I gotta tell you, this is a big plus in my book. I have cycled through (pun intended) many a gaming mouse in my days, some cheap, some on the higher end of things. Each and every one of those has left me dissatisfied with the scroller. Either it has little to no resistance and feels like a cheap plastic, or it feels solid and it has too much resistance: so has been the everlasting struggle of Edward the gamer. But no more. It may seem like a small thing, but it really does make a difference.


But the wheel and light, comfortable design are not the only things that make this mouse one of the best. The cable, a piece of the hardware that many people disregard and underestimate, is actually one of the most important mouse components when it comes to fluidity of motion. A good cable can make or break a good mouse, and if you’d like to find out more about this, please take a look at our 
gaming mouse buyer’s guide
, where we go in-depth about what makes a good gaming mouse.


For now, let me just tell you that the Razer DeathAdder V2 has one of the best cables around. What they are calling the Speedflex is a flexible, braided cable designed to reduce drag, especially when you are doing quick motions. As I mentioned before, I got the chance to try this mouse myself, and I have to tell you, the difference a good cable makes is extraordinary.


But no matter how good the design of a device is, it won’t perform well without good hardware as well. Luckily the Razer DeathAdder V2 has got us covered. Like its sister the Razer Viper Ultimate, this mouse is equipped with Razer’s optical mouse switch for much faster button response time, as well as Razer’s Focus+ optical sensor, so the industry-leading 20,000 DPI with 99.6% resolution accuracy is guaranteed. 


Great hardware is not the only thing these two share; they also have the same 100% PTFE Mouse Feet and advanced onboard memory storage. In fact, when you look at the Razer Viper Ultimate and the Razer DeathAdder V2, the two gaming mice almost seem like twins, which is not a bad thing. After all, it’s really hard to improve on the best of the best.


But the best doesn’t always mean perfect – the Razer DeathAdder V2 has its own drawbacks as well. For starters, this gaming mouse is not ambidextrous and is only meant for right-handed people, so if you are a lefty, well then that sucks I guess. Other than that, while the buttons are extremely responsive, they might feel a bit flimsy at times.


So if you are a Razer fan, I don’t see those small nitpicks getting in the way of your purchase, and even if you generally dislike Razer as a company, well, even then I would still give this Razer product a consideration.

So far we have looked at a lot of interesting designs on this list, with even more yet to come. Some will be inspiring, others innovative, but only one of them can be called the best designed FPS mouse: that title has to go to the HK Gaming Mira-M. After all, design does not refer only to the look of a gaming mouse.


The HK Gaming Mira-M is a slim, symmetrical device, and like the Glorious Model O before it, it features a honeycomb design on its surface, which adds a more light and relaxed feel to the mouse. 


The matte coating feels pleasant to the touch, and despite what you may think, the mouse keeps your hand cool even in the hottest of summer days – hmm, maybe that’s because of the honeycomb holes plastered all over. I realize that particular aesthetic choice is not for everyone, but you cannot deny its functionality.


The HK Gaming Mira-M gaming mouse also features a 100% PTFE feet which allow for smooth movement on most surfaces, while the paracord cable feels similar to that of the Razer DeathAdder V2’s Speedflex. It allows for a free movement of motion whilst being barely noticeable, even during fast-paced engagements.


As for the gaming mouse’s buttons besides the three main mouse buttons: it has three additional ones, two on the side and one on the top, and while it claims to be ambidextrous, the two side studs can only be found on the left side of the device. All of the buttons, including the three main ones, feel solid and easy to the touch. This is of great importance, especially when it comes to the mouse wheel, which glows by the way (this is still a gaming device after all).


The design is great, but what about the performance? Well, I can tell you that this fps mouse does not disappoint. The Mira-M actually features the same optical sensor as the Glorious Model O (Pixart 3360) which we already went over at the beginning, so I won’t go into too much detail. I will just say that anyone who plays FPS games and has not at least tried a fast-paced or super lightweight gaming mouse is doing themselves a disservice.


The HK Gaming Mira-M also has something called Enhance Pointer Precision, which automatically changes the DPI based on how quickly you move the mouse. This is a great addition in my opinion, but if you don’t like the idea, you will need to download a separate software as the feature is enabled by default.


I feel like this mouse is the younger cousin of the Glorious Model O. If the latter was a Usain Bolt then the HK Gaming Mira-M would be Tyson Gay or Yohan Blake – and if you don’t get that reference, look it up.


 
 
Pros
 




 Fast-Paced and Precise

 Additional software necessary to disable unwanted features

We all know and love the classic design of a mouse, resembling a turtle-like shell; it has been embedded into our minds as the way a gaming mouse or any kind of mouse, really, should look. In fact, I wouldn’t fault you if you thought that there are no other options; after all, how could a computer mouse look any different? The Logitech MX Vertical, that’s how.


Most gaming mice have more or less the same design; some companies choose to expand on it but still keep the blueprint we have all known for as long as computers have been around. Well, the Logitech MX Vertical resembles more of a vortex on a stormy sea than anything else.


The wireless mouse combines an ergonomic style with a science-driven design. It is made specifically to reduce discomfort and muscle strain and improve posture during those long hours of climbing the ladder. 


The ergonomic gaming mouse stands vertically at a 57 degree angle with a little island on the left side for your thumb called the thumb rest area. The unique design is said to reduce wrist pressure by 10% when compared to traditional gaming mice. In fact, Logitech claims that it has been tested by leading ergonomists who are confident in its abilities. Whether this is true or not, you will have to make up your own mind.


As for the quality and texture, well I gotta say it’s really pleasant to the touch. Designed for several hand shapes and sizes, the Logitech MX Vertical is smooth to the touch, yet its rubbery surface assures a solid grip.


While the design is interesting to say the least, I know what you are really here for: you want to know how this fps mouse performs. Short answer, pretty well. Long answer, well, let’s start with the 3 additional buttons – one on the top and two just above the thumb rest area, all of which are, of course, remappable.


You can also change the speed of your cursor with the press of a button, and the 4000 DPI high-precision sensor will serve you quite well. The DPI height may be significantly smaller than our other entries on this list, and while I see that putting some people off, arguably smaller DPI is way better. 4000 is plenty in my opinion.


So would I recommend this mouse? And who is it really for? Well, with the Logitech MX Vertical it really depends on the person, much more than any other gaming mouse. The Logitech MX Vertical has a few things going for it and few things against: the vortex or handshake shape, as Logitech puts it, allows for better immersion in a game as it actually feels like you’re holding something (like a gun). If you have some wrist problems or find that your hand is hurting after a long gaming session, then maybe you should also consider this fps mouse as an alternative.


No matter what you think of the design, as much as I hate to say this, I cannot put into words the way this mouse feels. You can only know if you experience it for yourself. For some it will become the new normal, while others might be disgusted with it. Personally, I don’t think it’s for me, but that doesn’t mean it’s not for you. The right Logitech mouse for you could also be on our list of best Logitech gaming mice.

On this list we have everything from the most lightweight mouse to the best of the best in the FPS gaming world. All of which will set you back about 50-60 bucks, and some *cough* *cough* wireless mice will be even more than that. If you don’t have the money to spare or simply don’t feel comfortable throwing away 10 Big Mac Meals for a gaming mouse, then not to worry, the SteelSeries Rival 3 is the one for you. 


This budget FPS mouse provides all of the functionality and precision of the more expensive options for half the price, only without all the fancy and futuristic designs. But that doesn’t mean that the gaming mouse itself looks bad; in fact, it’s quite the contrary.


At first glance, the ergonomic design looks like your typical black office mouse, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. You see, the mouse was designed with comfort in mind, and in that it succeeds. Its lightweight design reduces the strain from your shoulders and helps you relax. I gotta say, there is something pleasant about a simple, slick mouse, but maybe that is just me.


Don’t worry though, despite its simple design this is still a gaming mouse, so it has RGB lighting both on the back and on the bottom of the device. You can pick your favorite colors and match them with your glowing keyboard.


The SteelSeries Rival 3 also has two buttons on the left-hand side which you can bind however you like and store in the onboard memory, along with the polling rate and up to 5 CPI (counts per inch). 


The shape of the fps mouse itself allows for both a claw grip and fingertip grip styles, but sadly no palm grips.


Don’t be fooled – just because this mouse is on the cheaper side and is not made for a palm grip style (can you tell that’s my preferred grip?) doesn’t mean that it’s not well made. In fact, with over 60 million clicks and its high-grade polymer, the SteelSeries Rival 3 was built to last. Actually, it seems more durable than some of our other more expensive options, so much so that I am sure this FPS mouse could outlast all the others unless you get angry while playing Dark Souls. Then again, who plays Dark Souls with a mouse?


Actually, it doesn’t matter if it’s Dark Souls, Call Of Duty, or Overwatch; the SteelSeries TrueMove Core Sensor has a 1 to 1 tracking guarantee, no matter what war crimes you are committing. With a range of 200 to 8,500 CPI, it ensures accuracy, speed, and consistency, as much as our other high-end entries.


This mouse is great for what it is, and I would definitely recommend it for someone who is just dipping their toes in the gaming world or simply doesn’t want to splurge on a new gaming mouse. But, it does have some issues. For starters, the side buttons are a bit hard to press and the scroll wheel is a bit further down than I would personally like it to be. But other than that, it’s the perfect starter mouse, unless you use the palm grip style, like me.

Pros
 




 Affordable


 Great Durability


 On-Par with other high-end devices




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Side buttons are hard to press

 Not suitable for palm grips




 
 
 


Honorable Mentions


Whether you are left-handed or right-handed, whether you use a palm grip or a fingertip grip, or even a claw grip, the FPS gaming world has something for everyone. In fact, we have so many options that it could be hard to choose the best fps gaming mouse, as all the entries on our list are unique in their own right and may appeal to different people. However, if you are still not satisfied and still haven’t found the best gaming mouse for you, then maybe some of our honorable mentions will help you narrow down your search.


Razer Basilisk Ultimate


Like all high-end Razer products, the Basilisk Ultimate excels in everything it does. This wireless gaming mouse has it all: 11 customizable buttons including customizable resistance on the scroll wheel, fully customizable lighting, and upto 100 hours of battery life. A great alternative to the Razer Viper Ultimate, the Razer Basilisk Ultimate is a weapon you’d want in your arsenal as much as any other gaming mouse on this list. 


Steelseries Rival 600


A heavyweight champion in its own right, the Steelseries Rival 600 could go toe-to-toe with the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum for the heavyweight belt. With a range weight of 96 to 128 grams, the Rival 600 is perfectly suited for players who love to be in control of every aspect of hardware. The fps mouse works perfectly with both palm grip and claw grip and is made to last.


Roccat Kova AIMO


Whether you prefer heavyweight or lightweight, you cannot deny that design plays a big role in the way a gaming mouse moves and feels. The Roccat Kova AIMO has one of the most ergonomic and versatile shapes out there. This ambidextrous mouse was built for every type of gamer and every type of grip style; doesn’t matter if it’s palm grip, claw grip, or even fingertip grip, this mouse will feel comfortable and easy to use.


Methodology


Like most of you, I have grown up with video games. I have played everything, from the original Call Of Duty to World Of Warcraft and even Civilization VI. It’s safe to say that gaming is one of my all-time favorite hobbies, and throughout my 24 years of life, I have gone through a great many gaming mice. Some have been terrible and some have been amazing, but none of them compare to the ones on this list. 


Writing this article on the best FPS gaming mouse has been a complete and utter pleasure. Not only have I tried fps mice I would never have tried otherwise, I also get to talk about my hobby. Now, as much as I love gaming, I simply have no use for 10 high-end FPS mice, so I did not personally buy all of them. I did, however, test all of them. 


Some, like the Glorious Model O, I own myself, while others like the Corsair Ironclaw RGB I stole from my brother. Others still I managed to get from co-workers. Now obviously, I couldn’t get my hands on all of the gaming mice in this article from friends, family or co-workers, and for a while I was stuck. I thought that my only options were to scour the internet for every single bit of information I could get on the devices and write it down in my little green notebook. But, I thought I’d lose some of the personal touch of my reviews in the process or would have to spend a lot of money on the gaming mice and run at a loss, even if I sell them afterwards. 


For a while I was conflicted as to what to do, but I finally decided that as inconvenient as it would be, I don’t want to lose the personal touch in my writing. That’s when I discovered that you could actually rent gaming mice, among other things, like keyboards. I have to tell you, when I found this out, I exhaled a sigh of relief and kicked myself for not knowing this sooner. All in all, in the end I tested every single mouse I could get my hands on and wrote everything down in my little green notebook. 


Buyers Guide


Gaming mice have a lot of features that normal mice don’t, but whether those features are good or not is another topic entirely. You see, a good gaming mouse must have an advanced optical or laser sensor, as well as a degree of customizability. 


A Proper Gaming Sensor


When it comes to gaming mice, there are two types of sensors available: a laser sensor and an optical one. Arguably, the latter is the better choice. 


Mouse sensitivity is measured in DPI (dots per inch), and laser mice sometimes have a higher DPI then optical ones. Most professional players and competitive players in general prefer to lower their DPI manually as a low DPI translates to better accuracy, making the laser sensor a bit redundant.  As for accuracy itself, as long as you are not playing on a reflective surface the optical sensor is still the better choice, as it allows you to consistently flick your mouse without any acceleration.


But no matter how accurate and sensitive a sensor is, it is still pointless if it breaks on you. Here still, the optical is the better option as it has no moving parts; it’s more durable and doesn’t require any cleaning, unlike the laser sensor.


Customizability


A good gaming mouse will have a great degree of customizability, from remapping the buttons to changing the weight of the device and much more.


Most high-end gaming mice come with their own customization software where you can influence everything from the lighting effects to even different button profiles for different games. Customizability is really important in the gaming world, especially when it comes to FPS games and button remapping; that’s why most FPS mice also come with onboard memory so you won’t have to redo the buttons for every game you play.


Conclusion


There are so many details to go over when considering a gaming mouse that I can’t possibly cover them all in one single section; that’s why I have created an article specifically dedicated to the
 buyers guide
 for a gaming mouse. 


Think of this as an introduction to that article if you want to learn more about what makes a good gaming mouse.


Final Verdict


While there are many gaming mice out there, for all your gaming needs, each with their own unique qualities and functions, my personal favorite of all the FPS devices on this list, has to be the Glorious Model O.


Unpopular opinion over here: I actually like the honeycomb design, and no one can deny its practical use as well. I love the lightweight feel of the Glorious Model O and the way it slides on my gaming mat. 


While I love the best lightweight gaming mouse, my brother is the opposite. He hates the honeycomb design and for him, the mouse just doesn’t feel right – and that’s fine. People, even if they’re family, are different and unique in their own right, and that’s why there are so many diverse options in the best FPS mouse list, so everyone will find something they like and maybe even a new favorite. 


Even my brother could let go of his old favorite the Corsair Ironclaw RGB after I let him try the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum, which he simply fell in love with. Well, at least now I know what I’ll be getting him for his birthday, unless he buys it himself first.


FAQ


Q: What is the difference between a gaming mouse and a regular mouse?


A: The main difference is DPI (dots per inch); a gaming mouse has much higher DPI than a regular one. But there are many more differences besides this one; I recommend our gaming mouse buyers guide for more information.


Q: Do I really need a gaming mouse?


A: Well, it depends on a lot of personal factors. Are you playing casually or are you more competitive? Do you mainly play Minecraft or are you a hardcore MMO or FPS stan? Only you can answer these questions; all I can tell you is that a gaming mouse will elevate your skills to a new level and in my opinion make your playthrough more enjoyable.


 Q: I own an MMO gaming mouse. Could I use it for FPS games?


A: Technically, yes. However, MMO mice are different from FPS mice. They might not be as comfortable for first person shooters, as the MMO gaming mouse has way more buttons on the side which will remain useless in your FPS games. For more information, I recommend our Best MMO Gaming Mouse article.

WiFi Boosters for RV: Top 10 Reviewed Extenders for 2022,https://10beasts.com/wifi-booster-rv/,"



Being on the road in an RV once used to be synonymous with going offline for a few days.


Luckily, this doesn’t have to be the case anymore – thanks to the invention of specialized WiFi boosters, extenders, and repeaters for RV use! These brilliant devices stay true to their name, and boost, extend, and repeat or forward your WiFi router’s existing Internet signals so that they can successfully reach every corner of your RV’s interior. 


Some extenders are even powerful enough to extend the router’s signals to outside your RV, too. A few special campground WiFi signal booster devices can generate their own signals to support Internet browsing (like the Winegard WF-4035, for example). 


A typical WiFi extender or repeater will connect to your WiFi router and 
create amplified signals
 that go much farther than the router’s original range, as discussed above. This is particularly useful when you’re camping outdoors, but your router’s signal range is limited to the insides of your RV only, for example. 


If the device is labeled as a “booster,” it may improve the original signal’s speed and strength which can often deteriorate the further you get from the main router. 


Typically, devices with longer antennas offer an improved signal extension range, as do ones with multiple antennas. WiFi antenna for RV length and quantity is one of the many important device characteristics you should keep an eye out for when browsing the market for a suitable WiFi extender product. 


If you’d like to know more about what to look for in an RV WiFi extender, I’d recommend reading over the buyer’s guide at the end of this article. The guide contains everything you need to know about these essential RV devices and can help you make an informed decision when choosing a product. 


Before you jump into the buyer’s guide, though, why not check out my top 10 WiFi signal boosters for RV devices? I’ve listed them below with detailed reviews of each product so you can fully understand the product well before confirming the purchase.


So, are you ready to learn more about extenders, boosters, and repeaters that can amplify your WiFi in RV experience?

The Winegard 434719 is an excellent device that serves both as a router and a WiFi extender, depending on how you choose to run it.


So, if you already have a suitable WiFi system in place, you can simply connect the Winegard 434719 to it, and watch as this remarkable device extends the existing WiFi signals.


However, being on the road in an RV can trigger instability in your WiFi signals, which is why some people prefer switching over to 4G LTE instead. Luckily, this device contains a SIM slot inside which you can easily fit your sim card. 


If you have already subscribed to a 4G package, feel free to broadcast those signals using the Winegard 434719. If not, you can always subscribe to one of Winegard’s own Internet 4G LTE plans for a reasonable price.


 
 
Pros
 




 Long, 20 ft. power cable

 Also connects to external WiFi router signals




 
 
 
 
Cons

The NETGEAR N300 WiFi extender offers a brilliant 600 sq. ft. WiFi extension range, allowing it to easily cover your entire RV and even broadcast its signals outside your vehicle. 


RVs are seldom larger than 400 sq. ft. – they cannot go beyond this capacity by law, which is why a device with a 600 sq. ft. range makes for an ideal RV WiFi booster. 


This WiFi booster contains external antennas. These help ensure that its broadcasted signals are evenly arranged through space, allowing the entire RV access to a reliable and strong Internet connection. 


Additionally, this WiFi range extender offers a healthy 300 Mbps speed, allowing for speedy downloads and uninterrupted streaming sessions. 


It is compatible with most WiFi router options. It can support a range of host devices, including PlayStations, Apple products, and Android devices.

Contrary to popular belief, not every WiFi extender needs to be wireless. Some devices, like the Bearifi BearExtender, use a sturdy and reliable USB cable to connect one’s PC to their WiFi router. 


This device is perfect for when your regular WiFi router’s signals are severely compromised. However, please note that this is not a repeater. You cannot string multiple PC devices onto it. It doesn’t support Android, iOS, or Mac OS, either. 


Feel free to use it with any Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, or 10 devices, though. 


This extender contains a 10 dBi gain-integrated directional patch antenna to catch your WiFi signals and a 16-ft.-long shielded USB cable to transmit it to your PC device. 


 
 
Pros
 




 IP65 certified water-resistant body


 Anti-UV and anti corrosion device coating


 Multiple mounting options: tripod mount, Velcro strap railing attachment, and adjustable metal pole mounting option




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Limited to 16 ft. range


 Only works with 1 PC at a time

The KING KF1000 Falcon contains automatic directional WiFi antennas that rotate by themselves to help effectively catch nearby WiFi signals without the need for manual setup interference. 


It is compatible with all devices that support WiFi connectivity, including mobile devices, PCs, and Smart TVs. What’s better is that the KF1000 Falcon takes mere minutes to set up, thanks to the brilliant KING app available on both iOS and Android. 


This device weighs just 2.7 lbs, so you can easily fasten it anywhere without worrying about it falling off. This feature is extremely useful for RVs; these vehicles contain limited free space, which is why it’s challenging to find a designated spot for your WiFi extender. Luckily, the KF1000 Falcon is compact and lightweight enough to fit virtually anywhere with ease!


 
 
Pros
 




 Setup supported by KING app (iOS and Android)


 Automatic directional WiFi antenna to effectively extend WiFi range


 1-year warranty period




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Cannot be used as a stand-alone WiFi hotspot


 Must be supported by an external WiFi router

This device contains a robust fiberglass exterior casing that helps it stay in top condition even when placed in a rough outdoor setting. Furthermore, it comes with an external RV booster tube that effectively extends distant pre-existing WiFi signals.


It can scan existing WiFi routers even if they’re a few hundred feet away, which is what makes this device so brilliant. You don’t need to worry about having your WiFi router extremely close to establish a strong connection with it.


This device, however, is solely dependent upon preexisting WiFi signals and cannot generate any of its own, so keep that in mind before making the purchase!


 
 
Pros
 




 Easy setup thanks to special setup wizard


 Strong, fiberglass-encased exterior makes it perfect for outdoor use


 Lightweight and easy to mount on walls




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Limited to extending existing WiFi signals only


 Expensive for a device that only offers repeating technology

This WiFi booster offers an impressive range of 3 miles, meaning it can cover both your RV and the entire base camp or area where your vehicle is parked! 


The CC Vector WiFi receiver system can support multiple devices at a time and contains a sturdy and reliable stainless-steel body that’s suitable for outdoor use. However, it maintains average protection against the rain, which is why it’s better to keep it away from water if possible. 


This device weighs just 1.55 lbs, making it easy to mount anywhere. The body bears a compact design, too, and can easily fit into smaller spaces that are less than 6 inches wide. However, the antenna is 11.5 inches tall, which is why you’ll need ample overhead space to keep this device in place. 


 
 
Pros
 




 Compact fit body


 Rustproof, stainless-steel exterior


 Incredible range (3 miles)




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Expensive


 Has a history of reducing WiFi speed when the original connection passes through this repeater

WiFi Booster for RV Buyer’s Guide


The market is virtually overflowing with a wide selection of WiFi booster devices. However, not all of these are worth considering, and some are undeniably better than others. 


Below is a detailed buyer’s guide that contains everything you need to know about WiFi booster devices. Reading over it will help you make an informed decision about your upcoming WiFi booster for RV purchase.


Here is a list of things to keep in mind when choosing a WiFi booster for RV.


Data Transfer Rate (Supported Internet Speed)


Your device’s data transfer rate, also known as its “supported Internet speed,” refers to how fast your WiFi connection will be. 


Every WiFi booster has a maximum data transfer rate measured in megabits per second (Mbps). The greater the number of Mbps your device supports, the faster your Internet speed will be.


Security Protocol


Your Internet connection will help relay some important private information from your PC to another. This may include sensitive data such as bank passcodes and credit card information. 


To ensure no third-party server hacks into your network connection and conducts a data breach, I’d advise you to look for WiFi boosters that contain a supported security protocol system. Popular examples include WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA-Enterprise.


You should also make sure that your WiFi connection is protected by a strong password. The risk of a data breach is much higher when you’re traveling in an RV because you’re bound to make stops and regularly come into contact with strangers – be careful because some of them might just try and hack into your system! 


However, you’ll have nothing to worry about if your connection is protected by a strong password and reliable security protocol (like WPA). So, be sure to select a booster device that contains these safety measures! 


Maximum Range


WiFi extenders solely exist to improve your existing WiFi signal’s range. So, it makes sense to look into a WiFi booster device’s maximum range allowance before buying it. 


If you plan on staying indoors when surfing the Internet, I’d suggest looking for a casual WiFi booster that allows a minimum 300 sq. ft. extension range. RVs cannot be larger than 400 sq. ft. by law – and only a small fraction of RV reach this number – so a 300 sq. ft. range threshold should suffice. Anything beyond this is purely good luck.


However, if you plan on accessing the internet outside your RV’s four walls, I’d suggest getting something with a range that’s at least beyond 400 sq. ft. Some WiFi extenders offer an extensive range that’s beyond a whole mile, too. Such devices are perfect for those RV travelers who often camp at RV basecamps and the like. 


So, before choosing a WiFi booster or extender for your RV trip, be sure to go over your range requirements. Knowing how far you need your WiFi signal to go can help you make an informed decision when picking out a suitable product.

Smartwatches for Android Phones: Top 10 Reviewed Watches for 2022,https://10beasts.com/best-smartwatches-android/,"



Smartwatches have taken the fitness world by storm, to the point that it’s common at many gyms today to see more people 
with
 a smartwatch than without. It’s easy to see why, too – smartwatches offer tons of passive benefits, even for folks who don’t go to the gym every day. Smartwatches can monitor your heart rate, help you adjust your sleeping habits, and even let you take calls or texts while your phone is on the treadmill counter.


Still, it’s taken me awhile to jump on the smartwatch bandwagon. Don’t get me wrong, they’re very interesting gadgets through and through, but I initially failed to see exactly why they were necessary unless you planned on using them every day. After all, I thought, aren’t smartwatches mostly for fitness fanatics?


But I was browsing Amazon one day and stumbled onto a selection of smartwatches for Android phones. Since I have an Android phone now, these seemed like perfect fits. The more I investigated, I found that the smartwatches on display weren’t 
only
 for people wanting to track their fitness progress. In fact, smartwatches are great for all kinds of uses, including people who like to pay without a physical card or guys like me who just enjoy having fun gadgets to fiddle with.


Suffice it to say that I plunged down into a smartwatch rabbit hole I’m ultimately glad I checked out. I delved deep into some of 
the best new smartwatches of 2022
. Plus, you benefit – I found 
some of the best Android smartwatches
 on the market for you to examine yourself. Note that many of these also work for other phones, like Google Pixel devices or iPhones. But I did specifically tailor the reviews for watches compatible with Android devices.


Anyway, let’s get down to it!

There are few smartwatches that impress as totally as the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3. Even I, with my more minimalist fashion sensibilities, found myself constantly tinkering with and playing with the watch since there’s just so much to do. I guess that also means it’s like an adult toy – you’ll never stop checking the watch and investigating its features if you like gadgets as much as I do!


Let’s get down to the details. For starters, the Galaxy Watch 3 offers multiple styles to choose from, allowing you to customize it to your aesthetic. There are two sizes in total (ideal for both men and women) and three colors. But more importantly, each new Android smartwatch comes with military-grade durability for the watch face. Basically, this means you won’t totally bust the watch if you accidentally slam it into the wall (guilty as charged).


But it’s also a great watch for taking out on a run, even in inclement weather, since it’s built with water resistance in mind. It can do all this even with a battery that lasts for over 24 hours on a single charge. Granted, it’s not the best smartwatch battery life you can find, but it’s certainly enough battery life to suit most folks’ needs.


What does the battery power? You’ll be able to connect the galaxy Watch 3 to your Android phone. This means that it’s the perfect watch for taking calls and connecting with your friends and peers while on the go. Even better, it connects via very strong Bluetooth signaling, and you’ll be able to opt-in to call notifications or text messaging indications for the same feature. This constant “plugged-in” nature makes it a great smartwatch for those who never want to be without their phone’s communication lifeline.


But it’s one of the best Samsung Android watches for fitness purposes as well. For instance, the Galaxy Watch 3 can record your ECG for up to 30 seconds, which is pretty standard across the fitness smartwatch industry. You do need an ECG-compatible smartphone for this to work, but most folks who are interested in this watch will already have a Galaxy smartphone to begin with.


The proprietary ECG monitoring app can also check for the signs of atrial fibrillation (which is a kind of irregular heart rhythm). Sharing the reports from the watch with your healthcare provider is extremely easy since the watch works with the proprietary Samsung Health Monitor app – again, this is when the watch is connected to a standard Galaxy phone.


Add to that an automatic sleep tracker (which can tell you how well you sleep every night), a highly-accurate GPS tracker for your runs, and a stress level monitor and you have a fantastic, health-improving watch that makes it suitable for high-energy, go-go-go professionals.


In this way, it’s an ideal GPS smartphone watch for those who already like their Galaxy smartphone and want to add even more functionality to it. All this focus on data 
might 
leave your security sensitivities tingling. But I found that the watch also came with multilayered digital security to keep your data safe. One last thing I noticed – it comes with voice control functionality and can even read your texts to you so you don’t have to take your eyes off the road. 


The downside? Ultimately, this Android Samsung watch is great if you have the money, but it’s also easily one of the most expensive Android smartwatches on the market. Then again, if you’re after the best of the best, there’s nothing (that I found, at least) that beats the Galaxy Watch 3.


 
 
Pros
 




 Features tons of tools and features


 An excellent pick for hands-free operation, as it can read texts and accept voice commands


 Comes in multiple sizes and styles for different users

 Very easy to monitor and share health reports through the watch and proprietary app


 Very durable on the exterior and comes with extra security features to protect your data




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Very expensive compared to other watches – only get this if you have a Galaxy smartphone and know that you’ll use all of its features for certain


 Battery life is okay, but could be better, especially considering the asking price

There are those of us who aren’t interested in super-expensive smartwatches, and I can’t blame you! For myself, I usually opt for gadgets and devices that are good enough rather than being top-tier, especially since cutting-edge gadgets usually have a few bugs or kinks to work out. To that end, I present the Galaxy Watch Active: an Android smartwatch with many of the same features as the last but without the exorbitant price tag.


It’s also a watch more straightforwardly designed for fitness fanatics. You can tell this by the fact that it can detect up to six exercises while you’re moving, plus track your results or progress for up to 39 more. It’s a perfect pick for crossfit enthusiasts or regular gym-goers who want to tangibly mark their progress as they go up in weight or shed pounds.


More than that, the watch can also help you rest better by analyzing your sleep patterns and setting automatic alerts to help to wind down and go to sleep at the same time every night. Considering that most modern sleep research indicates that setting a regular bedtime (and not staying on the computer until midnight) does wonders for your rest quality, this is a great feature that more smartwatches ought to offer.


The watch can also send you real-time alerts if it detects a low heart rate. Thus, it’s a great pick if you do have a heartbeat irregularity and your doctor has recommended that you keep an eye on the anomaly for the foreseeable future.


Alright, so it’s a great fitness watch. But what does it bring to the table in terms of raw enjoyment? It’s a lightweight but durable watch and I found it to be comfortable while exercising or when wearing it daily. Furthermore, it’s totally swim-ready since it’s waterproof and comes in a decent selection of colors. The bands are interchangeable, so it’s a fun watch if you like to adjust your look from time to time instead of being stuck with a single watch color.


The watch can also work with both Samsung Android smartphones and iOS phones so long as the operating system is 9.0 or higher. Most will still want to pair this with a Samsung smartphone, however. Once paired, it can sync with a music playlist and give you text or call alerts like most modern smartwatches on the market. It’s a smartwatch with long battery life and can run for up to several days on a single charge.


Ultimately, it’s a great alternative to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 if you want something more affordable with many of the same features. 


 
 
Pros
 




 Made with durable but lightweight materials to keep the watch soft and comfortable


 Comes in several colors and the bands are interchangeable to allow a degree of aesthetic flexibility


 The watch has lots of fitness-oriented features, making it ideal for regular exercisers


 Pairs with both Android and iOS smartphones and devices, offering some extra flexibility




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Not as good for hands-free operation, like when you’re driving


 Aesthetic is definitely “cheaper”/not suitable for some business or professional environments

Many smartwatches are simply too expensive for lots of regular people to get their hands on them. This is a shame, considering that smartwatches are fun and versatile devices that offer much more value than just a little exercise assistance. This being said, I was able to find a few more budget-friendly Android smartwatches on the market.


The Fitbit Versa Lite is, undoubtedly, one of the best Android watches I saw. The price, however, can oscillate depending on the color of the band, meaning that some Versa Lites are cheaper than others if you’re willing to stick with an ugly color. For instance, the bright, bubblegum pink color is the cheapest on the market at the time of this writing.


But for some, aesthetic is secondary to function, so the Versa Lite will ultimately be a great fit. Like most smartwatches, it can track a variety of daily activities 24/7, plus give you valuable data about your heart rate and sleep stages. It does all this pretty reliably since it has a four-day battery life with a single charge (though of course this varies based on how much you use it).


In total, the Versa Lite comes with over 15 exercise modes so you can record your workouts and connect to a smartphone for integration with various fitness apps. It also has pretty good GPS recording accuracy, meaning it’ll reliably track your pacing and distance. It’s a great, affordable smartwatch for runners who are more likely to be interested in a watch that works rather than a watch that turns heads.


The relatively wide screen allows you to access a multitude of apps without fumbling with the buttons – something I hate with other smartwatches. It also pairs pretty quickly to various smartphone types and can receive texts and other app alerts. If you pair the watch with an Android device, you can send quick replies to text messages or calls at the touch of a button. This is a really handy feature for those who primarily wear the watch while exercising and who don’t want to mess up their groove in the middle of a workout.


I also really like the slim and comfortable design of the watch. The watch’s body is made with lightweight and anodized aluminum. This just means that it won’t corrode very easily (something to consider if the watch rests on a sweaty wrist often). It’s also water resistant down to 50 m, meaning it’s functionally waterproof.


With all these plus sides, there are negatives to consider. As mentioned, some of the cheaper colors are pretty shockingly ugly. Furthermore, the watch does have some lag when you try to engage multiple functions at once. This can make the interface feel unintuitive or unresponsive. But it’s still a decent, affordable Android smartwatch all in all.


 
 
Pros
 




 Can be bought for a really reasonable asking price, especially compared to other smartwatches


 Has good GPS accuracy and a plethora of workout/exercise recording functions


 Can pair with multiple types of smartphones and offers quick replies when texting with Android phones


 Feels lightweight and comfortable
Made with durable aluminum materials and is very water-resistant




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Cheaper colors are not very good for business/professional use, though they’re okay for fitness-only use


 Internal software can be laggy sometimes

Some Android smartwatches are relatively gender-neutral, while others trend clearly toward one side of the sex spectrum. The Fossil Sport is clearly one of the latter, and I found that it fit perfectly on my more masculine wrist compared to many of the others on this list. Indeed, it’s designed for use by men (though women can still technically make it work) in terms of its aesthetic and a few of the features.


For example, many smartwatches designed to be used for women have women’s health fitness apps to track female-only health issues. This watch lacks those functionalities in exchange for more general features, like heart rate and activity tracking through Google Fit and fantastic built-in GPS tracking. This makes it a great watch for hiking or running, particularly in places where you’re a newcomer.


I mentioned Google Fit for a reason: this watch comes built with Google Assistant functionality ready to go. It’s super easy to engage this feature through voice commands alone, though be warned – the speaker isn’t super great at actually picking up your voice sometimes. But the Assistant is still a valuable feature overall, as it allows you to do things like:


Check out at various stores using the smartwatch
Download third-party apps with the touch of a button
Customize the watch face
Handle your music storage and controls
Set various alarms and alerts
Engage an LED flashlight
And more


There are, as you can see, a lot of practical tools built into this watch. This Android watch for men is a great casual or sportswear accessory for this reason alone. The watch does come with a downside in that it only has around 24 hours of battery life, whereas many other smartwatches come with longer lifespans of a few days on a single charge. Still, this downside doesn’t offset the sheer value offered here.


This Android men’s watch is extremely lightweight, built with an aluminum case and a durable silicone band. The bands are interchangeable and the watch comes in multiple sizes, but they all maintain the relatively rugged and minimalist aesthetic lots of men appreciate the Fossil brand for in the first place.


Is it right for you? I enjoyed my time with the Fossil Sport. But I also think there are flatly better options within this Android smartwatch review. It’s ultimately the best Android smartwatch for men who want something decidedly masculine and functional above all else.


 
 
Pros
 




 This watch has tons of features to sink your teeth into, including music control, a calendar, a stopwatch, and lots of fitness tracking functions


 Works with both iPhones and Android devices


 Syncs with Google Assistant and receives some voice commands for hands-free functionality


 You can customize the watch face to your liking


 Made with a sleek but rugged men’s aesthetic – it’s also durable enough for use in inclement weather




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Smartwatch battery life could certainly be better, although it can go up to two or three days depending on what functions you use


 The speaker for Google Assistant voice commands is spotty in certain areas

Many of the best Android smartwatches will, in fact, not be powered by an Android-specific OS at all. Instead, they’ll work with Wear OS: a special operating system developed by Google to work with most smartphone devices and offer intuitive functionality for the small screen sizes typical of most smartwatches on the market. Plus, Wear OS smartwatches are really great choices if you have an advanced Google Pixel phone. The Fossil Gen 5 is one of those, and it benefits from it tremendously.


For instance, it offers both a high-power and multi-day extended mode. This means the watch can last for up to 24 hours for faster responsiveness or for multiple days on lower power settings. It also comes with Google Fit built into its software. You’ll benefit from enhanced GPS tracking your distance measurements and for maintaining your fitness goals, wellness enhancements that let you track your sleep history, restfulness monitoring, heart rate monitoring, and much more.


Wear OS also allows you to customize the watch face with a startling degree of freedom. You don’t just get to pick from a few pre-made templates. Instead, you can personalize the display with tons of images or colors and select what information is always viewable on the watch screen. It offers hundreds of apps for downloading, including social, news, game, fitness, and payment apps all with the same interface. 


Additional women’s health apps make this one of the best Android smartwatches for women. But it’s a great smartwatch for Google Pixel phones, too, since you can benefit from some Google-only apps and features through the Wear OS.


It’s also a durable watch through and through, featuring a swim-proof design and a durable band that comes in silicone, leather, and metal options. Furthermore, this is one of the few smartwatches that can make calls without caveats or poor performance. It’s very easy to make and answer calls using the watch as long as it’s synced to your phone. Furthermore, voice quality is usually quite high for both ends of the conversation.


I also really liked the USB cable that comes with this heart rate monitor smartwatch. This includes a magnetic charger that can snap to the rings on the watch’s case back, plus spin 360° for easy charging in any environment. The charge time is also pretty rapid – it usually only takes about 90 minutes to go from no power to fully charged. 


It’s not the most noticeable watch on the market, but the customization and the fantastic spread of included features really make it worth most folks’ time in my opinion. Check it out if you want something intuitive, advanced, and well worth the middling asking price.


 
 
Pros
 




 Comes with three different band types depending on the aesthetic you want to prioritize


 Offers multiple battery life options


 Has a versatile USB cable and magnetic charger that recharges the battery quite quickly


 Comes with Wear OS and Google Fit, offering fantastic watch face customization options and hundreds of apps to make the watch perfectly fit your needs


 A great watch for making and receiving phone calls when synced to an applicable phone 


 One of the best smartwatches for synching with Google Pixel phones for added features and compatibility bonuses




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 The normal battery life setting could be a lot better, as there are plenty of other Android smartwatches with longer battery life spans

Most of the best Wear OS smartwatches are paired with cornerstone designers or brands, like Samsung, Fitbit, etc. However, there are a few lesser-known brands that combine the functionality and ease of use of Wear OS with their own unique spins on the smartwatch template. I really like the TicWatch E2 for this reason.


Let me break it down. Like all Wear OS smartwatches, it connects to online app stores and offers hundreds of apps for download as soon as you boot it up. It’s compatible with both Android and iPhone devices, so finding a selection of fitness and other apps that are perfect for your interests and needs is relatively quick and painless.


It also comes with Google Assistant built-in, which offers that AI’s staple functions like caller identification and notifications for your various installed apps, and easy integration with Google Pixel phones.


This Android Wear watch is also water resistant and swim ready; it can go down up to 50 m underwater without breaking. The rest of the watch is pretty durable, featuring a thick rubber/silicone band and a hard metal watch body. Even better, TicWatch offers a 30-day moneyback guarantee and a 12-month warranty for manufacturer issues. Talk about peace of mind!


It offers some great fitness-oriented apps and functions as well. The built-in GPS feature is fairly accurate, even when you’re away from civilization centers or big cities. Furthermore, the watch can accurately and reliably track your heart rate and other bodily functions.


What makes this watch stand out? In my opinion, this is one of the best Wear OS smartwatches you can get since it’s so affordable due to not being associated with any big brand. It still comes with all the same important features and design benchmarks you’d expect, like two-day battery life and Qualcomm Bluetooth chips for a strong connection. But you get all that value without having to pay up to 30% or 50% more just for brand-name recognition.


The downside? This Android Bluetooth watch is pretty thick and heavy compared to many others on the market, so those with thinner wrists might be interested in a different watch that doesn’t feel so solid on the wrist. But if you’re a gym-goer or exercise enthusiast, this is arguably one of the best fitness watch choices you can make.


 
 
Pros
 




 Comes with durable band and body


 Offers Wear OS and built-in Google Assistant


 GPS and other tracking functions are really accurate and consistent, meaning you shouldn’t experience any spotty coverage


 Comes with a 30-day moneyback guarantee and a 12-month manufacturer warranty


 Really affordable asking price despite all of the included features and functions, including hundreds of apps, easy Bluetooth connectivity, and waterproof functionality




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 The band and watch combined weigh nearly 8.4 ounces, which is significantly heavier and larger than many other slimmer Android smartwatches

Two screens? What am I on about?


Let me break it down. Some smartwatch faces are built with dual-layered screens to offer two modes of functionality. The TicWatch Pro is one of those devices. In a nutshell, its dual-layered watch face comes with an LCD screen on top that offers a long-lasting battery life of up to 30 days. This “essential” screen will allow you to keep using and enjoying the smartwatch for weeks on end, making it an ideal long-term hiking or camping companion if you won’t be able to recharge the watch for some time.


Beneath the LCD screen is an AMOLED screen, which works when the watch’s “smart mode” is engaged. This necessarily drains battery life more quickly, but it still offers a long-lasting battery life of between two and five days depending on the functions you use. In this way, the TicWatch Pro is versatile and reliable when other smartwatches might run out of battery and leave you hanging in a pinch.


There are other reasons that this watch made this review of the best Android smartwatches, of course. For instance, it’s built with 1 GB of RAM to ensure fast and smooth operation without lag. It’s also built with the Wear OS by Google, so it supports Google Assistant and allows you to benefit from:


Voice call functionality
Sleep and heart rate tracking
Hundreds of apps between iOS and Android app stores
A ton of fitness measuring functions, including how many calories you burn, how fast you run, GPS tracking, and more
Phone calls – you can place and accept calls depending on your situation
An ambient light sensor
Music playback
SMS, call, and other app notifications and reminders
Quick reply functionality if you pair the watch to an Android device


Ultimately, there’s a ton of value contained in this small device. It’s not even excessively heavy (though the watch face is a bit thicker than many of the others I’ve showcased so far). The band is made of rugged silicone, and the rest of the watch is durable and waterproof. The watch even comes with a 12-month manufacturer warranty and a 30-day moneyback guarantee. 


However, I 
did
 notice a striking downside in that the Bluetooth connectivity tends to quit if you had to go to another room or separate your watch and phone for longer than a couple of minutes. You’ll likely have to re-pair your phone and the watch over and over. Even so, I’d heartily recommend this watch for fitness enthusiasts or folks who want advanced devices that they can rely on over a long time.  


 
 
Pros
 




 Offers two modes of operation due to dual-layered screens. The former allows for battery life for up to a month


 Regular battery life is also quite good at between two and five days


 Works with Wear OS and Google Assistant, and includes all the associated apps and functions


 Good GPS tracking overall, plus good phone call quality


 Offers good durability, weatherproofing, and warranty for any manufacturer defects




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 The Bluetooth connectivity can be spotty depending on where you walk and the distance between your wrist and your phone

In my eyes, a great Android smartwatch should be sleek and slim to reflect the utility of the overall device. It’s not usually worthwhile to get a gaudy, heavy, or overly designed piece of hardware. That style is better suited to simple timepieces that you wear more for the way they accentuate your outfit or ensemble.


The Skagen Falster 3 is perhaps the best-looking Android smartwatch that I found in my search. But remember that this is ultimately a subjective measure, and what I think looks good could differ significantly from your own opinion.


The Skagen Falster 3 is minimalist and all-black by default, although it comes in eight styles in total. Regardless, each smartwatch is designed with band interchangeability, so you can quickly swap the style of your smartwatch if you purchase additional bands on the manufacturer’s website. But the exterior isn’t the only worthwhile part of this smartwatch.


For instance, it’s powered by Wear OS and works with both Android and iPhone smartphones. This, accordingly, comes with all of the bells and whistles you’d expect, including heart rate and activity tracking features from Google Fit, plus high-tech built-in GPS to track your distance traveled and other metrics. It’s also a great watch for swimming since it’s essentially waterproof down to 50 m.


It’s also one of the most rapid response smartwatches on the market, featuring 4 GB of storage and 1 GB of RAM. You’ll be able to download practically any third-party app and use it instantaneously. The watch is also built with Google Assistant by default, so it works well for receiving and making calls using the onboard speaker and microphone. You can also play music and customize your interface to your heart’s content.


An additional magnetic USB rapid charger is included, allowing you to go from no power to full power in a little over an hour. In my opinion, the hardware could use a little work even if the integrated software is everything you could want. There are some finicky parts and sometimes the watch fails to respond to physical button commands. Still, since it’s not overly expensive, it’s a great minimalist watch for those who like the style.


 
 
Pros
 




 Features a high-quality minimalist aesthetic in eight distinct styles


 Comes with Google Assistant and Google Fit, allowing all of the regular features and app access you’d expect


 Designed for use with heavy exercise, including waterproofing and a durable band (which can be interchanged)


 Battery life usually lasts for multiple days


 The watch is great when it comes to making and receiving calls and receiving text message alerts




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 The watch’s hardware buttons on the side sometimes give you trouble

Some smartwatches are designed for fitness fanatics from the ground up, while others only include fitness apps and functions as afterthoughts. The Fitbit Versa 3 is one of the former, and I was easily able to tell just from a quick look at the watch and its included features.


For starters, the Versa 2 includes an enhanced heart rate monitoring app that allows you to track your heart rate consistently 24/7 without any hiccups, even if you take the watch into water or alternate between running and walking. It even features an “Active Zone” function that can monitor your resting heart rate to accurately gauge your exercise effort. The watch will physically buzz to make sure you step up your intensity appropriately.


It also comes with Amazon Alexa built in, affording you access to tons of excellent apps and features like weather apps, reminders, smart home appliance control, and much more. The watch can take voice commands, though the speaker is a little iffy at times depending on the background noise, and it also comes with excellent built-in GPS functionality.


But most importantly, the Versa 3 comes with a 90-day trial of Fitbit Premium, making it easily one of the best Android smartwatches for heavy exercisers. This gives you access to additional fitness tracking apps and timers. I found the trial helpful if not absolutely necessary, but others will undoubtedly feel differently.


Furthermore, this phone watch for Android allows you to store and play music pretty easily through both Pandora and Deezer, or control Spotify if you have the latter installed on your connected phone. Plus, the watch comes with six days of battery with a full charge 
and
 you can get a full day of charge in as little as 12 minutes when it’s plugged in.


What’s not to like? If you 
don’t
 keep Fitbit Premium, the watch becomes pretty easy to miss. There aren’t any features that distinctly set it apart from most others on the market, and it’s not the most affordable Android smartwatch, either. Still, I’d recommend checking it out if you do like to use smartwatches primarily as fitness accessories and think you’ll benefit from the included Fitbit Premium subscription.


 
 
Pros
 




 Comes with a 90-day trial of Fitbit Premium


 Has Amazon Alexa already built into the software, allowing extra functions like mobile pay and voice commands


 Has a lot of excellent fitness tracking features to track your sleep, heart rate, and GPS position


 Comes in a few good colors that work with most aesthetics


 Offers really good battery life of up to six days on average with a very fast turnaround charge time




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 The watch is a little pricey for its included features when you take away the Premium subscription

Last but not least, I have to point out this exceedingly affordable Android smartwatch for those on tight budgets. Granted, this smartwatch isn’t going to reinvent any wheels and won’t overly impress. But it can be a good pick if you want a smartwatch for its basic functions and conveniences and don’t care about getting a top Android smartwatch.


The Amazfit Bip, however, may have the best Android smartwatch battery life I’ve seen. Charge it for 2.5 hours and you’ll get over 30 days of battery life. This might even be the longest battery life in the industry (though I can’t check 
every
 smartwatch on the market at the moment!). It also comes with 10 separate sports modes to track different exercise activities, like cycling, yoga, and more. 


The built-in GPS is reasonably accurate and can help you track your steps each day, how many calories you burn, and your sleep quality. The heart rate monitor is also pretty decent. Both features are bolstered by the colorful display that’s among the easiest to read when you’re outside. Take note, however, that this is a relatively limited smartwatch in that you need Android 5.0 or iOS 10.0 or above to sync it to your smartphone.


Again, the downside is the watch’s relatively limited design options and general cheapness. While it’s ostensibly waterproof, it’s definitely not as airtight as other models. It’s also not as durable overall, and each watch only comes with relatively simplistic band options. Still, this could be a good choice if you don’t mind going cheap for something basic.


 
 
Pros
 




 Very affordable, even compared to the other smartwatches on this list


 Comes with really good battery life – surprising given the asking price


 Comes with a 30-day refund and a 12-month replacement warranty


 Offers a really bright display, even when you’re in bright daytime light




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Limited to relatively recent smartphone devices for linking


 Doesn’t have as stylish aesthetic options


 Not as durable as many other smartwatches




 
 
 


Methodology


The thing about most smartwatches is that you can’t really tell whether they’re a good buy unless you give them a try. So I did! After all, you wouldn’t want to try out a new smartphone if the guy recommending it hadn’t given it a shot personally, right?


This took a little finagling, but through some offers to manufacturers for an unbiased review of their Android smartwatches, and by looting the wrists of some of my fellow staffers here, I was able to get my hands on all of the above smartwatches for an in-depth look. With the latter sources, I was also able to get some hands-on information about what the watches were good for and if there were any real downsides (which is how I learned about some of the above cons in terms of functionality or hardware deficiencies).


After collecting a bunch of notes and writing down bullet points, I sat down to write the review. After getting to the end of the smartwatch comparison, I ultimately bought and kept the smartwatch that I liked more than any of the others. What can I say? I’m a sucker for slick devices that offer tangible benefits to my daily life. Plus, maybe this will motivate me to head to the gym a little more often and start tracking my fitness goals.


Buyer’s Guide


How exactly did I break down the best Android smartwatches from the dozens (maybe even hundreds) on the market right now? Let me show you a buyer’s guide you can use to determine the rough value of a new Android smartwatch and help determine whether it’s a good pick for your needs.


Bluetooth Functionality




First off, all smartwatches will have some measure of Bluetooth compatibility. What I mean by this category is how well that Bluetooth functionality works out. Some smartwatches can’t maintain a Bluetooth connection past 10 feet, while others can easily go upwards of 30 feet while maintaining a crystal-clear connection for music or phone call playback purposes.


Obviously, more range is usually better, especially since it means that the watch’s connection to your Bluetooth enabled device will be steadier and more consistent, reducing lag across the board.


You should also look into how easy it is to re-pair a phone to a Bluetooth watch for Android in case the two devices get disconnected. Some smartwatches come with an automatic reconnection functionality, which is a nice boost to user convenience.


OS and Google Pixel Compatibility


Next, consider what operating systems or phone types a given smartwatch works with. Obviously, all of the above smartwatches will be compatible with Apple and Android devices (usually Android software at 5.0 or above is fine, though there are a few exceptions detailed in some of the smartwatch reviews). 


However, some can also work with iOS devices or with Google Pixel devices. Google Pixel devices aren’t as common as Android or iOS phones, but they come with additional features and compatibility bonuses if the smartwatch in question also has Google Assistant or Fit.


Some people like to collect devices from the same brand or manufacturer for improvements like this. The best smartwatches for Google Pixel phones will pair more quickly, benefit more broadly from Google Assistant voice commands, and ultimately have access to a few extra apps and control features.


Consider buying a smartwatch that works with Google Pixel if you already have some Google devices in your collection.


How’s the GPS on the Watch?




Most smartwatches also come with GPS navigation features, but the quality of those features can vary dramatically. In the worst cases, the “GPS” offered on a smartwatch barely qualifies and can’t be relied on to any meaningful degree.


Other smartwatches with GPS are so accurate that you can rely on them when navigating unfamiliar territory or hiking off-road. It all depends on the watch. I made sure to distinguish which smartwatches had great GPS functions in the above Android and Google smartwatch reviews.


Can the Watch Connect for Phone Calls?


While all smartwatches can connect to smartphones, only some of them will allow you to make and receive phone calls from the same paired device. This feature is hit or miss depending on the quality of the speaker and microphone attached to the smartwatch in question. A smartwatch that makes calls isn’t worth much if you can’t have a clear conversation with whoever you’re calling.


Still, this feature can be worthwhile if you get a smartphone that has both a great speaker and microphone and phone call functionality. It’s a good way to maintain a conversation while you’re working out or if you’re trying to hustle to work without having your phone in your hand. But it’s far from an absolutely necessary feature for most users.  


What Other Features Does the Smartwatch Have?


Lastly, be sure to do a thorough rundown of any other features or apps that a smartwatch might come with or offer. More smartwatch features are usually great, especially since extra apps or functions are paired with smartwatches with more RAM or better hardware to handle the extra 
computing
.


For example, advanced smartwatches might contain extra fitness apps for tracking dozens of different sports, or offer additional payment apps so you can go card-less when shopping. Other smartwatches might come with music playback features and apps – these are a particular focus of mine since most folks want to listen to music while they work out. Doing so wirelessly with a smartwatch and phone with a strong Bluetooth connection is easy and enjoyable.


Final Verdict


Bottom line: which Android smartwatch would 
I
 stick with if I had to choose?


I’m not normally about picking the most expensive option on the market. But in this case, the 
Samsung Galaxy 3 Smartwatch
 won me over in the end. There’s just too much that’s useful and fun about it for me to pass it up (which is why I ultimately ended up buying that one after trying the others).


Basically, it’s got it all – excellent compatibility with various smartphones and other devices, a great design, easy connectivity, and some of the best available fitness apps and other functionalities at my fingertips. While I do wish that I had a slightly better battery life compared to many competitors, it’s not an issue since I’m usually good about remembering to plug in my devices every night.


But that’s just my choice. You might very well choose something different based on your needs and your budget level. If you’re in doubt, remember what I went over in the buying guide to determine the best Android smartwatch for your unique needs.


FAQs


Q: What is the best smartwatch for Android phones?


A: In my opinion, the flat-out best Android-compatible smartwatch is the Samsung Galaxy 3 watch, which combines lots of innovative features with excellent design and durability (aside from relatively short battery life). But the best smartwatch for 
you
 depends on your budget level and the features you’re looking for.


For instance, do you want something more stylish and slick? Try the Skagen Falster 3. Or if you want something super affordable with most of the major features you can find in modern smartwatches, check out the Amazfit Bip.


Q: What can a smartwatch do?


A: Most smartwatches offer a host of similar features. Smartwatches are all usually based on tracking a few fitness or health-related metrics, but more advanced watches will include additional functions based on whether they have compatibility with Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and similar voice assistant features.


Some smartwatches can:


Allow you to pay for things remotely without a card
Make and accept phone calls when paired with a smartphone
Receive and respond to texts
Play games and media
Guide you through unfamiliar territory with GPS navigation
And more


Q: Do all smartwatches work with Google Pixel?


A: 
Most
 smartwatches are compatible with Google Pixel at this time, but not all. The fact is that Google Pixel is still not as common as either iOS or Android’s various operating systems, so smartphones are designed for those two options more frequently. Most of the smartwatches above do work with Google Pixel, and a great way to tell whether a watch is compatible or not is if it comes with Google Fit or Assistant by default.


Q: How do smartwatches check your heart rate?


A: The exact process might differ from watch to watch, but the basics are the same. Smartwatches with heart rate monitors feature a sensor on the bottom of the base that hovers over your wrist. This projects green light onto your skin. Since the green light isn’t absorbed by the tissue beneath your epidermis, it’s reflected back to the sensor. By measuring the variations in the green light, the smartwatch can calculate your heart rate with variable accuracy.


Q: Are smartwatches good for kids?


A: Letting kids use smartwatches, as with any smart device, comes with risks and rewards. Although many features are designed with adults in mind, the health tracking features that are prominent in smartwatches hold a lot of value. Knowing if our children are sleeping well, getting enough exercise, and have steady heart and breathing rates is a huge, even life saving, benefit.


On the other hand, as parents we need to be vigilant with smart devices and ensure that our children aren’t exposed to content they aren’t ready for or don’t understand. So, we need to be careful which devices we choose and what parental controls they have. Our list of recommended smartwatches for kids should help your buying decision if you choose to give your child a smartwatch.

"
The 10 Best Audiophile Headphones to Take Note of in 2022,https://10beasts.com/best-audiophile-headphones/,"



Here’s a reality of listening to music that I recently learned: a song is only as good as what you use to listen to it. Your favorite track could be a masterpiece of blended instruments, sound balancing, and vocals, but you won’t be able to enjoy it without good headphones.


I was content for too long to go with subpar or “okay” headphones and earbuds. I figured, foolishly, that there wasn’t much of a difference between them and the best audiophile headphones, and that stuff advertised to audiophiles was a waste of time and money.


Here’s another reality: 
I was wrong
.


See, I ended up listening to one of my favorite tracks (Katy Perry, guilty pleasure) on a friend’s pair of high-quality Bose headphones. I 
had no idea
 what I was missing. It turns out, I had been 
listening to my music
 without getting the full experience.


Driver quality, noise-cancellation, and comfort level can all dramatically affect whether you really get into your tunes or if you’re separated from the song. It’s like watching a movie in a theater compared to watching it on a corner screen at the dentist’s office.


I was hooked on audiophile-quality sound, so I went searching. In the end, I found several of the best audiophile headphones I had to share. Some of you may disagree with these headphones recommendations, and that’s fine. But ultimately, I think that audiophile headphones like the ones below have the power to really transform how you listen to music or enjoy games and movies.


I know these changed things for me! I guess I’m an audiophile now!

These days, everyone makes a big fuss about the new graphics in the latest video games. As a big gamer myself, I can relate. But I too rarely hear people talk about how much of a difference great sound makes for the best games on the market.


Truth is, great headphones can totally change your gaming experience – at least, it does for me! With that in mind, I have to say that the Beyerdynamic Amirons are the best headphones for gaming in 2022, and I think they’re great for both gamers and audiophiles alike.


Where to start? The headphones offer truly and deeply moving sound thanks to the top-tier Tesla-tech drivers and miniaturized equipment. Deep, precise basses, silky smooth highs, and full, natural mids are the rule, not the exception, meaning you’ll be able to hear every explosion or line of dialogue from a videogame many characters in fully realized audio enjoyment. Gaming soundtracks also sound fantastic on these things, too!


Voice coils made from copper rest at the heart of the headphones ensure that characters, music, and ambient background noise all come through naturally and don’t overwhelm one another.


But more interesting (and innovative, in my opinion) is the MOSAYC sound personalization app. This can be downloaded to any iOS or Android device. Once you apply the sound profile, you can fine-tune what the Beyerdynamic Amirons provide whenever you sit down to game.


Being totally wireless headphones, you’d think that some sound quality might be lost, but not here. Audiophiles will be able to quickly recognize the sheer excellence of these headphones’ design, especially since they feature integrated Qualcomm aptX HD chips.


So the headphones sound great, certainly. But I was also really impressed with how comfortable the headphones were. Their cups are comfortable and wrap easily around your ear – the only downside is that they become hot relatively quickly. Still, I like the comfortable band (no headaches from long listening sessions) and the easy controls. You can switch the headphones on and off with a single button, and a touchpad on the earcup lets you control calls or other media playback settings like volume.


And all this hasn’t even touched on the phenomenal aesthetic. Talk about gorgeous! These Bluetooth headphones feature copper trimming (harkening back to the copper coils inside the headphones), and a dark color that’s sure to be at home in any man’s bachelor pad. Because we all know that your headphones are only worthwhile if they look as cool as they sound, right?


Ultimately, these are the best audiophile headphones for gaming. But they’re also great for general headphone and audio enthusiasts everywhere. They’re not even the priciest headphones on my list, so consider getting yourself a pair.


 
 
Pros
 




 You can personalize the audio feedback using the app


 Very easy to control with a single switch, the wireless app or the earcup controls


 Earcups are pretty comfortable overall, provided your ears fit


 Top-quality battery life considering the audio power these undoubtedly draw


 I really like the aesthetic, so add a few style points




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 The earcups are one-size-fits-all, unfortunately


 Also, the earcups can quickly become too hot for comfort

For a headphone enthusiast, what really makes audiophile headphones work is how well they cancel out sound from the outside world. I admit that even I like to retreat into my own happy space now and then, and high-quality sound-canceling headphones can be great study aids when you want to dig deep into a textbook. Fortunately, I found the Bose headphones above to be some of the best high end wireless audiophile headphones.


It’s no surprise, either, given Bose’s reputation as one of the best over ear headphone manufacturers in the business.


But let’s get technical. Ultimately, these Bose headphones offer up to 11 levels of noise-canceling control. That means you don’t have to totally mute your environment – you can just take the edge off if you want to remain aware of your surroundings. One thing I noticed was that this was advantageous when traveling. I could use these headphones when catching the train and not have to worry about running into someone because I couldn’t hear them at my side.


But I also liked how well-optimized headphones were for wireless assistance and control. Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant both work (I prefer Google Assistant). You can access the former by using a wake-up word programmed into the headphones by default or by pushing a physical button.


Speaking of wireless connectivity, the headphones can work for up to 20 hours with a single charge. There’s definitely better battery life offered by other headphones, and it sharply drops if you use some of the higher levels of noise-cancellation. But it’s also nothing to sneeze at. More importantly, the wireless connectivity lets you play music from your phone without having a cord get in the way of your movement.


I checked the integrated microphone system to get a sense of everything these headphones could really bring to the table. Turns out, it’s great! These are excellent headphones for calling and for hearing other people when making a call.


In terms of comfort, the headphones are middling. You see, the earcups are angled so they should fit pretty much everyone without much adjustment. But the stainless steel headband certainly isn’t that cushy on the top of your head. This means you may need to remove the headphones from time to time to massage your scalp.


Still, even with that caveat, these are undoubtedly the best noise-canceling headphones for 2022, especially for students who want to hunker down and focus on their studies without being distracted.


 
 
Pros
 




 Lots of control over the noise-cancellation feature


 Easy to connect to wireless smart assistance


 Earcups can angle, and I like that since it means your ears won’t feel compressed or crushed as easily


 Great connectivity range – in my experiments, I found it could connect up to 15 m away from a signaling device


 I also really like the voice pick up, so you won’t have to over enunciate if you use these headphones for calls




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Headband isn’t very comfortable and can actually make your head ache after a little while


 Battery life goes down below 10 hours if you use the highest noise-cancellation setting possible

Okay, I admit, I 
didn’t
 buy these… but I did try them out for three hours with a friend at an audio equipment shop I know. I didn’t buy these personally because they’re quite pricy. With that in mind… I would recommend them for select audiophiles if price is absolutely no object.


I would do that because the sound you get with these headphones is out of this world, full-stop. Play a song on these headphones and you’ll hear every note in the mix, even at very high and low frequencies. Even more impressively, the drivers and chips inside each earcup work together to make sure that the tonal balance is never disturbed. For the uninitiated, this just means that the bass sounds aren’t lost when high sounds peak, and vice versa.


With the closed back headphone design it’s more possible than with any other audiophile headphone set to immerse yourself in your favorite music. The electrodynamic speaker drivers work well even with really complex melodies and tracks.


But these premium headphones are also great because they’re 
comfortable
. In fact, the comfort alone is enough to make me wonder if that price tag isn’t warranted in the end!


Comfortable earcups and a padded headband combine to ensure a comfortable experience even if you wear these headphones for hours on end without stopping. The earpads inside the cups are even bolstered with memory foam which helps with sound isolation. The more you use them, the more comfortable they should become. The headband features lambskin leather – talk about 
fancy
.


Plus, the headphones come in a classy carrying case for storage and protection. After all, you don’t want these treasured headphones to get damaged!


Note that these headphones are wired, which may be a downside if you’re in the mood more for portable audio luxury. However, I believe you don’t get as high audio quality without using a cord, at least with today’s tech.


Have some cash to spare? These are some of the best over the ear headphones I’ve ever seen and are a treat for any audiophile.


 
 
Pros
 




 This features arguably the best sound you’ll ever get in a pair of headphones, bar none


 Super comfortable, partly because of the excellent materials used for both the earcups and the headband


 Pretty tough, but it also comes with a carrying case you can use to make sure no one steals these


 Cable provided is one of the most durable for headphones and goes up to 3 m, affording a good amount of room to maneuver


 Case comes with a magnetic locking system – again, this makes the headphones hard to break, even in transit




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Corded, which may impact how and where you can use them


 Some may say these are a premium headphone set, others may say they’re just very, very, very expensive

There are different headphones made for different uses. What distinguishes different headphones for those uses lies in the audio chips and the style of the ‘phones themselves. For instance, a gaming headset (like I already went over above) focuses more on user comfort and bass sounds since there’s usually a lot of explosions.


Music-focused headphones will be more balanced, and that’s exactly what the HIFIMAN Ananda’s bring to the table. Hovering at about the middle of the pack in terms of price, these headphones are perfect for high-sensitivity audiophiles who know exactly what to listen for when jamming to their favorite tunes or delving deep into their favorite artists’ albums.


Indeed, the headphones have a frequency response of 8 Hz to 55 kHz. In a nutshell, this just means they can accurately replicate highs to basses without losing a single bit of auditory information or letting any part of the range overwhelm the other.


Inside the earcups of these 
planar magnetic headphones
, the super-thin diaphragm (the layer of material between the drivers and your ears) adds to this effect. It’s just 1-2 microns thick. Let me assure you, you can 
hear
 the difference when there isn’t felt, leather, or some other material between your ears and your music’s source.


But they’re also pretty stylish and comfortable, all things considered. For instance, they weigh less than a pound (just 14.07 ounces) and feature thin, tall earcups that should fit most users without any adjustment. The grill design on the outside of the earcups is hit or miss. It’s not my favorite, personally, but that’s not really a con since that aspect is totally subjective.


I found I could connect these headphones to any smartphone or portable tablet without any lag or drop in audio quality. This is, of course, largely thanks to the corded design instead of relying on the inherent risk of wireless connections.


All in all, they’re the best over ear headphones for high-quality music listening I could find, even if they weren’t the most expensive. 


 
 
Pros
 




 Passive soundstage is phenomenal, especially since the diaphragm between your ears and the speakers is super-thin on either side


 Generally comfortable thanks to the shape of the earcups
 
 However, the headband’s layer is so thin that if your head is big you might get uncomfortable over time


 Cable connectivity ensures excellent music playback without stuttering or lag


 Lightweight, shouldn’t weigh down on your head too much




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 As mentioned, they won’t quite fit everyone’s head shape, so your mileage may vary on this point


 An odd con, but I have to mention – the earcups swivel a little too enthusiastically. This can make setting them on your ears tricky sometimes

I know, I know… really, Edward? You want to recommend 
earbuds
 for audiophiles? Hear me out (pun intended).


The thing is, most people think of headphones as the premier high-quality audio solution, usually because they can have larger speakers, more and better drivers, and overall enclose your ear to block out intruding sound. But earbuds can still be great picks, especially if you’re on a budget and if you like to listen to high-quality music on the go without totally closing yourself off from the outside world.


It’s here that the Jabra Elite 75ts excel. For starters, these earbuds are extremely comfortable when you fit them into your ear. This is a big deal for me since lots of other cheap earbuds feel like the uncomfortable, cheap plastic they actually are within 15 minutes.


These buds are different. They feature a small and sleek design that can fit most ear shapes without much effort. They don’t have multiple ear tips like cheaper earbuds often do, but I honestly don’t think you’ll need them. 


More importantly, these buds can wirelessly connect to any music playing device like an iPhone or tablet without any dropout or connectivity issues. Fourth-generation, true wireless connectivity means any calls and all music playback should be stable. It certainly was in my experience.


The sound on display is also relatively high quality. It’s no full-on wireless headphone experience, to be sure, but it’s a far cry from the tinny, unrewarding sound offered by most competitors. 4 microphones work in conjunction to ensure that all phone calls are clear and crisp, and work to filter out wind and similar noises from the background.


You also get a little under eight hours on a full charge. But the buds come with a charging case that can store another 28 hours of power. It shouldn’t be too much trouble to always have the buds ready to go, therefore, and the case provides a convenient storage solution anyway.


Also, the buds are weatherproof. Their water-resistant bodies can also repel dust, making them great for exercise. Add to that the proprietary app you can connect them to and you’ve got arguably the best wireless earbuds for audiophiles on the market. The app is a really nice touch if you like to personalize your listening experience like I do.


Again, it’s not about beating headphones in terms of raw sound quality. These buds are about offering portable and comfortable high-quality audio on the go without the bulk and cable connectivity required by so many other top-tier headphones. If that sounds attractive to you, give these a shot. If it helps, think of them as some of the best 
in-ear 
headphones. 


 
 
Pros
 




 Decent battery life through and through when you consider the charge from the included carrying case


 These are rated for inclement weather, so dust, fog, and rain shouldn’t have any effect on their activity. They make for some of the best workout headphones around


 Good connectivity overall, especially when you pair them initially. I didn’t have trouble when I left my phone in another room, for example


 Very comfortable in the ear, even though there aren’t adjustable tips to utilize


 There’s an app you can download for any mobile device that allows you to customize your sound settings and control the buds with greater specificity than you might expect




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Alone, the buds don’t have nearly as much battery life as wireless headphones. Keep this in mind if you frequently misplace your devices

Earlier I talked about how different headphones are designed to prioritize different types of sound. But what about headphones that focus on making an open and spacious 
soundstage
? With those headphones, you could use them interchangeably for gaming, movies, music, phone calls…


Enter the best audio quality headphones: the Sennheiser HD 800 S. The successor to the magnificent Sennheiser HD600, these were certainly some of the best I had the pleasure of listening to when researching for this guide. These dynamic headphones feature some of the largest drivers in their class, reaching 56 mm in diameter. For comparison, most other headphone drivers are around 30-40 mm.


Ultimately, this results in phenomenal sound across the board. Music, movies, and games all sound fully realized just as their artists intended them to be. This is all bolstered by the wired nature of the headphones and the use of German materials. Ever heard of the merits of German engineering? It’s on full display with these devices.


But they’re top-tier in terms of sound reproduction for more reasons than just the driver size and materials. The open back headphone design helps to funnel soundwaves deeper into your ear. This does mean there’s a real danger of blasting out your eardrums if you listen to your music too loudly. But it’s an acceptable trade-off in my experience!


The headphones are also excellent since they come with vibration dampening materials around the ears and headband, both of which are padded for comfort. As a bonus, this makes the sound even better 
again
 since it means certain lower sounds aren’t drowned out by their higher counterparts.


I really like the semi-industrial aesthetic. These aren’t as sleek as some of the other headphones on the market, but they’ll be a favorite for many just because of how techy and audiophilic they look. The headphones come with the cables you need to connect both to audio devices and a headphone amplifier (a 
headphone amp
 increases the power to your headphones more than what the output of most phones and audio devices can manage): a perfect pick for mixing your own music in your studio.


All in all, I’d rank these highly if you want top-tier audio quality for 
all
 kinds of media enjoyment instead of specializing in one or the other.


 
 
Pros
 




 The headphones are made with aerospace-grade materials – literally, that means they’re light enough and tough enough to be used in aerospace projects


 I really like the aesthetic, which combines class with industrial practicality


 Comes with the wires necessary for headphone amplifiers, which not all corded headphones include


 Generally pretty comfortable for both the ears and headband region




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 The headband isn’t as flexible or stretchable as many other headphones on the market, which surprised me. Those with bigger heads may feel that the headphones are a little tight


 A minor nitpick, but the headphone cables are a bit easy to bend or kink. Be sure to store them carefully if you buy these

Sony has a big reputation in the electronics industry, but they’re not exactly industry leaders. So it was with some trepidation that I tried out these headphones, expecting them to be decent but not truly ideal for audiophiles.


I was wrong. These combine Sony’s technological expertise with electronics with smart manufacturing in more ways than one. For instance, the headphones feature a smart-listening “Sense Engine”: in brief, this tech helps the headphones to reproduce sound in the most optimal way possible based on your ambient environment and the songs being played.


40 mm liquid crystal polymer drivers add to the overall reproduction efficacy. The resulting musical quality is pretty top-notch, even if it doesn’t quite reach the levels of some of the other headphones on my list.


But these stereo headphones are valuable for more than just their sound reproduction quality. For example, they come with excellent noise-canceling tech (which is to be expected from Sony). While this noise-canceling setting can’t be fine-tuned quite as well as the Bose version described earlier, it’s still great for drowning out annoying sound and totally immersing yourself in your favorite music.


It’s also helpful when you make calls using the headphones. Since they can operate as wired/wireless headphones depending on your needs, you can easily use these to communicate with your friends or make a work call, then go back to listening to your music seamlessly without having to take them off your ears.


In fact, Sony integrated a special “quick attention” mode directly into the headphones’ software to facilitate this type of interaction. Take a call, have a conversation, use the noise-canceling tech to ensure there isn’t any background chatter, then go back to your music all within seconds through this seamless shifting.


These lightweight, noise-canceling headphones operate more powerfully and innovatively than I originally expected. Plus, they’re overall pretty affordable, especially compared to some of the pricier choices I’ve gone over so far. My advice? Check these out if you’re in the mood for something portable, easy to use for calls, and that provides good sound quality and noise-canceling in a single package.


 
 
Pros
 




 The battery life is really great for a dual wired/wireless set of headphones. They average around 25 hours with a full battery, but the fact that you can just plug them in to keep listening means you should never really be without these headphones in a pinch


 Again, the ability to seamlessly switch from music to calls and back again is excellent and very user-friendly


 Effective noise-cancellation, but not very modifiable


 The Sense Engine works in the background but I felt that I noticed it with particularly complex tracks and songs with multiple layers, as nothing felt really drowned out.




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 The earcups are decently comfortable but quickly warm-up past the point of comfort if you are walking. These definitely aren’t the best over ear headphones for the gym


 Noise-cancellation quickly drains the battery, so I’d recommend using that function while the headphones are plugged in if possible

Many audiophiles couldn’t care less about wireless connectivity, and some would argue rightly so. After all, wired headphones will almost always be able to provide the best sound relative to their wireless counterparts just because of the stability of the connection and a wire’s ability to translate more audio information without any bit loss.


In my mind, the V-MODA M-200s are the best of the best when it comes to wired headphones, even if there are tons of pricier versions on the market. But cost doesn’t always translate directly to quality.


For instance, these headphones feature 50 mm drivers – those are relatively huge, and they facilitate fantastic audio replication across the entire sound spectrum. But those are also made with special “neodymium” magnets, plus specialized voice coils that really make singers in various tracts pop without any part of a given song feeling overwhelmed or drowned out.


That same attention to audio quality is replicated when it comes time to make phone calls. I found that it was really easy to both place and take calls using the designated button, which automatically engages the in-built microphone. Call quality is crystal-clear, especially since you can connect the headphones to your wireless device using the included cables.


What about comfort? Here’s a small downside: that the earcups aren’t super comfortable, though the headband is oddly fine. That’s likely because the headphones overall are quite lightweight and you can adjust the tension in the headband easily. Both components use sweat-resistant PU-leather, which I do like even if it isn’t the coolest material they could have used.


But the earcups do benefit from memory foam cushions, so they become more comfortable the longer you use them. A flat-folding hinge allows you to store the headphones either in the included case or anywhere that’s convenient.


These sweatproof over ear headphones come with 3.5 mm stereo cables perfect for facilitating studio-quality sound mixing and listening. Ultimately, there are few headphones that do as good a job at transmitting sound straight from a device or instrument without losing anything in the translation as these.


 
 
Pros
 




 I can’t stress it enough – the sound quality is off the charts, especially if you plug these straight into your instrument or mixing computer


 The earcups and headband can be decently maneuvered and adjusted, which means these are good for a wide variety of head shapes and storage solutions


 The set does come with a carrying case and an extra cable, which I appreciate


 It’s really easy to take and make phone calls using the preprogrammed button on the earcup




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 The earcups can get really hot after a while, even if the material is supposedly sweat resistant




 
 
 


Honorable Mention: 
Philips Audio SHP9500 Headphones


These headphones are pretty similar to the V-MODA M-200s, only for a much lower asking price. But you still get 50 mm drivers to deliver a full spectrum of sound replication and a very spacious soundstage that’s unmatched by far too many pricier headphone options.


On top of that, the SHP9500s come with 1.5 m of cable length: more than enough, for me at least, for wandering around a studio or listening to music while working. On top of the cable length and sound quality, these headphones come with ancillary benefits, like a comfortable and double layered cushion on the headband for added comfort, breathable ear cushions, and specially angled drivers.


What marks this as audiophile-quality, you ask? Check out the gold-plated adapter cables that are sure to help you maximize your listening enjoyment while plugged into studio-quality equipment.

Can you marry budget and quality? I happen to think so, and I think that the EarFun Wireless Earbuds ended up surprising me as they demonstrated it. Yes, earbuds again! As before, hear me out.


The EarFun Wireless Earbuds are super affordable, but that doesn’t mean they skimp on audio quality the way you might think. That’s partially because they utilize dual graphing speakers (one in each bud) to produce improved bass performance and really clear trebles making for a very balanced 
sound signature
.


The result is that there 
is
, admittedly, a little bit of tinniness with some of the ultrahigh sounds you get with pop songs. But that tinniness shouldn’t be enough to take away from your enjoyment of your music if you’re looking for some of the best budget audiophile headphones, anyway.


I also really like these since they come with noise-cancellation microphones, which you can engage with a voice command or with your phone. This doubles the efficacy of the inbuilt sound replication, though be aware that it does drain the batteries extremely fast.


Speaking of batteries, these buds can run for up to six hours on a single charge, and the included jumbo charging case carries another 24 hours of battery life. That’s certainly not the best I saw in my search for the best audiophile headphones, but it’s enough for casual use or for those who are sticklers about recharging their buds after every outing.


Fortunately, the buds benefit from offering a 10-minute charging cycle that, after completion, results in two hours of listening time. So these are actually pretty good if you forgot to charge them the night before but still want to take them with you for your run outside.


The charging case is pretty cool, too. It features indicator lights on the outside so you can quickly see, at a glance, whether your buds are ready to go or if you need to give them more time to charge.


The EarFun Wireless Earbuds are really easy to connect to a variety of wireless devices, and they work up to a whopping 15 m away. I’d even go so far as to say they’re the best set of noise-canceling true wireless earbuds of 2022, all for a cheap price!


In the end, these certainly aren’t the best of the best when it comes to pure audio quality. But they do a phenomenal job of offering a decent audio experience on the go and without having to totally empty your wallet.


 
 
Pros
 




 Very fast charging cycle available if you forget to charge them


 I like the charging case both for the indicator lights and for how snugly the buds fit inside


 The buds connect very quickly to any previously paired device, indicating excellent memory


 Noise-cancelation is quite powerful for being stored in these small buds


 Bass sounds are really good here


 Honestly some of the best cheap headphones out there for their balance of quality and price




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 On the flip side, higher sounds suffer a bit compared to many of the other headphones on this list


 As mentioned, battery life drops to about two hours if you use noise-cancellation




 
 
 


Honorable Mention: 
GRADO SR80e Prestige Series Wired Headphones


For the price, these are phenomenal picks. They serve as an alternative pair of great value audiophile headphones if you don’t like earbuds. Featuring an open back design and a great aesthetic that should look right at home in any studio environment, these headphones are lightweight and exceedingly comfortable, even by my high standards.


On top of that, they come with a miniature plug and a standard 1/4
th
” adapter for ease of use and versatility. Improved bass residence, vented diaphragms for better sound transmission, and copper cords all add up to a decent piece of equipment you can get without completely breaking the bank.


Even better is the 1-year US warranty that covers manufacturer defects. For peace of mind, you can’t do much better than these top open back headphones.

You’ve probably seen that I don’t like headphones that are too uncomfortable for listening over long sessions. The Anker Soundcore Life Q20s seem tailor-made to alleviate that issue. That’s partially because of the special protein leather they use for their earcups. Far from the sweat-inducing stuff seen earlier, these earcups don’t become too sweaty for comfort, even if it’s hot around you.


The earcups also come with memory foam toward the pads and around the rim. I found the headphones became more comfortable as I wore them over time, which is always a plus in my book. The earcups feature rotating joints so you can easily adjust their angle, too.


The headband isn’t padded, but that doesn’t detract from comfort as much as you might think since the headphones overall are only a little over .5 pounds. The headband didn’t weigh down on the top of my head at all, which I really enjoyed.


But comfort is only one part of determining whether a set of headphones is worth your time. Thankfully, these do a good job of bringing high-quality sound to the table thanks to their custom 40 mm dynamic drivers. Since they can replicate extended frequencies, both very high, er, 
highs
 and lower bass sounds are represented equally well.


As a bonus, these headphones come with active noise-cancellation tech, produced by four simultaneous microphones. A special ANC algorithm built into the headphones’ software can easily detect and then cancel out ambient noise in the background, making these some of the best headphones for airplane use, too. Comfort and quiet on an airplane? Sounds like a great combination to me.


As wireless dynamic driver headphones, these also do a really good job with battery life, offering up to 40 hours in total even 
with
 noise-cancellation engaged. Turn noise-cancellation off and this goes up to 60 hours! Like the earbuds before, these also feature a fast-charging cycle where you can plug them in for five minutes and get a couple of hours of battery life if you’re in a rush.


Did I mention how affordable these were? Honestly, they’re a dark horse pick that I feel has been ignored by almost everyone else in favor of pricier picks. Check these out if you want some of the best budget audiophile headphones that also doesn’t compromise on sound quality!


 
 
Pros
 




 Great bass sounds in particular, although no frequency group is especially left out or ignored in favor of the others


 Earcups are some of the most comfortable on the market, and they become more comfortable over time


 The headphones are really lightweight and flexible, so they should fit most people


 Comes with decent noise-cancellation tech, though you can’t adjust its levels


 Possibly the highest battery life I saw in my search, even with noise-cancellation tech engaged




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Phone call quality wasn’t the greatest, at least on my end


 Noise-cancellation does filter out certain higher really low sounds, unfortunately, so they’re not the best for noise-canceling in busier environments




 
 
 


Honorable Mention: 
Meze 99 Classics Over-Ear Headphones


I also found these headphones from Meze, which almost took the spot for the most comfortable headphones for audiophiles. As closed-back headphones, these top-tier devices can completely immerse you in your favorite sounds and exceptional physical comfort at the same time. And you won’t bug those around you as these have insanely little sound leakage. 


A self-adjusting, PU-leather headband adequately spreads the weight of both earcups out so the top of your skull never feels achy or sore. 


The earcups themselves are made with the same PU-leather, plus memory foam on the inside to both increase passive noise isolation and boost your comfort over time. Check out the 
real wood
 earcups, too – the 99 Classics get a definite boost to style points there.


There’s a lot else to like as well, including a hard carrying pouch, plenty of cable length, a detachable USB microphone and remote, and airplane jack adapter, and excellent sound replication capabilities. Beyond just being an alternative for one of the best headphones on the market for comfort’s sake, the 99 Classics are a solid choice all around, too.


Methodology


Full disclosure – I don’t own all of these headphones.


But that makes sense! Some of the headphones above really have astronomical prices. You’d need to be a famous DJ or artist to justify spending that kind of cash on what amounts to a luxury item. Even new converts like myself that really 
get
 the difference that it makes to have high-quality headphones can’t justify spending too much money, especially when I needed to try all these headphones out. 


So instead I contacted friends who had them or, in the case of the really pricy ones, got a trial run from the store when I asked. It wasn’t as in-depth an experience as I was able to get with the headphones and earbuds I did buy or try for extended periods, but I learned enough to have a solid grasp of what they offered and how they sounded.


After compiling notes and summarizing some of the gut feelings I had, I wrote this high end headphones review. It was fun enough that, to be honest, I’ll probably do it again when new audiophile headphones come out!


Buyer’s Guide


My advice is great and all, but it’s based on my subjective experience! You’re probably wondering, “How do I choose the best headphones for me?”


The good news is there are a few things you can prioritize to make sure you grab some great ‘phones or ‘buds that are 
perfect
 for you, not just the best in their category.


Sound Quality – How to Tell What Headphones Have the Best Sound?


First and foremost, the best headphones for audiophiles should 
sound
 phenomenal… right? I don’t make headphones and so don’t know all of the exact specifics or technical terms that sound mixers might be able to explain by heart. When I was listening to different headphones, I focused on a few key things:


Frequency range
Sound balance
Bass and high representation


The first factor essentially describes how good the headphones are at reproducing sounds from the low end of the spectrum (bass sounds) to the high end (many female voices, higher instruments, etc.). The wider the frequency, the greater the sound replication accuracy and the more dynamic the resulting sound should end up.


When I listened for sound balance, I tried to discern whether a given pair of headphones overrepresented certain sounds on the frequency or allowed certain sounds to dominate the song. For instance, some drivers naturally favor bass sounds, so songs with a lot of high notes or voices suffer. The reverse is true for headphones with drivers that prioritize highs and mids over bass.


Well-balanced headphones more often produce top-tier sound across the board.


I also listened specifically for bass and high reproduction and representation, since those two sounds are most often ignored in favor of the middle of the sound spectrum.


What Materials Should Headphones Have?




Materials were a place where I became a stickler for certain things, mostly because it determines your overall comfort when you wear a pair of wired and over ear headphones. Headphones with PU leather and certain types of mesh fabric tend to be a little more comfortable than those with hotter leather or just plain plastic.


Over time, those latter materials can really do a number on your ears and the top of your head, especially if you listen to music on the headphones for hours on end.


But you should also consider the materials of the overall chassis and the drivers on the inside. Neodymium magnets and drivers are particularly good choices if you want to prioritize quality over budget. Some earcups might be made with special polymers or even real wood for added aesthetic value.


What about mesh? Mesh is budget-friendly and can be comfortable, but it’s not super durable compared to the other options. My advice would be not to cross mesh off entirely but be aware that it, out of the other materials, has the potential to shred and fray faster than you may like. 


Are a Pair of Headphones Wired or Wireless?


You should absolutely consider whether a given pair of headphones can play wirelessly or must be attached via cable to an audio device. Both sides have their pros and cons.


Wireless headphones:


Can be taken with you on the go more easily since you don’t need to wrestle a cable back and forth as you walk
Are oftentimes smaller and lighter, which may contribute to comfort
Are easier to connect to wireless devices, oftentimes via voice commands or through automatic memory pairing


Wired headphones:


Usually edge out in front of their wireless counterparts in terms of total sound quality. That’s because wires can transmit more sound information without bit loss to headphones’ drivers
Never run the risk of running out of battery
Sometimes feature classier or more expensive interior materials, which may make for a more comfortable headband or earcups


Which should you pick? It depends on your focus. If you want the absolute best sound reproduction you can get, wired headphone options are the way to go. In my opinion, everyone else won’t care or won’t be able to tell the difference between wired and wireless headphones, so wireless headphones might be the way to go for sheer convenience.


On the other hand, wired headphones might be the pick for you if you can never remember to plug in your wireless headphones at the end of the day!


If They’re Wireless, What Are the Headphones’ Battery Life?


If you do decide to go with wireless headphones, be sure to consider the overall battery life they offer. Earbuds split their battery life between the miniature batteries embedded in each bud and a larger battery inside the charging case that should, more often than not, just remain plugged in for convenience.


Either way, battery life tells you how long you have before you need to plug your headphones or earbuds in to keep listening. Longer battery life is obviously better, and it’s also better for combining with headphones with noise-cancellation tech. Noise-cancellation microphones often draw tons of power from the battery, cutting your overall battery life in half.


Final Verdict


When push comes to shove, which would 
I
 take with me onto a desert island?


I have to admit that the 
HIFIMAN Ananda Over-Ear Full-Size Magnetic Headphones 
really won me over in the end. Granted, they’re not the 
best
 for all head shapes, but they fit me just fine! On top of that, they’re supremely comfortable and don’t even weight a whole pound. 


But they’re true audiophile headphones because of their unparalleled sound quality, super-thin diaphragms, amazing drivers. It’s hard to put into words exactly how they made me feel, but let me put it this way: I don’t use any other headphones when I want to sink into sound and just 
become
 a song.


Poetic? A little. But I think anyone who gives these a shot will be far from disappointed and they’re my pick for the best overall audiophile headphones.


FAQs


Q: Are high-end headphones worth it?


A: As I’ve already given away, I’d say yes. But in truth, it depends on what you’re looking for in headphones and how much of a value you put on a top-tier audio experience. Basically, the best headphone brands and their offerings are great if you like to get everything you can out of a song or media experience.


But if music isn’t a passion, then high-end over ear headphones may be a waste of time and money. You have a vast choice of headphones from across the market and a variety of pricing points – go with what seems to be a good balance for price and quality.


Q: Are expensive headphones worth it?


A: If you have the cash 
and
 are passionate about getting the best audio experience possible, 
sometimes
. As I hopefully showed above, some of the highest rated headphones are well worth your time and money even if they aren’t the most expensive on the market. Price doesn’t always reflect quality (though there is a strong correlation).


Q: Do headphones sound better than earbuds?


A: Honestly… yes, in most cases. The fact of the matter is that headphones can utilize bigger drivers and more sophisticated audio equipment since they’re larger. Earbuds are much more limited by their size and battery life. Plus, headphones often wrap around your ear to get rid of background noise.


Q: Do you need surround sound?


A: With headphones that advertise surround sound software, the manufacturer is essentially saying that the headphones can mimic the effect of having multiple speakers around your ears. For songs and general artist playback, it’s not really necessary. But gamers might appreciate it since surround sound software can result in better directional recognition for certain sound cues in your game. Many of the best audiophile headphones have surround sound by default.


Q: Is it worth buying Airpods in 2022?


A: Airpods are the proprietary Apple earbud type. Like most Apple-exclusive products, they’re middle-of-the-road at best instead of being top of the category. Plus, cheap Airpod alternatives strike a better balance between price and quality without Apple’s price-spiking. From my perspective, there are plenty of earbuds that serve as great Airpods alternatives.

Best Hitch Bike Rack Reviews: Your Ultimate Guide For 2022,https://10beasts.com/best-hitch-bike-rack/,"



A mediocre hitch bike rack can spell disaster and ruin your planned day of fun in the mountains or at the bike park. We’ve all experienced some difficulties when it comes to transporting bikes.


Although biking is fun, it’s a pain to load them into a car and take their tires off. Too much work takes away from the joy of the day.


Hitch mounted bike racks are supposed to help with that problem by supporting your bikes to the back of your car, where they can be easily removed and jumped on for riding once you’re at your destination.

Kuat Racks NV 2.0 Bike Rack
 – Premium and Tough

The Kuat Racks NV Bike Rack is a premium choice that’s going to provide you with great service for years to come. It can carry two different bikes, and its heavy, durable frame allows it to hold bikes that are quite hefty. It can take a variety of wheel sizes, so there are a ton of different bikes you can use with this rack.


The bikes are kept well apart, and installing the hitch on the back of your vehicle is easy. No tools are necessary for the tightening phase of the installing process. The hitch presses down with a weight of 49 pounds for optimal security and tightness, even during the bumpier segments of a road trip. Adjusting the rack is relatively easy with the foot assist that was designed with the user in mind. Releasing bikes is easy, too, with an intuitive release button near the ratchet arm.


The trail doc is an interesting addition to the rack, since it provides some great functionality away from the hitch. The doc acts as a repair stand that you can take practically anywhere, since it’s light enough for easy transportation. Once you bring it to your bike, you can make some quick repairs or adjustments and be on your way once again.


It’s a great pick if you like to go off-road biking or mountain biking.


Features:


Two-Bike capacity
Can carry bikes up to 60 lbs
20-29” wheels accepted
Integrated repair stand


It’s a good thing that the 
rack adjustments
 are easy, since the entire apparatus is actually quite heavy. This can make it a challenge for some, but we feel that the foot pedal makes up for this small flaw. Folding the rack up is going to be a bit of an effort, but the stability and sturdiness you get in return make it a small price to pay, in our eyes.


While you get a lot of value from this bike rack, it is a bit pricey, and you can see what you’re paying for in weight alone. It’s a good pick if you’re looking for the utmost quality and security over the price factor. Knowing that you’re buying a bike rack that will last for years to come might be enough to justify the high initial cost, as you won’t need to replace this rack with another as parts degrade or fall out.

Allen Sports Deluxe Hitch-Mounted Bike Rack
 – Affordable for Groups






Sale












$96.00




View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








Let’s look at the Allen Sports Deluxe Bike Rack. It can carry four bikes in total, as opposed to two, so already this is a good choice for families or if you’re planning on making a trip with several friends. The hitch can support up to 140 pounds altogether, so whether you’re mixing the bike weights or bringing four identical bikes each weighing up to 36 pounds, keep this value in mind. The long carry arms are a blessing for making sure that all four bikes aren’t constantly ramming into one another and making noise as you drive.


The rack utilizes a patented tie-down system that’s unique to racks from Allen Sports. This system combines the traditional clamp tech, used by most modern bike hitches to keep tires and frames in place, with a strap that can be added and wound around the bikes, making them even more secure. When you use this tie system, be careful not to secure the bikes too close to one another, or they’ll be more likely to knock into one another as they rattle during transport.


Installing the hitch isn’t totally tool-free, but it is very easy, even for beginners. The hitch is made to last with sturdy steel construction that doesn’t rust easily, although it’s lighter than you would expect. This isn’t a flaw, really, but you should keep it in mind as you drive, in case you go over any minor bumps or drops. The light weight of the hitch will let it move perhaps more than you’re used to.


Features:


Four-Bike capacity
Accepts 140 lbs in total
Features long carry arms


It also requires a really secure hitch clamp to be effective. Some hitches only need to be secured lightly; you’ll want to double-check this one’s security before you drive. This may be due to the construction of the hitch clamp itself. Whatever the case, it’s good to know that there’s a lifetime warranty in case something goes wrong. In this case, you’re getting great value for money as long as you’re willing to use the warranty, as a hitch of this price isn’t going to last as long as something like the Kuat.


It may be worthwhile to pick this one up if you know that you aren’t going to be using it very often or if it’s for a one-time deal, such as a cross-country move or a competitive event.


In any case, while it’s strong enough to last for some time, we don’t recommend it as a pick for a long-term solution for your bike rack needs. You’ll want to go with something with more longevity.

 Patented tie-down system


 Easy to install

Swagman XC Cross-Country 2-Bike Hitch Mount Rack
 – Good for Light Bikes






Sale












$74.52

Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








Now let’s see about the Swagman XC Cross-Country Mount Rack. This can carry two bikes in total, although there are upgrades to allow you to switch to a larger, four-bike model. Each set of arms can carry a bike up to 35 pounds in weight, so it’s a better mount for lighter bikes or kids’ bikes. Despite this relatively light weight limit, the arms are very adjustable, even for larger tires and bikes of varying lengths and shapes.


This means that if you have some more niche bike types, like a carbon-frame bike, it’ll be right at home with this hitch. Larger bikes and tires will, of course, have more difficulty than smaller bike types, due to both the weight limit and the fact that the arms can’t fit fat tires without another additional upgrade that you may not feel like spending the money for.


The hitch makes use of an anti-wobble device that basically tightens the bolts more securely than some other competitors. This is good, because the tire locks themselves aren’t the sturdiest we’ve seen, and you’ll probably want to triple-check before you start on any off-road or bumpy excursion. That being said, the experience while driving is very quiet and smooth, in large part due to the anti-wobble design.


Features:


Two-bike capacity
35 lbs per bike
Adjusts to different bike frame sizes


The hitch is also smartly made with its center arm design folding down for really easy access. Whether this means that kids can load their own bikes or just more convenience for any loader, it’s a good feature that deserves recognition. The entire piece is also really easy to install.


It’s a great choice if you have smaller or lighter bikes than most other riders. Because of its focus, it’ll be a lighter weight to lift up and down, too, so if this is a concern and you aren’t comfortable lifting heavier bike racks, you could always pick something like this one and eliminate that worry as well.


 
 
Pros
 




 Very versatile for different bike types


 Center arms fold down for easy access


 Anti-wobble hitch device


 Easy to install




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Weak tire locks


 Can’t fit fat tires without accessory purchase

Kuat Transfer Universal 2 Bike Hitch Mount
 – Versatile and Easy to Use






Sale












$596.82




View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








The Kuat Transfer Universal Mount is another higher-quality, higher-priced hitch rack that can fit two bikes, each with a maximum weight of around 40 pounds. This is right in the middle of most common bike weight ranges for hitch racks. It has a good spread of accepted tire sizes, too, around 20-29 inches. These aren’t great for fat tires but are fine for “larger” tires that don’t quite fit the “fat” description.


Even if it doesn’t fit the “fat” category, the adjustability is still valuable because it means that you aren’t locked into one specific bike type for the rest of the rack’s lifetime. This can make it a good choice if you find yourself transporting a lot of kids’ bikes or if you have several of your own for different occasions, such as a road bike and a mountain bike, depending on your mood. This versatility also means that different types show bikes can be transported together, although we do recommend driving carefully.


The hitch has a handy foot pedal we really like, since it makes locking the frame and making adjustments with the rack easier and safer than crawling around underneath the bikes as they’re being loaded. This foot pedal also allows anyone, even kids, to use the rack and get their bike down.


Features:


Two-bike capacity
20-29” tires
40 lbs per bike


There are some upgrades available for security pins and cable locks if you’re planning on biking in areas where you’d like a bit more security. However, since this rack is already a bit high when it comes to price, you’ll have to decide if the potential risk is worth another investment. For what you get out of the box, the bikes are secured pretty well and don’t shake too noisily. Importantly, they don’t touch each other, so if you have frames that you want pristine for a show or event, this is a good choice.


Due to the lack of touching, we did notice that the arms are a bit weaker than some competitor models. You won’t run the risk of the bikes falling out of the carrier or anything similarly disastrous, but you might find that you can hear them shifting as you drive.


For show bikes, we recommend adding some padding or wrapping a cloth around the bikes just to be safe. While this can be annoying after a while, it’s not a large enough flaw to dock it too many points in our eyes.


 
 
Pros
 




 Holds larger tires


 Foot pedal at pivot for locking


 Can upgrade rack security with pin and cable locks


 Doesn’t contact or scratch bike frame




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Bikes are susceptible to wobbling since the frame isn’t touched


 A bit pricey

Tyger Auto TG-RK4B102B Deluxe 4-Bike Carrier Rack
 – Great for Families
















$179.00




View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-21 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








The Tyger Auto Deluxe Carrier Rack has enough arms to support four different bikes. These bikes can vary in weight and type, so feel free to mix and match or carry a family’s worth of bikes on this single rack. There’s some extra security afforded by this rack, thanks to its additional straps that come with the purchase.


Basically, in addition to the normal arm clamps that are included with a hitch bike rack, this model comes with a safety strap that you can tie around one bike that might be a bit small for the arms or even the whole collection, if you don’t mind the frames touching one another in transit. This means that the level of security you can reach when combining the arms with the strap is above that of many competitor hitches.


However, we did find that the arms alone were not as secure as some of the others we’ve reviewed. This makes the safety strap very mandatory if your bikes don’t fit perfectly into the arm clamps.


Keep this in mind when you’re deciding on the bikes to take for a particular day of riding. A bike cable is also included for extra safety when you’re parked or for general driving. The arms fold up when they’re not in use for easy parking and storage, and the entire apparatus can shift downward to allow you to load the bikes more easily. This is great if you have heavy bikes in particular.


Features:


Four-bike capacity


The hitch is generally very easy to install, although some hitches might not fit perfectly on the first try. This may require a little creative machine work on your part or some extra weight to force the fit. Either way, it’s a bit of a flaw that you should be aware of. In general, 1.25-inch hitches fit a little better than the larger 2-inch hitches that are supposedly workable with this rack.


The Tyger Carrier Rack is also the best hitch bike rack for the money, since you get so much functionality for an amazing asking price. Few other racks can boast the ability to carry four bikes at once and include accessories like the cable locks and safety straps for this kind of affordability. The fact that it’s so cost-effective and it holds four bikes makes it a great pick if you’ve got a family and everyone has a bike that they want to bring along on the summer trip.


 
 
Pros
 




 Durable construction


 Bike cable lock and safety strap included


 Tilt down feature and foldable arms


 Easy to install




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Bikes sometimes sway without the strap


 Doesn’t fit some hitches

BV Bike Hitch Mount Rack Carrier
 – Very Safe and Secure
















$159.99




View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-21 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








The BV Bike Hitch Mount Carrier is another rack designed for smaller, lightweight bikes that don’t go above 36 pounds per frame. It can carry two bikes in total and is built with special loops and padded arms to secure the bikes more firmly. This is great for smaller, lighter bikes since these types tend to bounce about more easily and slip from arms more frequently than their heavier counterparts.


The rack makes use of anti-wobble bolts to minimize jostling and rustling, too. All of the attention to security on the part of the smaller bike types makes it a great pick if you have carbon-frame bikes or are transporting bikes for kids.


Loading is made easy with its tilt-back accessibility, and it can fold up while you park or while it’s not in use.


The adjustable jaws for the clamps, however, aren’t made with the same thickness of metal as the rest of the model. This means that you might find signs of rust or disrepair on this part of the hitch first, although it wasn’t something we personally were concerned with. It’s just something to be aware of while you’re loading bike; check these segments each time to make sure that nothing is wearing down too quickly. If they are starting to rust, you can take care of that with the right chemical product and a rag.


Features:


Two-bike capacity
35 lbs per bike


Replacement parts are easily obtainable from the manufacturer in the event of damage, but we feel that this will not likely be necessary unless the rack is left in the rain for a long period of time. The biggest danger to thinner pieces on this rack is sudden swerving and turning, which could cause stress on these segments. You should be driving carefully with bikes on the back of your vehicle anyway, though.


In addition, the hitch is another misfit in terms of actually working with the prescribed sizes that it claims to fit. You’ll have to work to get it, but once it’s attached, you’ll find that everything is very secure, especially in comparison to cheaper hitch racks. Altogether, this is a minor flaw when compared to its litany of perks, such as the reflector plate that’s set against its back for greater nighttime visibility. It’s a good hitch rack if you’re transporting kids’ bikes, certainly.


 
 
Pros
 




 Safety rear reflector included


 Anti-wobble design


 Loops and padded arms integrated into the design


 Tilt-back and fold-up functionality




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Adjustment jaws aren’t very thick


 Hitch hole may need trimming

Yakima Products Hold Up Tray Style Bike Rack
 – Good for Show Bikes






Sale












$399.20




View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-21 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








The Yakima Products Bike Rack is a bit of a different style than we’ve seen so far, which you’ll notice as soon as you look at it. It utilizes a pivoting wheel hook to make sure that bikes are secure and stable without letting their frames touch. Since it can carry two bikes, each with a maximum of 60 pounds, this makes it a great pick for show bikes or for taking premium bicycles to and from a location that might have a lot of bumps or winding roads.


The adjustable racks are excellent for any number of bike varieties and types, including ones as small as carbon frame models to the larger, mountain-bike types that you find in a lot of off-road racing competitions. In the spirit of extra security for more expensive bikes, the purchase comes with some cable locks, so you can be at ease if you step away from the hitch for a short while. Alternatively, these locks provide even more security if you’re afraid of the bikes jostling on the road to your destination.


There is the question of longevity. While the rack as a whole is durable and well made, there are a few spots where plastic screws or caps were used in place of metal versions. This was clearly a cost-cutting measure that doesn’t appear to largely affect the rack, at least at first.


Features:


Two-bike capacity
60 lbs per bike
20-29” wheels


We have found that after some use, the plastic pieces tend to wear down more quickly than the other segments. This might mean that you’ll have to find a replacement for the rack, or contact the manufacturer for replacement screws. The rack as a whole is quite pricey, so we were surprised at this apparent cheapness.


It’s not a deal breaker by any measure, but if you’re looking for the ultimate in premium quality there are other racks that don’t use plastic anywhere on their frame.


 
 
Pros
 




 Accommodates carbon road bikes, other varieties


 Pivoting wheel hook secures bike without touching frame


 Adjustable racks to reduce bike-to-bike contact


 Cable locks included




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Cheap plastic screws in places


 Longevity is questionable

Overdrive Sport 2-Bike Hitch Mounted Rack
 – Accepts Fat Tires






Sale












$319.99




View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








Next, let’s take a look at the Overdrive Hitch-Mounted Rack. This can carry two bikes at a time and has arms that are capable of supporting actual “fat” quality tires that are around five inches in diameter. This means that larger bikes are quite at home in this rack, particularly since it can support bikes up to 60 pounds in weight. These two factors alone should make this rack a top contender for your purchase if you have heavier bikes or models with fat tires.


The wheel clamps are adjustable, though, so if you have smaller bikes but like everything else this rack has to offer, you’re still in luck.


Anti-wobble screws are integrated into the design to reduce shaking during transit, which will afford a quieter journey and greater peace of mind concerning frame-touching.


Altogether, this rack has one of the most secure sets of clamps we’ve seen on hitch racks. This is extra important for the fat tire acceptability, since these tires can be so difficult to keep in place with their extra mass. Even if you don’t have bikes with fat tires, you might find that you appreciate the extra security afforded by these clamps.


Features:


Two-bike capacity
5” diameter “fat” tires acceptable
60 lbs per bike


The rack is really easy to install and is built with a quick-release system and a tilting pivot. This lets you remove the bikes at a lower level than their mounted height and do it without having to struggle against the arms or adjust them beforehand. This added convenience is a great system that makes actually using the rack easy, which a lot of racks forgo for security purposes. Even with the quick-release system, your bike should be quite secure and stable during any car trip.


The packaging that comes with the purchase is of a poor quality, which may seem like an odd complaint. This made putting the rack together for installation more of a hassle than it needed to be. In addition, although the rack comes with a reflector panel for nighttime visibility, we found that the plastic covering was very cheap and won’t last for long if it’s banged against something. Altogether, though, these are minor caveats concerning an overall excellent hitch rack.


 
 
Pros
 




 Adjustable wheel clamps


 Anti-wobble system


 Quick-release tilt design


 Easy to install and comes with rear reflector




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Bad packaging


 Reflector plastic isn’t durable

Leader Accessories Hitch Mounted 2-Bike Rack
 – Heavy Duty and Tough






Sale












$79.99




View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-21 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








The Leader Accessories Hitch is a two-bike rack that can carry bikes heavier than any we’ve looked at so far: up to 80 pounds per unit. This huge weight capacity is going to be a great advantage if you’re looking to load bikes that can really tear up off-road trails, such as durable mountain bikes and racing bikes made for heavy-duty tracks.


Because of this weight capacity, you’ll notice that the rack itself is rather heavy and quite unwieldy. Installing the rack might come with some difficulty, since its alignment is hard to manage, and your vehicle might not be the perfect type envisioned by the manufacturer.


It should still work with most automotive hitches of the appropriate size, but we wouldn’t be surprised if you had to put in some elbow grease to get everything locked in.


Despite this, the rest of the rack is made with excellent qualities and features to make it worth the effort and money. The arms can be tilted down for easy loading and removing, and when the rack isn’t in use, it can be folded up against your vehicle, even if it is a bit heavy. No-wobble bolts are included in the rack’s construction to more firmly secure heavy bikes. Shifting bikes of that weight might cause damage to the vehicle or each other, so we’re glad to see that they took the effort to make sure they could handle everything a pair of 80-pound bikes entails.


Features:


Two-bike capacity
80 lbs per bike


Those bolts might rust a little more quickly in comparison to the rest of the rack, but some 
occasional maintenance
 and cleaning (which you should already be doing) will take care of those issues. Overall, we like it as a heavy-bike solution, assuming you don’t mind putting your back into installing the rack securely.


 
 
Pros
 




 Easy tilt-down access


 Easy fold-down arms


 Adjustable mounting saddles


 No-wobble bolts




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Does not align well with all vehicles


 Bolts may rust quickly

Hollywood Racks Sportrider Se Hitch Rack
 – High-Quality and Compact
















$159.99

Last update on 2023-05-21 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








Finally, let’s look at the Hollywood Rack. Hollywood racks are well-known in the biking community for their durability and good quality, and we can see that reflected here. This rack can carry two bikes of a median weight: up to 50 pounds. You can install it all without a bunch of complicated tools, and the rack integrates some no-wobble tech to keep the bikes locked in place and quiet as you drive.


There are security cables that come with this purchase. These add some great value to the overall asking price, which isn’t too bad considering the high-quality of the rack. The cables can be used for their intended 
anti-theft 
purpose or to make extra sure that the bikes mounted on the rack won’t be going anywhere.


The wheel clamps are adjustable for a variety of different bike types, although it doesn’t accept fat tires. Excluding that rare type, you should find that every kind of bike you might want to take out for a spin is workable with this hitch rack.


The fold-up aspect of this rack is very effective, going nearly flat against your car when it’s set. This might be an issue, hypothetically, as it could bang into your back window in the event of an accident. But there’s no denying that it’s handy when you need to fit the car into a crowded garage or parking space.


Features:


Two-bike capacity
50 lbs per bike


The wheel holders are adjustable, and we found that no matter what their setting, they gripped the wheels well enough that you should be satisfied with the level of security you’ll be getting. Some cables are included with the purchase for either an extra layer of traveling security or for peace of mind if you are away from your vehicle for a short time.


This rack is very heavy; be prepared to use your muscles as you install it or lift it up to fold against your car. In addition, the adjustable arms are tough to actually move and manipulate. Both of these aspects are results of how durable the rack is. You’re making a tradeoff, ease of use for sturdiness and a long lifespan. Because racks can already cost quite a lot, we found that the tradeoff was worth it. If you’d rather have a durable rack that takes a little effort to move around than a cheaper but easier model that you’ll have to replace in a few years, you will too.


 
 
Pros
 




 Includes security cables


 No-wobble installation without the need for complex tools


 Adjustable wheel holders


 Flattens against a car and tilts down for easy access

 Heavy


 Not super easy to adjust

Buying Guide


Now that you’ve seen all of the best hitch bike racks on the market, we’re going to explain how you can tell when a bike rack is worth your money. There are 
several key aspects
 that are common among great hitch racks and a few more that are nice to have but aren’t strictly necessary for a good product.


The top features to look for in a hitch bike rack are adjustable arms, dimensions to fit your needs, foldability or collapsibility, durable construction, and a lock that fits 1.25 or 2-inch hitches. These features will let you use most hitch racks for most vehicles and can be considered the key features that mark versatility or widespread appeal.


On the other hand, the perks that are great to have but aren’t truly necessary are safety straps or extra cables, no-wobble bolts or similar tech, foot pedals for adjustments, tilt-down functionality, and four bike slots for double the usual number of bikes. We’ll explain how each of these factors can benefit you below.




Adjustable Arms


Most racks have adjustable arms between a certain range of tire sizes, such as 2-4 inches or so. Others will be lower or higher. It’s rare that bike hitches have arms that can take “fat” tires with diameters of 5 inches or more.


Adjustable arms are a very important factor to look for when you’re finding a hitch bike rack. Why does this matter? Not all bike tires are the same and finding a hitch rack with arms that are perfect for your bike’s tire diameter is going to be practically impossible. Instead of finding the perfect match and limiting your use of the hitch to one size of tire, adjustable arms allow you to use the same rack for a variety of bikes.


However, if you do have fat tires of those specifications, you’ll need to make sure that your target hitch’s arms can support your bike, or you’ll have wasted a bunch of cash for nothing.


Thankfully, the tire range that hitches can support can be found on the box in a physical store or on any product page. This is considered a critical technical aspect, so make sure to double-check before you buy.


Dimensions 




This refers to both the dimensions of the hitch rack and the 
dimensions of your car.
 Obviously, it’s imperative that you pick a rack that can fit your car. Most of these racks are going to be fine for standard-size SUVs or pickup trucks, but you should double check just to be sure.


When it comes to the best trailer hitch bike rack, try to find a rack that’s short enough to not add a lot of extra drag to your turns. Trailers are already difficult enough to manage without adding a hitch that’s really long and can make driving dangerous or more complicated. Go for shorter, stockier racks as opposed to longer, lankier ones. This may mean that you won’t find a four-bike rack to be the best trailer hitch bicycle rack.


Foldability




The next major aspect to consider when finding the best bike carrier is foldability. This kind of functionality is important because you aren’t going to want to disengage the rack every time you need to park your car in the garage or take up more space on the road of your neighborhood. When the bikes are off, there’s no reason for the rack to be extended.


Foldable bike racks can become drastically smaller thanks to their ability to press up against your car. This will allow you to store the rack and keep it attached to the hitch when it’s not in use, saving you time and valuable garage space. While most bike racks have a foldability aspect to their designs, there are a few here and there that lack this crucial feature. If you find that space is at a premium when it comes to parking, this perk is a must-have for your bike rack.


Heavier bike hitch racks will obviously be harder to lift up and secure on your car. If you find that you have trouble lifting 50 pounds or more, you’ll need to find a rack that is lighter so that you can reliably maneuver it to take advantage of this feature.


Durability




Next, check to see how durable the rack is. This can be done by examining the product description and searching for terms relating to the kind of material used for the rack’s construction. Most bike hitch racks are made from steel or similarly-tough metal, so you should have no problem finding such a rack anywhere you look.


However, when it comes to screws and pins, things aren’t so simple. Some hitch racks have screws and pins that are made of lesser materials. This isn’t always a deal breaker, since you can usually get cheap replacements relatively quickly. However, metal screws are always better, because this usually translates to better security and a tighter fit for all the relevant pieces of a rack.


If at all possible, go for an all-metal model when you choose your hitch bike rack. But if you have to get one that has some plastic pieces, it’s not the end of the world. Most of the more premium or higher-priced bike hitch racks will forgo plastic entirely, although this is not always the case.


Common Lock


The lock for the hitch needs to be able to take the hitch size your vehicle is equipped with. Since you probably don’t have a very specific, unique hitch with its own precise dimensions, you can safely bet that the right hitch size for your vehicle is between 1.25 and 2 inches. This means that you should find a hitch rack that’s rated for hitches that size and nothing else.




Some racks are only suitable for 2-inch hitches, which will limit your options somewhat. However, there are plenty of racks that can be purchased for variable hitch sizes or are even adjustable to some degree. Basically, this is just another aspect you need to double check as part of your measuring before you make any final purchases.


The best way to handle all of these aspects is to investigate the car you’ll be using with the hitch rack and checking these dimensions out for yourself, writing them down, and then start looking for the best bike rack hitch. Because most of them are made for most hitch-ready vehicles, you shouldn’t have any trouble finding an acceptable model for your vehicle of choice.


Safety Straps


Now let’s get into the extra features to check for. These are excellent additions to any hitch bike rack, since they immediately improve the security potential of any rack. Safety straps add an additional layer of stabilization to any bikes locked in the clamps.




Most safety racks can be tied to straps according to your specifications so you can use them for one bike, in particular, that might be a bit too small for your clamps. Or, you can wrap the strap around the entire collection to keep them all tightly held together. Obviously, don’t use this method if you’re worried about the frames scratching each other as they travel.


Along the vein of extra safety materials, some hitch racks come with safety cords or belts that are meant to be added to the bikes to protect them against theft or vandalism. They usually come with a lock or key and are great for protecting your bikes if you have to leave the vehicle for a short while.


While these are nice to have, they’re not necessary and should be looked at as some extra value for a purchase you were already going to make for other reasons. If you really want safety cords for anti-theft purposes, but they don’t come with your top bike rack pick, you can always buy them separately for a low cost and add them to your kit.


No-Wobble


A lot of the best hitch bike racks come with some kind of anti-wobble tech or addition, usually in the form of super-tight screws or a pivoting head that rides with the movement of your vehicle. This basically just prevents the bikes from wobbling and shaking, which provides three benefits.




First, it makes them quieter as you drive. If you’ve dealt with wobbly bikes before, you know that listening to them constantly rattle can grate on one’s nerves very quickly. Anti-wobble additions are good because they stop bikes from rubbing or scratching against each other, too. Finally, these prevent bikes from possibly shaking out of the clamps if they weren’t secured properly; this kind of mistake can happen if you drive over terrain where there are a lot of smaller bumps in a short period of time.


No-wobble tech or pieces aren’t needed, but they definitely drive the value of any particular hitch rack up in our eyes. It’s probably more necessary if you’re going off-road driving for mountain biking or something similar. If you plan to stick to the paved roads, however, it’s less needed and just a nice feature to have.


Foot Pedals




These are excellent if you hate having to bend down and mess with the tight controls or adjustment levers of some bike racks. These let you use your foot to make adjustments, lower the hitch rack, or release the bikes depending on its exact function. The function of the foot pedal will differ based on the particular rack, so pay close attention to product descriptions to make sure that it’s included to do what you have in mind.


This feature can be particularly useful if you can’t handle the pressure and weight requirements to adjust a lot of modern hitch racks. Consider who’s going to be using the racks and taking bikes off and on before you decide that you need a foot pedal for certain.


Tilt-Down




A tilt-down feature is along the same vein as the foot pedal, in that it makes it easier to load or remove bikes from the hitch rack. The tilt feature needs to be reset after you’re done, though, because it can drag against the ground as you drive away if you’re not paying attention.


In general, most bike racks won’t be so high off the ground that this is a necessary feature, but it can be handy depending on the particular user or vehicle.


The tilt-down feature also needs to be checked frequently to make sure that it all locks back into place before you start driving or when you’re folding the rack back up against the car for parking purposes. This is a joint that is susceptible to rust and other damage, so checking for these problems every so often will save you from a headache later on.


Four Slots




Most hitch bike racks can only carry two bikes side-by-side. Of course, if you plan on taking more bikes, you should look for a four-bike hitch rack to take everything at once. Be aware that these racks are almost always heavier than their two-bike counterparts and may require a little more effort to install and adjust.


With four-bike racks, things like the tilt-down functionality and anti-wobble tech are more needed than with two-bike racks. You’ll be dealing with more bikes at once, so the better quality of rack you get, the better. You should consider getting a more premium rack than not, since it’ll likely come with these types of perks right out of the box, including things like safety straps to really make sure that jostling won’t be an issue.


You should also check the dimensions very carefully when it comes to four-bike racks, since not all cars are big enough to carry that many bikes. The smaller the car, the more carefully you should consider this aspect.


Most four-bike racks aren’t going to have the space to support fat tire bikes, although there are exceptions to this rule. Usually, you’ll be more able to find two-bike racks that can fit in fat tires, however.


Conclusion


Above all, get the hitch bike rack that’s right for your needs, regardless of what the reviews say or what’s currently the most popular on the market. These are tools that are supposed to help you and your bikes, but they won’t be of much use if you get the wrong rack that doesn’t fit your bikes’ tires, for instance. In addition, we recommend paying attention to price and considering the length of time you plan to use the rack.


When it comes to price, it’s always better to purchase a more expensive hitch bike rack that will last you for years to come rather than to buy a sub-par bike rack for less of an initial cost. This is because a cheap bike rack is likely to fail and cause trouble the more you use it.


This is both bad financially and is also possibly dangerous; you’re towing bikes at the back of your car, after all. Getting a good rack that you don’t have to replace in a year is likely to save you money overall and better protect your bikes and vehicle.


Overall, picking the best option for your hitch bike rack will end up satisfying you more than settling. Settling with safety equipment is never a smart idea, anyway!We hope that this guide has given you the information you need to find the best hitch bike rack for your needs. Knowing ahead of time what to buy and why it’s worth the cost is the best method to save time and money and guarantee satisfaction with your purchase. Whether you’re planning on mountain biking or taking a scenic ride with the kids in the park, we hope you have a great time with your new bike rack! 
Don’t forget to carry
 a battery charger, an air pump and 
other stuff
 which is important for your car.

Best Car Automotive Battery Chargers Reviewed – Top 10 Brands Revealed,https://10beasts.com/best-car-battery-charger/,"



It’s time for another day of work. You hop into the car, hot coffee in hand, already running behind, and it happens. Turn the key, and click click click click click. Oh no, not the dreaded clicking noise…Come on baby, not today, not now! You try again, turning the key, praying. Click. Click. Click click click. Lifeless.


We’ve all been there. We have all felt that panicky dread in our gut, sent those frantic cries for help, cursed our car for deciding to die at the worst possible moment. You’re stranded, waiting for a jump to take you to the mechanic, and wondering how much money the new battery is going to cost this time and worrying about how to pay for it.


Isn’t there something we can do to stop this from ever happening again??Yes, in fact there is. While it’s true that all batteries will eventually need to be replaced (just like tires or 
windshield wipers
), it doesn’t have to be a guessing game or leave you stranded when you’re caught unaware.


Car battery chargers are great tools for any car owner. These can get you a jump and recharge your battery to avoid leaving you stranded, and many of them can even monitor your battery’s health so you get enough early warning to prepare for the inevitable replacement costs.




 


An Overview Of The Best Car Battery Chargers


There are some important things to know before selecting the best car battery charger for your car. Who makes the best car battery charger? What is the best 12 volt battery charger? What is the best car battery charger based on consumer reports?


In this guide, we will introduce you to the top rated automotive battery chargers based on input from the experts, comprehensive product reviews, and our own experience. We have looked into the important features, like amperage, portability, voltage compatibility, and whether it’s good for maintenance and battery health optimization. We narrowed the options down to our top 10 car battery charger brands to make your decision as easy as possible.


Before we go into that, we want to put a few key details in your mind. Ask yourself whether you are looking for a way to 
jump start
 a dead battery or whether your focus is on long term battery maintenance. There are different chargers optimized to do these tasks. If you want something to do both, this is also possible.


Next, decide how patient you are. Some of these are manual chargers that will require you to monitor the battery process over time, and some are automated and let you do other things. The trade off is that some of the more automated options also take much longer to charge.


When you look at the amps and engine start, there are two things that will help you immediately narrow down our top 10 to your top few. Most people will only need between 700 milliamps and 20 amps.


Jump start boosts can often require more power, and if you’re only trying to maintain batteries for cars and boats that stay idle for long periods of time (not to mention the constant 
vacuuming your car needs
), you don’t need as many amps. Engine start is a feature that works like jumper cables from a friendly stranger when you’re stranded, but without requiring that you wait for a friendly stranger to pass by.


This feature isn’t necessary unless you plan to use your car battery charger as an emergency jump to prevent you from being stranded.Let’s take a look at the best auto battery chargers side by side with some of the most important features to consider. We have included an Amazon links to these because even Amazon considers them the best rated car battery chargers available.

View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








The NOCO Genius charges both 6 and 12 volt batteries. We have focused on the 3500 model here, but this is a consistent choice among experts as one of the best car battery brands because the model comes in a wide range of amperes, so if you don’t need 3.5 amps you can go as low a .75 or as high as 26 amperes.

$145.54




View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








The CTEK company specializes in car batteries and chargers. They focus on three things: safety, simplicity, and flexibility. Perhaps this is why they are the “fan favorite” of this list.


They have the highest consumer rating across all sites, come with the most referrals as an expert choice, and have the most vocal supporters who swear by their products. Most people who purchase a CTEK product continue to purchase within the CTEK family of products for the rest of their needs.

Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








I was skeptical about the Motopower charger because of its extremely low price compared to other models, but I decided to give it a shot and see if it was worth trading some features for affordability. I was pleasantly surprised!


Features:


800 mAmp
Fully automatic


It is important to keep in mind that this is a budget-friendly model. It will not have all of the bells and whistles that come with the other products on this list, but it will also come at less than half the price of most other models.


If you don’t need a rush job and are willing to surrender your control over when it uses which mode, this is definitely the best value car battery charger on our list. It will charge your battery just as well as the other chargers; you’ll just have to wait longer for the charge.


 
 
Pros
 




 Extremely budget friendly


 Portable and compact


 Easy to use




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Very low power


 Long charge time

Optima Digital 400
 — Revives Discharged Batteries




















View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








The Optima is a great purchase for reviving dead batteries. In fact, it can revive batteries that have been discharged for lower than 1.25 volts. This feature really makes it stand out from the crowd.

9. 
DB Power 600 A
 — Jump Start Kit


This is a great option for travelers. It is small enough to fit right into your car’s glove compartment but powerful enough to jump start your car 20 times with a single use.


It offers a compass and LED flashlight in case you get stuck and even offers a flashing SOS emergency light. The USB port allows you to charge your cell phone so it can be used in emergencies. In fact, it also has a red light to warn oncoming traffic that you’re stuck, increasing your visibility to keep you safe.


Features:


600 amps!
USB port to charge additional tech
Compass and LED flashlight


That being said, with this charger you should never be stuck for long. This is more than just a car battery charger – it’s an entire jump start kit for your car.


The reason I love this so much is that it is multi-functional and portable. Most jumps require another car or a massive kit that requires you to be near a wall charger or takes up tons of space, making it not at all portable or friendly for use outside of a garage. This one is perfect for anyone who is on the go!


 
 
Pros
 




 Jump starts car quickly


 Insanely high power


 Compact and portable


 Prevents overcharging and short circuit issues




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Instructions not very clear


 Doesn’t maintain low charges well

Buying Guide


When looking at a list of features, it can sometimes help with the basics but not the comparison. If all of these are great options, how do you narrow down from the top 10 car battery charger brands to the best auto battery charger from the list? Decide which features matter to you.


If you’re like me, you won’t know what things like car start and active monitoring really are. What really puzzled me was reverse polarity protection. We know that batteries come with positive and negative sides, but we didn’t think it was possible to reverse these without magnets or that it might be desirable to reverse them at all.


We needed to look into what, exactly, these features meant. The good news is that because we did the research, you won’t have to! Everything you need to know about these features is listed here.


What are amperes, and how many of them do you need? What’s the difference between voltage? What are the features that need to come standard, and which ones are just fancy additions?


We’ve broken down the most common features offered by the best rated car battery chargers, so you know exactly what they mean. Knowing your reason for buying a charger can help you decide which ones are better suited for your needs and which features can be sacrificed to save your budget.


We have endeavored to answer a few of the most frequently asked questions in this section. After all, if you are wondering how these work and what they’re designed to do, you won’t want to be bombarded with features. Once we answer a couple common questions,  We’ll walk you through some of the common language regarding car battery chargers and what you need to know.




How To Use A Car Battery Charger


Before we talk about the features, it’s important to touch on how to use this product. Dealing with electricity can be scary and dangerous when it isn’t done properly. While this list maintained a minimum safety standard that should prevent the worst injuries, we don’t want any at all.


These chargers work by lining cables up with your battery and letting electrical current flow through them. Here are some of the basics you need to know to operate them.


First and foremost, do not plug your charger in or turn it on as your first step. It is important to connect it before allowing the current through, otherwise you may end up with electrical sparks flying from the cables, and that’s a fire hazard.


The biggest question most people have is what clamps to what? In this case, it is important to remember to THINK. Because great minds…THINK ALIKE. If you keep that phrase in mind, it will be much easier for you to remember that you want to match positive with positive and negative with negative. Why? Because great minds think ALIKE.


Now, you can turn the charger on and start charging. For intuitive chargers, this should be all you need to do. If your charger has manually input settings, follow individual instructions to tell it what voltage your battery is and how much charge you need.


Important Safety Tip: Do not touch or move the cables during the charging process! Cut the power before attempting to make adjustments or remove the cables.


Once your battery is finished charging and you have turned the power off, it is safe to remove the chargers. Your battery should be ready to go.




Can You Charge A Dead Battery?


This isn’t an easy question to answer, but it is a common one. The question to ask when determining the answer is how the battery died in the first place. If the battery just went a really long time between uses, or you forgot to turn your headlights off all day, then most likely the answer is yes, with enough amperes and time, you can recharge. We included a car battery charger on our list that is exceptional at charging dead batteries, even those who have discharged down below 2 volts.


The unfortunate truth is that all batteries do have a predetermined lifespan. While proper maintenance can optimize longevity, the battery will eventually die. If your battery died again after multiple recharges, and this isn’t the first time it happened, then unfortunately, you will likely need to replace the battery, and even purchasing a battery charger wont save it.


Size


Battery chargers come in a wide range of sizes. Some of them are extremely portable but will take a while to charge and be unable to jump start a completely dead battery. Others are extremely powerful and include jump start capability but are equally heavy beasts that will take up half your trunk space if you decide to keep it in your car.


Reverse Polarity Protection


One of the features that all of these choices have in common is reverse polarity protection. This is a safety feature that prevents electrocution or sparks from flying if you accidentally connect the cables to the wrong end of the battery.


Amperes




These chargers come in a variety of amperes. The range determines capability. It’s important to know what your primary use will be for the charger. Lower amperes will take longer to charge your battery, but trickle charging makes maintenance a breeze. These are great options if you don’t use a car very often but want to be sure the battery won’t go dead when it is left idle for too long.


Higher ampere options will cost more, but they are better options for protection against battery deaths and will prevent you from being stranded. Many of the higher ampere products can jump start a dead battery to get you on the road again without having to wait for charges. Even those that don’t  jump start a dead battery immediately will take significantly less time to charge dead batteries than lower ampere models.


For most purposes, an amp range between 750 milliamps to 20 amps should be more than sufficient. More power isn’t requires unless you’re looking for a way to jump start your car, and any less power will take a really long time to charge your battery and may not be able to maintain it optimally.


Car Start


This feature is not as common among different models. It will cost more to purchase a battery charger with the ability to start your car, because it takes a lot more power. If you want the reassurance that you won’t be stranded f your battery dies while you’re out, then this is a nice feature.


Active Monitoring


This feature is standard among most low ampere chargers, and we would not recommend buying a product that didn’t include it. Active monitoring allows a charger to tell you about your battery.


The lower ampere models will use it to determine when an unused battery starts losing charge. It will activate the battery to allow it to begin charging, then switch back off to prevent overcharging when it notices the battery is fully charged.


More comprehensive chargers have more informative active monitoring. Many of these chargers can give you detailed information about your car 
battery’s health
. They will warn you when it is permanently losing life, let you know how much charge you’ve got in it, and even safeguard against common battery killers to lengthen your car battery’s lifespan.


Repair Mode


The battery chargers on this list frequently include 
repair modes
. The idea behind chargers is that users want a way to extend their battery life and recharge from home without expensive trips to the mechanic. This is why we consider a repair mode to be an essential feature of any car battery charger. This feature reduces buildup to prolong battery life.  


Voltage




Know your car’s battery voltage. Different chargers are optimized for different voltage batteries. Most car batteries are 
12 volts
, so all of the chargers on this list are compatible with 12 volt batteries. Many of them are also compatible with the 6 volt batteries commonly found in golf carts, sports vehicles, and  motor sport vehicles. Be sure to get a charger that is compatible with your voltage. A few of the ones on this list are versatile enough to cover several battery types.


AGM


Absorbent glass mat (AGM) is a feature commonly found among the newer car battery chargers. Older cars won’t need to worry about this feature, but if you have a brand new model, it may have an 
AGM battery
. This new battery type works the same way, but instead of having liquid interiors, these chemicals are stored in glass sheets. These are most commonly found in motorcycles and new model luxury cars.


Looking at your battery will tell you what type you have. Most batteries are flooded lead acid (FLM), AGM , or Gel (gel-filled) batteries. Make sure that your charger is compatible with your battery type.


Warranty




This can be a pricey purchase. It isn’t necessarily going to be used right away, and issues won’t show up immediately if you are purchasing it as a backup in case of emergency. Because of this, you’ll want to know the warranty coverage. Most of these come with a 5-year standard warranty. Some of them cover even more time.


Along with the warranty, be sure to check into the company. A warranty is useless if the company’s customer service is nonexistent. Also, many companies require you to pay for shipping the faulty product back to them for repairs. On such a heavy item, the lower-end models can often cost nearly as much to redeem warranties than just buying a new one, and the process will take much longer.


Conclusion


Choosing the right car battery charger is a pretty complicated decision. There are a lot of different factors that determine which battery charger is best for your needs, and there is not a single right answer for every car battery.


We sincerely hope this guide has helped you to find the best car battery charger for your needs. After this, you should know what each feature does and how much power you will need for the job you want this charger to do. You should now be confident that you can make the right decision and have a couple of options that have been vetted and chosen as the best on the market.

Top Rated Portable Jump Starter Reviews To Kick Your Car Battery Back To Life,https://10beasts.com/best-jump-starter/,"

Remember when you could almost predict when your car battery was going to die?




Aside from the ultimate demise of your battery’s lifespan, you never had to worry about your car being unwilling to turn over when you were ready to drive.


Did you remember to turn off your headlights and interior lights? Great, you didn’t have anything to worry about. You rarely got stranded anywhere unless you didn’t know your battery was nearing the end of its lifespan, and nothing was drawing much power.


What’s Draining Our Batteries?


Then, things slowly began to change. Cigarette lighters began drawing charge even after cars were turned off for the evening.


We began using power for our MP3 players, bluetooth devices, and cell phone chargers. Cars began offering multiple USB ports, and oftentimes you could plug a hub into those ports so that each port also charged multiple devices.


Even laptops could be charged while traveling, which had reliable internet access because they were tethered to portable networks or cell phone data.


All of this began taking a toll on battery life expectations. It made it harder to predict when the battery might run low on power. This is especially true for road trips, where cars will often remain idling as someone takes a quick bathroom break or snack trip and draw power even while the engine is off for extended periods of time, like when you’re so exhausted you just need to stop for a power nap.


This is why an essential part of roadside 
emergency preparedness
 now includes a car jump starter. A jump starter can be used to restart a car instead of waiting for a kind stranger to stop and help. Jump starters provide a quick shock to a car’s battery to give it enough charge to turn over the engine. Once the engine powers back on, the alternator can kick in to begin 
recharging the battery
.




 


An Overview Of The Best Car Battery Jump Starters


I have done a lot of research to help you find the right jump starter for your needs. I endeavored to answer the common questions about what each feature is and how it relates to your purchasing decision. If words like 
ampere
 and 
volt
 mean nothing to you, then by the end of this buyer’s guide, you will have a full understanding of what they are and how they relate to one another.


I’ve broken down the common terms involved with car batteries and jump starters and explained what each feature means and how to determine what the ideal levels are for your vehicle needs.


I have given each product an in-depth breakdown of their features, strengths, and weaknesses and assigned each one a nickname that denotes its most outstanding feature for easy comparison among similar models.


If you’re not even sure how to operate a jump starter, then check out the buyer’s guide section below. These models all follow the same basic principle, and I have included step-by-step instructions with pneumonic devices that will help you remember what to do.

Clore Automotive Jump n Carry JNC 300XL
 — Balanced Option
















$85.94




View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








This model is a nice balance of features to value. It carries a peak amp that sits towards the middle of the available ampere range. The weight is also right in the middle – not as light and compact as some but also not a heavy model.

It’s got a lot of the basic features, like LED flashlight and a DC outlet, but doesn’t have advanced options for them, like SOS strobes and laptop charging. The extra long cables make it really nice to use, but the wider clamps essentially balance out the cable length because they are harder to maneuver in smaller spaces.


If you’re looking for a budget model that balances features to cost and don’t need a ton of extras, then this is the best jump starter for you.


 
 
Pros
 




 Full size clamps to penetrate corrosion


 27 inch cables for easy reach-around use


 Capable of jump starting 5 and 6 cylinder vehicles




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 No returns accepted


 Wide clamps difficult to use in narrow spaces


 Warranty costs more than new one after fees and shipping

Buying Guide


When looking at a list of features, it can sometimes help with the basic statistics but not the comparison knowledge. Many of the best rated portable jump starters share a lot of common features, so they start blending together. How do you distinguish them and get the one you need?


A frustrating aspect of this particular market is that there isn’t any consistency in determining specs and features that are important. Several of the options do not include critical information like cranking amps, and none of them explain what each feature is or does.


A lot of companies take advantage of novice buyers by featuring their extremely high peak 
amperage ratings
 but hide more crucial data like performance and safety features.


I have done the research ahead of time to try to answer a few of the most common questions about these devices. This buyer’s guide to the top rated portable jump starters breaks down the common features and explains how they work and what you may need them to do.




How To Jump Start Your Car


Before I talk about the different models, let’s tackle a basic question for new users. How does this thing work? If you don’t know anything about cars, this can be very intimidating and scary. You don’t want to spark a fire or get electrocuted.


It is important to take your time with this and do it correctly. Before you direct any power through the cables from the charger, make sure to connect the wires. It would be very dangerous for live wires to cross or come into contact with anyone.


One common question is which cable connects to which battery terminal. Even experts can mix this up when they rush things or blank on the facts. Just remember that you’d like your car to start if it’s all the same to you.  


This common phrase holds the key to remembering where to put the cables. If it’s all the SAME to you, then you will remember to connect the positive cable to the positive terminal and the negative to the negative. Another helpful thing is to THINK POSITIVE.


Great minds think alike, so if you remember this then you’ll also remember that the same colors go together. Remembering to think POSITIVE reminds you to connect the positive (red) cable before the negative (black) one.


Once the cables are secured to the battery, turn on the power. Then, crank up your car.


If it fails, let it rest for a couple minutes then try again. Never crank the engine for more than 5 seconds. The jump starters are designed to deliver a lot of power in short bursts, and forcing it to keep going for longer periods of time may cause it to overheat.


As soon as your car turns over, turn off the power to the jump starter, and disconnect your cables. Remember to let the engine run for a while so that your alternator can charge the battery.  


Types Of Jump Starters


There are several different types of jump starters out there. Here’s a breakdown of the most common types. We have included a few of each model in our list of favorites.


Air Compressors: Several models maximize roadside assistance features by including air compressors to inflate tires and prevent flats. These come in handy on long road trips, especially in the summer, where the heat can rapidly deflate tires. These can also be used around the house for increased convenience. Air compressors can inflate rafts, bouncy toys, pool accessories, and air mattresses for when you’re expecting more company than you have beds.


Multi-function Jump Starters: These are jump starters that have more uses than just a battery jump. Several models are capable of jump starting your car, then continuing to maintain battery charge passively to avoid further need for jumps. Many of them now come with USB ports and flashlights as standard options, so you can charge multiple devices on the go.


Portable: There is a huge market for miniature models that stow away in the glove compartment. These little jump starters pack a huge punch of power and are capable of starting most light passenger cars on the go. For the extreme version of this, you can sacrifice power for pocket sized models. These are micro starters that can be used for a single jump in emergency situations.


Size


There are a lot of different sizes and weights among the best battery jump starters. Determine whether you want to trade some portability and space for features. A couple of our options will fit into the glove compartment, but the trade off is that they offer less power or fewer charges.


Some of the chargers are much larger and heavier, but they offer more protections. For these, you sacrifice some of the portability in exchange for a compressor that can fix your tire pressure and a charger with more power. Know how much space you are willing to give your charger in your car, and go from there.


Reverse Polarity Protection


If you’re like me, you had no idea what this feature was. I did some research and learned that this is a fancy way of saying you won’t get electrocuted or end up with sparks flying around if you accidentally connect the negative cable to the positive battery side or vice versa.


This feature will often come with a light on the display indicating that you’ve connected them improperly. If there isn’t a light but the charger doesn’t work, then check the cables. Many of them offer silent protection.




Amperes


The ampere level measures your power output. This is extremely important to look into when buying a jump starter. As a rule of thumb, the larger your car is, the more amperes will be required to jump start it.


A term you will hear discussed on each model is peak ampere levels. This is the maximum power output capable with this device. The higher the ampere, the more output you receive.


When a car dies, it needs to be recharged in multiple places. First, your battery needs enough power to get moving again. Second, there are a lot of essential functions powered by the battery. You will need enough power to start the crankshaft and motor so that the alternator can take over and begin to power your battery.


The best way to determine how much power you need to get your car going is by reading your owner’s manual or calling your local dealership and asking about the ampere range for jump starters for your model. Your battery’s specifications should provide the answers.


A lot of novice buyers get swindled by the peak amp rating. I was one of them. This is essentially the maximum power output, but it has very little to do with optimal jump start capabilities. What manufacturers look at is the cranking amp rating.


The cranking amp rating determines how much power it can generate for about 30 seconds at a time while maintaining the minimum voltage requirements for standard 12 volt batteries.


Essentially, this is the ampere rating you will need to look at to know whether you can crank and start your car’s engine for nearly any weather. Higher cranking amps will be better able to start cars across any climate or conditions.


Weather Conditions


Most car jump starters are tested using a standard condition and assuming average climates. If you live in an area where winter lasts all year, you need to check an additional rating. This is called the cold crank amp rating. It’s like the crank amp, but this one is specifically rated for cold temperatures.


Voltage


Voltage refers to the stored energy potential in an electrical system. It’s kind of like the pressure system of the car’s energy. If you remember high school science, this is essentially the potential energy your battery has stored that can be easily converted into kinetic energy to power the engine.


For jump starters, this is what moves the electric current from the device to your car’s battery. Choosing the right voltage is easy in this case. Match it to your car’s battery. The majority of passenger cars come with 12 volt batteries, whereas trucks and trailers use 24 volts.


It is important to know the voltage information for the product and your car. Current can be a tricky thing to handle, and it isn’t always the safest, either.


Check under the hood and confirm with your owner’s manual before looking into the best car jump starter, because each one is optimized to specific voltages. Most common vehicle makes and models feature a 12 volt battery. Water sports, ATVs, motorcycles, electric cars, and larger trucks may vary.




Cables


The top rated portable jump starters all come with varying cable lengths. This is a category that is mostly up to personal preference. Experts recommend a minimum of 12 feet of cable. Any more than that is a bonus. A lot of people prefer to set their car jumper on the ground instead of on the car because it makes them feel safer and more in control. This means that they should be looking for cables that are long enough to reach from the ground to the battery without difficulty.


Another factor that goes into determining which cables are best for you is the gauge of the wires inside the cables. Resistance plays a large part in circuits and electricity. Basically, the thinner the wires (gauge), the longer it will take to get power to your battery.


Unlike amperes, this is a case where the lower numbers translate to higher quality ratings. I do not recommend anything above an 8 gauge cable, because the diameter will be so thin that the ampere rating won’t matter. It won’t be able to get the power through the cables in time to do any good.  The optimal rating is a 6 gauge. While 2 gauge cables are even better, they are also pretty pricey, and a 6 gauge is the best value option that can still get the job done.


Balancing Value With Features


This is a major purchase. It’s important to determine your budget and work from there. Portable options are pretty cheap, but they also have lower power levels and crank amp ratings. Professional grade units come with extended lifetime, loads of features, and plenty of power, but they can cost a lot of money, and most cars won’t need that much to get going.


A lot of these options come with tons of additional features. Balance them with your lifestyle. If you can’t road trip without tons and tons of gadgets, then it may be awesome to use the USB features to charge devices. Some of them even allow you to plug your laptops into the car’s power source. Any of the jump starters that have inverters will allow you to plug in your appliances.


Another really useful feature is an air compressor. This allows you to add some air to your tires when they get low to avoid flats. It has an extra layer of safety reassurance to avoid roadside emergencies, but doesn’t often come for free. Other emergency functions include flashlights, compasses, and lighting that will flash SOS to flag down anyone who understands the code, or simply light your vehicle to show passersby that you are there, keeping you safe.




Safety Guidelines


When using a jump starter, it is important to read the user manual for all safety specifications. Each unit is different and functions differently. Here are some universal practices to enact for increased safety, so you don’t end up in even more trouble.


Make sure your battery terminals and connection clamps are always in good condition. They should be free of dirt and decay.


Avoid jump starting your car in heavy rain. If this isn’t possible, find a safe way to shield your battery and engine form the worst of the trouble. Keeping water away from electricity is crucial. Water conducts electricity and can make the jump start process extremely dangerous.


Thick gloves can also help protect you from any possible sparks and discharge. They will offer a layer of insulation to your hands. Rubber gloves are optimal, because rubber is an insulator.


Safety goggles can also protect the eyes, but I understand that your car isn’t a science lab, so these are just some options for those of you who worry more or have less experience. The jump starters on this list all offer reverse polarity protection and anti-sparking safety measures to decrease instances of sparks.


Before you start the process, remove any loose and dangling jewelry. There is no reason to let your bracelet or necklace snag on cables or get tangled in the engine. Make sure that your hair is tied back if it is long enough to hang down.


Always unplug any accessories in the car. Don’t leave phone chargers and cables attached. The jump start process sends a surge of electrical current through the car, and that can cause these to short out and damage your phones. When you do this, also turn off anything that requires electricity to run. This includes radio, headlights, interior lights, and yes – even your hazard lights.


Make sure your car is in park and engage the parking brake.


Always connect the red (positive) clamp before the black (negative) clamp. A good way to remember the connection process is to THINK POSITIVE. Great minds Think ALIKE. This helps you remember to connect red to red and black to black. When you Think POSITIVE, you will remember to connect the positive charge (red) first.


Avoiding Damage


It is important to use these correctly if you don’t want to permanently damage your car. Placing the cables improperly can short out a lot of fuses and sensors and damage the alternator, so slow down and THINK POSITIVE to connect them correctly.


Match your specifications. If you are using a 24 volt system on your car’s 12 volt battery, this is not going to help your car jump faster or more efficiently. It will actually overload your car’s entire electrical system. The products on my list are all rated for 12 volt car systems, but some older models still use 6 volts and don’t have overcharge protections to safeguard against this mistake.




Warranty Guides


The best battery jump starter isn’t always the same thing as the cheapest one. This is a major purchase, and most people are buying it for use in an emergency situation that they hope will never actually happen to them.


This means that having a great warranty is important. Make sure you trust the company and their warranty before you make a purchase. I recommend giving their customer service line a call to test their responsiveness and willingness to answer some questions. If this is a difficult process, then trying to redeem your warranty will likely be difficult as well, should the need arise.


Conclusion


It is important to remember that jump chargers are not meant to be permanent solutions. If you need a jump because of something like forgetting to turn the headlights off, you should be okay, but otherwise make sure to get your car to a mechanic (having a bike on 
hitch rack
 definitely helps if you are stranded on the road)


The battery may be nearing the end of its life, or your alternator could be malfunctioning. Jump starters are just a quick boost to get your engine powered up; make sure to leave your car’s engine running for a while after you recharge, so that the car’s battery will get back enough power to turn over on its own next time you crank the starter.


I hope that this guide has taught you a little more about cars and given you some peace of mind about making your next road trip. You should have been able to narrow my shortlist down to only a couple of products that fit your needs (which includes proper functioning wipers to help 
keep your windshield clean
). You’ve learned enough about the features to make an informed decision with the knowledge that every product on this list meets a minimum standard of safety and reliability.

Although it’s not something a majority of people don’t know about, a lot of people usually miss out important information simply because they don’t pay attention or it doesn’t concern them.


In simpler words, the windshield wipers are basically the wipers that are installed on the windshield of a vehicle.


We use the word 
“Vehicle”
 because these wipers install on a lot of vehicles rather than just on cars. These wipers are there to make sure that whenever you are driving out and there’s rain or snowfall outside, you will be able to clear it from your windshield in order to make sure that your view isn’t obstructed somehow.




Believe it or not, driving a vehicle without a windshield wiper is dangerous to a point that it’s actually prohibited in a lot of states, and anyone who’s still driving a vehicle without the wipers can be fined.


That is why I highly recommend you to read the buyer’s guide at the end of the article.

Bosch is a company that has participated in the manufacturing of a lot of amazing products.


So, when we first heard that they make wiper blades for vehicles too, we were generally excited to check those out because why not.


The model we are taking a look at today is known as the 26A ICON; now do keep in mind that the number in the model number is basically the size of the wiper blade; so this one is 26 inch, although, Bosch is offering the same amazing wiper blade in multiple sizes.


For those wondering about the sizes that are available, the Bosch Icon comes in 13″ to 24″ and 26″ Needless to say, Bosch has made sure that they are offering the wiper blades in the majority of sizes.


Now when it comes to choosing a specific wiper blade, people need some convincing mainly because there’s always a cheaper option available. The reason you should buy this wiper blade is rather simple, this one actually comes with some of the best features that we are going to discuss right now.


According to official statement from Bosch, the Icon wiper blade comes with dual rubber lining that prevents a lot of the issues that are normally found in other windshield wipers; for starters, the Bosh 26A Icon, as well as all the other Bosh windshield wipers, are made out of FX dual rubber, ensuring that you won’t hear any chattering noises. This also ends up increasing the lifespan for about 40 percent.


While at first, we thought that this is a gimmick, but upon proper testing, we realized that it’s actually not, and the 26A Icon is actually that good. The wiper also comes with a bracketless design, and while it may raise some concerns for some people, it’s actually really good because having this sort of design prevents the snow or ice from building up.


The wiper blades are also equipped with dual steel springs, ensuring that a proper, uniform force is applied across the entire wiper blade. While this may sound like a gimmick to some, it’s actually very useful as it increases the overall lifespan of the wiper blade.


Last but not the least, we also realized that the wiper happens to be very, very quiet during the operation, something that is very useful for people who don’t like the additional noise that most wipers are known for creating.


Overall, there’s no denying that the Bosch Icon series of wipers is amazing; sure, it can be a bit on the expensive side, but by spending all this money, you’re getting some really great wiper blades that will complement your vehicle and clean the windshield a lot better than the stock one.




Pros




 Simple design


 Great, sturdy build quality


 Easy to install


 Longer life span








Cons

We are now taking a look at a really amazing windshield wiper blade from a company known as Valeo, now for those who don’t know, Valeo is basically a company known for creating some of the finest windshield blades that are available in the market, however, a lot of people often overlook the company’s brilliant range of windshield wipers that are available to the consumers.

When it comes to new wiper blades, a lot of people prefer OEM blades because they believe that the quality is always better, and while that’s not always the truest of things, it can be true if you’re comparing some really bad ones to the OEM ones.


For those who don’t know, OEM basically means “original equipment manufacturer”, and in this case, OEM level wiper blades basically mean that your car’s manufacturer manufactured the wiper blades as well.


Today, we are looking at Aero OEM Premium wiper blades for a variety of vehicles, now for those who don’t know, Aero is one of the OEM companies that create some of the best wiper blades for different vehicle manufacturers.


The Aero OEM Premium wiper blades are made out of specially blended rubber that stands really well against all the hard work that gets done by the wipers, the wipers are designed with aerodynamics in mind, and for those who don’t know, this means that during the usage, there will be comparatively lesser drag, and at the same time lesser amount of noise that will be introduced.


In addition to that, in order to make sure there’s no dust, ice, or snow stuck to the inside of the wiper, the company has designed these wipers without any exposed metal parts, this means that your whole experience will go a lot smoother.


You should also know that the specially blended rubber also helps with cleaning your windshield without leaving any bad looking streaks behind, something that is a legit problem a lot of people face because streams look terrible on windshields or any type of glass for that matters.

 Easy to install


 Sturdy build quality

RainEater G3
 – Best High Quality All-Seasons Wipers




I came across the RainEater brand nearly a year ago and, after a winter of freezing rain, snow, and constant frosts, I’ve become a loyal customer of these all-weather wiper blades.


The RainEater Wiper Blade G3 isn’t just another beam-style wiper blade; RainEaters are used by storm chasers and professionals in the aerospace industry. If thrill seekers and scientists alike use these to hunt down Kansan tornadoes, then I know I’ll never be in a situation to challenge the abilities of these wipers to keep my windshield clean.


Features


The RainEater Wiper Blade G3 is a frameless wiper blade (
short youtube video on Frameless vs Traditional Wiper Blades
) with a stylish, low-profile design that offers a quiet, streak-free wiping experience. Unlike traditional, framed wipers – that have a lot of exposed parts that hold the wiper flat against the windshield – frameless wipers have a more streamlined construction that allows the wiper blade to fit directly on the windshield arm. This is great in several ways. First, it makes the whole process of installation easy. Second, fewer parts means that it’s less prone to wear and tear. And third, the frameless construction makes the wiping action more even which reduces streaking and improves visibility during downpours.


Its excellent, all-weather performance – coupled with the EZ-Quick installation – makes this wiper blade ideal for cars and trucks of all makes and models. It comes with a universal connector that fits a wide variety of vehicles. When I bought one for my truck, I didn’t have to stop at a garage to ask a mechanic about the installation. Nor did I have to spend half an hour puzzling over tiny, Tetris-like pieces until I figured out what went where. Installation is easy and takes just seconds. I didn’t even have to find a screwdriver!


RainEaters offer all-season performance. I changed out my blades in early autumn and didn’t have to worry about changing them when the first snows came just a couple of months later. Since they lack many of the joints and parts of traditional wiper blades, ice and snow don’t pile up on the blade and affect its performance.


RainEaters are more streamlined and aerodynamic than traditional wipers, too. This allows the blades to hug the windshield even at the fastest speeds or, for anyone brave enough to chase storms, in the worst weather. And drivers who pride themselves on the sporty look of their car will appreciate the aesthetic – not to mention additional performance – of a more aerodynamic wiper blade.


Be sure to get RainEater 
from manufacturer’s website
 – not from other retailers.  For example, at the time of writing, Amazon sellers were selling old and expired products under RainEaters name, and these potentially could have some defects. RainEater does not have an Amazon store.


Product Quality


The first thing I noticed when I took my RainEater out of its box was the sturdiness of its construction. The rubber element is tight and the plastic spine is firm, making it super durable. The blade bends flexibly when subjected to force but retains the curved shape it needs to form properly to the windscreen. I bought mine nearly a year ago, and it still looks and performs like it’s brand new.


Packaging/Unboxing


Similar to other wipers that are available in my local auto store, the RainEater Wiper Blade comes in a long, narrow, cardboard case with a clear plastic cover. The blade is exposed on the plastic side and I could visually inspect it before I took it home.


However, I liked the curved box that makes RainEater’s packaging unique and elegant. Unlike other packages that squeeze a curved blade into a rectangular box, this special packaging forms around the wiper, helping it to keep its curved shape while it’s in its packaging. The rubber blade is further protected by a vivid green sleeve to prevent any damage during transportation.


Installation Instructions


I loved that the package came with clearly printed installation directions on the back. It has a four-step diagram for different compatibilities like side lock, bayonet, top lock (1 and 2), and hook type. I found the pictures quite easy to understand, and the instructions are simple and straightforward.


What I liked


Other than the quality and practicality of this wiper blade, I appreciate that the universal, all-in-one adaptor allows me to use it on both our family’s cars as well as my truck. Their advertisement claims they fit 97 percent of wiper arms available on the market. I can only say they fit all of my cars. And again, it comes with a plastic hatch that hides the vehicle’s wiper arm from the effects of rain, snow, and heat damage.


What I did not like


Unfortunately, some arrows on the box’s installation guide appear translucent and may prove confusing to follow as they blend into the wiper sketches. I didn’t have any trouble with it, but I could see where other people might (while writing this, I looked at their website; they have 2-minutes videos that also show the installation process… so maybe this gripe isn’t all that important).


As simple and straightforward as I found the installation to be, I would caution anyone against being overzealous in trying to force RainEaters on. Using too much pressure when wedging and yanking the hook into position might break the adapter.




Pros




 Easy to install


 All-in-one adapter that fits a wide range of vehicles wiper arms


 All-seasons application


 Performs great in heavy rains








Cons




 Arrows in the installation manual tend to camouflage the wiper sketches


 Sometimes squeaks in light rains

Trico Force

Last update on 2023-05-21 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








We are closing in on our list, and we still have some of the best windshield wipers that we are planning on looking at. Right now, we are looking at this amazing wiper blade that is aptly named Trico Force. Now unlike some of the previous wiper blades that we have reviewed so far, the name doesn’t really represent anything, and while the indecisive nature may make some people raise their eyebrows, it shouldn’t be enough for others to judge these wiper blades unfairly.


Now the good thing here is that these wiper blades are available in a variety of different sizes, so even if you happen to have a vehicle with a different windshield than the conventional design, you should be at ease knowing that you won’t be running into issues such as compatibility or improper finishing.


In case you are wondering about the type of material that is used in the manufacturing of these windshield wipers, you should know that these are made out of HighGlide Treated Rubber, and the reason why this rubber proves to be really good is because it allows the windshield blade to easily glide and slide on the windshield without really causing a lot of drag, or creating unpleasant noise.


The entire wiper is made out of high-quality material and doesn’t leave out any of the structure exposed, meaning that nothing can get stuck inside the structure and cause issues. This is something that we see a lot in most high-end wiper blades that are largely available in the market.


The wiper uses an amazing method of attachment that minimizes the amount of effort that it may take and maximizes the priority, making sure that you don’t have a hard time installing these wipers onto your vehicle’s windshield.


Overall, for anyone who wants a wide variety of sizes to choose from, the decision of going with Trico Force isn’t a bad one at all; the windshield wiper is available in a variety of different sizes, are really, really easy to install, and hold up really well against the majority of different weathers. Needless to say, the Trico Force are easily one of the best wiper blades out in the market at the moment.




Pros




 Available in different sizes


 Can be easily replaced


 Suitable for all the weathers








Cons




 Can only be installed on the original mounting points of the vehicle

PIAA Super Silicone

Last update on 2023-05-21 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








PIAA Super Silicone is not a really charming name for a windshield wiper or for any product for that matters, however, it doesn't mean that we won't be testing it in order to find out whether or not the windshield wiper we're looking at is actually good enough to be on this list.


Well, since it's already on the list, the cat's out of the bag, and you are already reading what we have to say about the windshield wiper. Now while the name isn't super creative, this windshield blade is a company that believes that going simple is the best way to actually make the most of their product.


Upon receiving the review sample, we were told that this windshield blade is made from specially patented silicone rubber, and while not many details were given to us, we were told that this patented silicon rubber will ensure that the silicone manages to resist against all the wears and tears as well as all the damage that can be caused by UV rays.


Believe it or not, UV rays from the sun are really damaging to the rubber and considering how you are someone who tends to drive a lot, or your car stays out more than it should, it's not something of a smart decision in the first place.


The windshield blade is available in the majority of sizes in order to make the experience a lot easier for you, and it doesn't matter what the windshield of your vehicle requires, there is a solution available for you.


The whole wiper blade is made in such a way that even when the silicone wipes itself off of the windshield, there are absolutely no streaks left behind. Do keep in mind that streaks are something that can be very annoying, and this silicone rubber makes sure that the whole existence of streaks is completely taken care of.




To be really honest, we didn't expect this windshield blade to do a lot of work, mainly because we never really heard much about this company. However, the good thing is that this brand left us surprised, and in awe.


Overall, the performance of these blades proved to be one of the best in class, and they were really easy to install.


The construction was also solid, making them one of the best windshield wipers that are currently available in the market for the consumer to buy without really facing any issues like stock running out. This is because these are pretty famous actually, and the stocks are always available to ship out as soon as possible.






Pros




 Enough sizes to meet all the requirements


 Straightforward installation without any hassle whatsoever


 Great frame that’s sturdy and lightweight








Cons




 None

ACDelco Metal

Last update on 2023-05-21 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








We just have to more wiper blades left on our list to review and we will be done. Now generally when we are looking at the end of the least, we are usually taking a look at some of the items that are less impressive. However, here at 10Beasts we normally follow a different rule that ensures that each and every single product in our list can be considered the best out of the respective type of product we are looking at.


With that out of the way, say hello to the ACDelco Metal, another decisively named windshield wiper that made us skeptical in the beginning but thanks to the consistent performance, it somehow managed to make it to the list.


Now before we begin and get into the details, we would like to actually take a look at some of the concerns that made us reluctant while reviewing this set of wiper blades. For starters. The wiper blades don't really come in a different size, they have one size, and to our surprise, we weren't even told.


Luckily, the size managed to be the most standard with sedans, and the wiper blades fit in perfectly. Now do keep in mind that the product page suggested that this is actually made entirely out of metal and while this may raise some big concerns, and some eyebrows as well, the good thing is that the entire metal structure is covered.


In case you don't know, the covered structure is really good because by the approach, it's really easy for the exposed structure to have debris stuck in it, and stuck debris can completely destroy the wiper blade, that's why we should always ignore the wiper blades because if not, then we're only getting ourselves in a rut.


Overall, the ACDelco Metal is a really good wiper blade that you can buy right now, sure, there are some shortcomings like not having multiple sizes available, not giving some proper information about the product on the product page.


If you are okay with these shortcomings, then the good thing is ACDelco Metal isn't really a bad windshield wiper, as a matter of fact, it's great, and in majority of cases, it works just as intended. So, you can simply go ahead and make the purchase without really facing any issues.




Pros




 Really cheap


 Simple installation


 High quality material








Cons




 Not a lot of information on the page

The last product on our list is the Michelin Stealth Hybrid, and while most of the people will be impressed by the name just like we did, the true question is whether or not this wiper blade lives up to the name. Well, if you want the shorter answer, then the answer is yes.


However, if you want a longer, proper answer, then you should keep reading because we are going to reveal some of the best bits about this windshield wiper blade. For starters, the Michelin Stealth Hybrid is available in a variety of different sizes, and this is really good for people who really don't want to struggle with finding the right fit for your vehicle.


You can simply confirm it with your vehicle's vendor, if you're getting it online, you can check it through the handy compatibility tool that is usually available on the product pages. Now moving on, Michelin has decided to keep things safe and simple and decided to go with rubber installation, and while some people may turn away from this, the good thing here is that rubber is actually the best material used in the construction of the best windshield wipers.


Another good thing is how the wiper has been designed, Michelin made sure that the design is as practical as possible, and even if it's curved, it will fit really, really well. Not to forget, the windshield wipers come with a rather easy to understand locking mechanism.


The mechanism itself is really easy to operate, and apart from that, you can simply install it yourself. This means that you won't have to hassle around with the wipers, and that's a positive point. In addition to that, the overall build quality is rather nice, and the wiper blades are covered so that will prevent anything getting inside the structure and potentially destroying the blades.


Overall, the Michelin Stealth Hybrid is a really well thought out wiper blade that does a lot of good things, the fact that Michelin decided to with simplicity rather than using fancy terms that won't make sense to a lot of people only tells that the company has confidence in the product that they have created.




Pros




 Good value for money


 A variety of sizes available


 Easy installation

Windshield Wipers - Buyers Guide


Now when it comes to windshield wipers, they are mostly constructed out of flexible metal along with some sort of rubber coating on top of it to prevent it from getting damaged early. Now, these windshield wipers use different kind of blades that are used to clean the windshield (and complement your 
car vacuum cleaner
 in maintaining your vehicle).


Keep in mind that when we say blades, we basically mean that we are not talking about steel or metal blades, instead, these blades are made out of softer material that can't really damage the windshield when wiped on it.


In order to avoid any confusions, we are going to name the most commonly used windshield blades that are installed in these windshield wipers. So, without further ado, let's take a look.


Rubber Blades
Silicone Blades
Coated Blades


Perhaps the most common type of material that is used in these wipers is rubber, the rubber blades are common because they are easy to find and really easy and inexpensive to manufacture. Now keep in mind that due to the fact that rubber is cheap and can degrade based on the intensity of usage, rubber blades are often the first ones to give up.


However, that doesn't mean the rubber wiper blades are bad by any measure. As a matter of fact, a lot of car manufacturers are putting rubber wiper blades into their cars. So, make sure that you don't just go ahead and buy some other material just because someone told you that rubber blades get easily ruined.


Just keep in mind that rubber blades aren't created to last long and will require you to change them every now and then, but the good thing is that they are cheap and you can change them every now and then without really going through much of a hassle.




The technology has progressed somewhat and we now have silicone wiper blades, and for those who don't know, silicone wiper blades are a lot more durable than rubber wiper blades, however, at the same time, silicone costs a bit more than rubber.


Apart from the cost and durability, one more thing that is important to know is that silicone wiper blades are not easy to form and craft, that's why not a lot of wiper manufacturers are bringing these wipers in just yet.


However, at the same time, the good thing is that the companies that are bringing these wipers in are receiving some great critical and commercial reception. Unlike rubber, silicone doesn't really get dried off in different seasons, this means that while rubber blades last shorter, the silicon blades last longer.


The only difference here is that the silicone blades are just slightly more expensive, but considering how you won't have to change them every now and then, it's completely justifiable. Also, another thing to keep in mind is that these type of blades are commonly used in sports cars as well as off-road vehicles that are subjected to a lot of force.


However, the good thing is that most manufacturers have started making the same blades for standard cars that are available to the common folk as well.




Coated blades are also the type of windshield blades that are becoming more and more common, and instead of changing the rubber for some other material, they are actually just coated on top of the rubber to make it last longer.


Now in case you are wondering, rubber is coated with materials like Teflon or graphite, and while that may seem like a bad idea but it's not. Instead of the rubber touching the surface of the windshield, it's usually the coated material, and this creates a small amount of resistance that's barely noticeable if at all.


However, the real benefit here is that thanks to the Teflon or graphite coating, the rubber's overall lifespan becomes a lot longer than it usually is. Plus, another great thing here is that even if the rubber ends up drying out, the coating remains as good, and doesn't wear out that fast.


Graphite and Teflon coated wiper blades are certainly a bit more expensive, but this approach can save you some money in the longer run because that way you won't have to really change the wiper blades again and again. This is something you should definitely consider.


Before you go ahead and purchase wiper for your vehicle, we would suggest you do some research, and the reason why this research is important is because if you don't do it, you may end up getting the wrong wiper that may not work at all with the vehicle you own.


Few things about wiper blades which you must be aware of!


Now there are a lot of best wiper blades available in the market, and a lot of people think that they are universal and will fit on almost all the vehicles there are. However, the truth is different as they use different mounting mechanisms.


So, in order to make sure that your buying experience isn't as terrible as it could become, we are going to take a look at some of the things you should know before buying windshield wipers.


Without further ado, let's take a look, shall we?


Size of the Wiper Blades
Types of Stock Wiper Blade
Warranty and Maintenance


The first thing you need to know is the size of the wiper blade that is installed on your vehicle's windshield, this is important because if you are in the market for an aftermarket wiper blade, you're going to need a wiper blade with the same size as the stock one, otherwise there can be some issues with compatibility or installation.


For those who don't know, the simplest way to determine the blade size is by looking at the size of your windshield, blade sizes are just a little smaller than the windshields so you'll get the idea. Another thing that you should keep in mind that the blades that are installed on the driver side are different in size as compared to the blades that are installed on the passenger side.


This may seem odd to some, but this design difference is mainly to make sure that both of the blades can work in tandem when activated. If the blades are of the same size, they'll actually collide when both are turned on at the same time.


Similarly, if you are looking for a blade that goes into the rear window, it will be somewhat smaller than the blades on the windshield due to the size difference.






Another thing you should know the type of stock wiper blade; this is the information that will be used as a reference. Now when it comes to wiper blades, they are either available in beam styles, or bracket styles. It should be made clear that a bracket style blade won't work on the mounting system that is for beam style, and vice-versa.


One should also know what type of attachments they in order to make the whole buying experience a lot easier. Having all of this information at hand will ultimately help you make sure that your whole experience goes smoothly as possible, and for some weird reason you don't end up with the wrong wiper blade.






The general rule is that the windshield wiper blades don't come with any warranty, even if you're buying from the best windshield wiper blades, chances are that they don't have any warranty with them. This means that if they end up malfunctioning, you will have to buy new ones.


However, the good thing is that through some proper maintenance, you can actually increase the longevity of these blades. You can do some proper maintenance, and occasional inspections to make sure that there's no debris or other junk stuck in the blades.


The reason we are talking about debris here is because it is pretty common for these windshield wiper blades to have some sort of debris in them especially if you live in an area that is usually covered in dust, or you drive out a lot.


Simply make sure, and if you find any debris, clear it with some water, and the wipers will be back to normal again. Ignoring this debris can cause the wiper to jam, and in extreme situations, even break.


Now that the readers finally have some information on the wipers, and some things that they should look out for, we can finally go ahead and take a look at the best windshield wipers that are available in the market. So, without further ado, let's review the ten best windshield blades we have.




Conclusion - Wrapping it up


So, there you have it, folks! We tested some of the best windshield wipers available in the market at the moment. While do keep in mind that we just covered 10 because that's how things normally work, the market won't treat you the same way.


There are hundreds of windshield wipers available in the market, and as a consumer, it's up to you to choose. However, making mistakes is easy, and especially when you're going to buy something like a windshield wiper that most of the people don't have proper information about.


Well, don't worry, the guide is here to help you pick the best out of the best windshield wipers are available in the market. We hope that you have a pleasant time picking the right wiper for your needs, and in case you face any trouble while picking up the right windshield wiper for yourself, it's okay because you can always get in touch with us and we'll help you with the right decision.

Small but mighty, this is one of the best car vacuums since it has a powerful 120-watt motor, which allows for extra strong suction power. Most handheld car vacs are 80 watts or less.


This vacuum was specifically made to clean any car and to do so more easily than others on the market. You are able to use this to clean wet or dry messes, and it won’t cause any issues. 
There is a longer power cord on this vac, allowing you to reach all of the places in your vehicle that need cleaning.


Like most other car vacuums on this list, it is equipped with a removable HEPA filter so you can reuse and easily clean when needed and extend the life of the filter.

If you’re looking for a smaller vacuum that packs a punch, consider purchasing this last vac.


With a 120-watt motor, it will be hard to find a handheld vacuum that can compete with the suction power this one carries. And with the warranty, you will be covered if you feel like you don’t like your purchase within the first year. Lastly, there are multiple attachments, making any cleaning job easier.

Buying Guide


Standard Features


Now that you’ve read what you need to consider before purchasing a vacuum for your car, there are some additional standard features to know about that should come with each vacuum. You want a vacuum that, if cordless, can hold a long battery charge and doesn’t have a suction that fades in power over the course of using it.


Another standard feature can be a reusable filter, which not only makes for easier clean up for you, but is also good for the earth and your wallet.


Cordless




Having a cordless vacuum is the ultimate convenience. You are able to physically get into your vehicle and reach every spot you’re wanting to clean. There isn’t a long cord to work around and avoid tripping over.


Having a cordless vacuum means that when charged, it’s portable. You’ll be able to keep it in your car and use it daily or whenever an unexpected mess is created.


Battery Life




Having a long battery life pertains to cordless vacuums, since you won’t receive your power from being consistently plugged into a power source. A long battery life means you won’t have to stop vacuuming part-way through to charge your vacuum.


Suction Power


Suction power is one of the main selling points of vacuums, whether you’re using it in your car or elsewhere. If a vacuum has poor suction, it will take more work on your end to get the mess cleaned and usually will take more time as well.


In addition to having powerful suction, you may want to make sure that it doesn’t fade over time. If you’ve ever been using a cordless vacuum and notice that it starts out strong but towards the end of the battery charge, it starts to fade in power. You will see a few vacuums that have a longer, fade-resistant life than others in the reviews below.




Easy To Clean


Having a vacuum that is easy to clean after use is half the battle. In the reviews below, you will see how easy each vacuum is to clean and what that will entail. Most of them have reusable filters and dirt trays that you can clean with soap and water at your kitchen sink.


Additional Features


You might be looking at features that don’t come standard on most car vacuums. These reviews are convenient since there are such a variety of product features.


One of the most popular additional features is a wet/dry capability. A lot of these vacuums come with that, but not all, so read carefully.


Lastly, not every vacuum comes with additional brushes and tools, but we cover which ones on the list do and what those tools are.


Conclusion


After going over the top 10 best car vacuums, you should be well versed on the main and additional features that most vacuums have. Whether you prefer a cordless vacuum that’s easier to clean or one that you mount to the wall with a large dirt trap that you’ll have to clean less often, there’s likely something on this list for you.


Whether you’re cleaning up after pets and children, you work for a ride sharing company and need a tidy car, or you’re just looking for something to clean up every day dirt and dust, there’s a car vac on the market for any of your needs.

Vacuuming your car is only one of the steps to ensure a pleasant riding experience. After you make your vehicle nice and tidy, you might want to consider giving it a pleasant aroma by using an air freshener or something more intense, like a portable diffuser. However, this is a much wider topic that we will discuss at a different time.


Now that you know about car vacs, it’s time you get to

, both of which are really helpful if your vehicle breaks down.

Camping is the perfect way to get out into nature and enjoy some quality time with friends and family. But, in order to make sure your camping trip is as fun and stress-free as possible, it’s important to make sure you have all of the necessary supplies.


From tents and sleeping bags, to food and first aid kits, there are a lot of items that need to be packed before heading off on your adventure.


To help ensure you don’t forget anything essential for your camping trip, we’ve compiled this ultimate checklist of everything you’ll need for an unforgettable outdoor experience!


Why Do I Need A Camping Checklist?


A 
camping checklist
 is a great way to ensure that you have everything you need for a safe and enjoyable camping trip.


Having a comprehensive list of items to bring will help you avoid forgetting something important, and it can also remind you to take extra supplies in case of unexpected needs or changes in plans.


Taking a few minutes to go over your checklist before leaving for your camping trip can save you time and hassle during the trip.


Camping Essentials


Camping essentials are items that you need to make sure you have before heading out on a camping trip.


These items include things like your tent, sleeping bag, cooking supplies and gear, clothing, first aid kit, and some form of shelter or protection from the elements.


Depending on where you are camping and what activities you plan to do while there, you may also need items such as a camping stove and fuel, compass, knife, and other tools.


When packing for a camping trip, it is important to think through all the supplies you will need and plan accordingly.


Consider what type of shelter you may need, such as a tent or an RV if you plan on doing extended camping trips.


Also, bring enough food and water for the duration of your trip as well as a first aid kit in case of any accidents or injuries along the way.


When it comes to clothing for camping, make sure you have appropriate items that will provide both warmth and protection from insects.


You should also consider bringing some form of light source. This could be a flashlight or lantern, depending on your needs and the type of camping trip you are going on.


Last but not least, don’t forget to bring items like sunscreen, insect repellent, and any other necessary items that may be relevant to your camping destination.


Cooking Supplies


Depending on the size of your group and how much time you intend to spend outdoors, you may need a variety of items for cooking.


At a minimum, consider bringing: matches or a lighter; cookware such as pots and pans; utensils including knives and spatulas; plates, cups and eating utensils; a camp stove; fuel for your stove or charcoal for the fire; paper towels, aluminum foil and plastic wrap; coolers and ice packs to keep food cold.


If you’re cooking over a campfire, bring a wire grilling basket, long-handled tongs and roasting sticks.


And don’t forget your 
favorite recipes
. For easy meals, pack freeze-dried and dehydrated food. They’re lightweight and easy to prepare.


Safety And Hygiene Gear


Having the right safety and hygiene items can make a huge difference in your comfort level while out in the wilderness.


This includes items like fire extinguishers, first aid kits, emergency whistles, flashlights and headlamps, maps or compasses, insect repellent, sunscreen, and life jackets. These items will help you stay safe and comfortable on your camping trip.


Having the right hygiene products such as soap, shampoo, toothpaste, and toilet paper can help you keep clean while outdoors.


Don’t forget to also bring trash bags to store all of your waste so that it can be disposed of properly when you arrive back home.


Entertainment Options


When you’re camping, there are 
plenty of entertainment options
 to choose from. From playing board games to going on hikes and exploring nature, there are countless activities you can do while enjoying the great outdoors.


Other popular outdoor activities include bike riding, fishing, swimming, kayaking, canoeing, rock climbing and more.


If you’d like to bring a bit of technology with you, consider bringing along a portable speaker or video game console.


Camping is also a great time to read books and enjoy some much-needed alone time.


Above all else, make sure to take in the beauty of nature and relax.


Tips For Being Comfortable While Camping






The fact that you are out in nature doesn’t mean that you should be uncomfortable. Here are some tips to make your camping experience more pleasurable.


Bring Enough Layers


It can get cold at night outdoors, so make sure you have plenty of warm layers like sweaters and jackets.


Also bring items that provide insulation such as sleeping bags and blankets.


Choose Your Campsite Wisely


Be sure to pick a spot that is sheltered from the elements and away from potential hazards.


Invest In A Good Tent


Make sure your tent is large enough to fit all of your camping gear and comfortable for sleeping.


Also consider the weather conditions you may come across during your trip when making your selection.


Utilize Natural Resources


If possible, try to use natural resources such as firewood or running water to make your camping experience more comfortable.


Bring A First-Aid Kit


It’s always a good idea to have a well-stocked first-aid kit on hand in case of emergencies and minor medical needs.


Invest In Quality Gear And Supplies


Quality camping gear and supplies will help make your camping experience more enjoyable and comfortable.


Be sure to read reviews before investing in new gear.


Stay Hydrated


Make sure you bring enough water for your trip and stay hydrated throughout the day by drinking plenty of fluids.


Bring A Good Flashlight Or Headlamp


A good flashlight or headlamp is essential for navigating your way around and setting up camp in the dark. Investing in a good one will be worth it in the long run.


Bring Insect Repellent


Depending on where you are camping, insects can be a nuisance and even dangerous. Be sure to bring insect repellent to keep them away.


Extra Clothing And Footwear


Having extra clothing and footwear is essential when camping. Even if the weather is good, you should always be prepared for any drastic changes in temperature or unforeseen precipitation.


It’s a good idea to bring multiple layers of clothing so you can easily adjust them depending on your level of comfort.


You should also consider bringing rain gear and waterproof shoes in case it rains.


Wearing sandals or flip-flops is a great way to stay comfortable around the campsite and give your feet some air.


Having extra clothing and footwear will ensure that you’re always prepared for any eventuality during your camping trip.


Final Word


Having a comprehensive camping checklist is essential for any outdoor adventure. With the right gear, you can make sure your trip goes off without a hitch and that you are prepared to handle whatever nature throws at you.


Whether it’s packing extra water or bringing an emergency shelter, having these items on hand will help ensure an enjoyable experience in the wilderness.


Remember to always check local laws and regulations before leaving home so that you don’t run into unexpected surprises while out exploring!

How to Choose the Right Camping Stove,https://10beasts.com/camping-stove/,"

Camping is a great way to get away from it all and enjoy nature. But in order to make the most of your camping experience, you need to have the right equipment – especially when it comes to your cooking needs.


Choosing the right camping stove for your trip can be tricky, as there are many different types available on the market today.


From propane stoves to wood-burning stoves, each has its own advantages and disadvantages that should be carefully considered before making a purchase.


Types of Camping Stoves


When choosing the right camping stove, it’s important to consider the type of stove that you need for your intended use.


There are several different types of camping stoves available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.


Canister Stove


Canister camp stoves are lightweight and easy to use.


They’re powered by a canister of fuel that is screwed onto the bottom of the stove.


Canister camp stoves are great for backpackers and those looking for an easy, lightweight cooking solution.


Liquid Fuel Stove


Liquid fuel stoves are powerful and capable of boiling water quickly.


They generally require more maintenance than other types of camping stoves, but they can also be used with different fuel sources, making them a great choice for long trips.


Wood-burning Stove


Wood-burning stoves are the most traditional type of camping stove and require no fuel source other than wood for fuel.


They’re usually more reliable than liquid or gas stoves and can provide an outdoor cooking experience that is hard to match.


Solar Ovens


Solar ovens are one of the most efficient ways to cook outdoors since they require no fuel source other than the sun’s energy.


They can be used for a variety of cooking needs and don’t require any setup or maintenance, making them ideal for longer trips.


The best camping stove for you will depend on your needs and preferences. Consider the fuel source, weight, type of cooking you’ll be doing and any unique features that might help make your trip more enjoyable.


With so many options available, choosing the right camping stove can be a daunting task but it doesn’t have to be.


Proper research and consideration of all the factors involved in choosing a camping stove can help you make an informed decision and find the perfect camping stove for your outdoor needs.


Features to Consider When Choosing a Camping Stove






When choosing the right camping stove, it is important to consider a variety of factors.


The size, fuel type, and weight of the stove all play a large role in its efficiency and usability while out in the wilderness.


Other thoughtful features such as portability, wind protection, simmer control, and ignition source should be taken into account.


Fuel type


Camping stoves typically use 
propane or butane
 fuel types.


Think about which type of fuel you’ll have access to when out on the trail and what would be easiest to transport.


Size and Weight


Make sure the stove is light enough to carry for your camping trip.


If you’ll be backpacking, you’ll want something light and compact that can fit into the space available in your pack.


Burns


Consider how many people will be using the stove to determine how many burners it needs.


Some models have two or three burners, while others may have up to six.


Pot Supports


Look for a camping stove with pot supports that can accommodate the size of your cooking pots or pans.


Boil Time


A faster boiling time means you won’t have to wait long for water to boil, so consider how fast the stove heats up when choosing one.


Ignition


Ensure that the stove comes with an easy way to light it, such as an electric or manual ignition system.


Other Features


Some camping stoves come with extras, such as windscreens, pressure regulators, and Piezo ignitions for added convenience and durability. 


Price


Look for a stove that fits your budget and will provide you with the features you need.


With careful consideration of these factors, you can find the right camping stove which suits your needs and make sure you have an enjoyable outdoor experience.


Make sure to always follow safety instructions when using a camping stove to avoid any injuries or accidents.


Once you’ve chosen the right camping stove, you can begin planning your next outdoor adventure.


Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Fuel Sources






When it comes to selecting a camping stove, there are several fuel sources to choose from. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to understand the different options before choosing the right one for your needs.


Propane Stoves


Propane stoves are a popular choice because they are easy to use and reliable. They also require little maintenance and are available at most stores.


The main disadvantage of using a propane stove is that they require canisters filled with pressurized fuel, which can be difficult to find in remote areas.


Liquid Fuel


Liquid fuel stoves are another option and offer a longer burn time than propane stoves. However, the liquid fuel tanks can be bulky, and it can take longer to heat up a meal.


Liquid fuel stoves require regular maintenance and may present an environmental hazard if not disposed of properly.


Wood-Burning Stoves


They are the most basic form of camping stove and don’t require any fuel tanks or cartridges. However, these types of stoves have a limited cooking time and may require extra effort to keep fueled.


They 
create more smoke
 than other types of stoves, so they must be used with adequate ventilation in order to avoid smoke inhalation.


Finally, campers can also consider using a combination stove which can use multiple fuel sources and provide the convenience of switching between different options.


These types of stoves are often more expensive, but they can also be a great investment if you plan to camp in different environments.


Tips for Use and Care of Camping Stove


Now that we’ve purchased our stove, we must learn how to take proper care of it.


Here are some tips for use and care of camping stoves:


Read the Instructions


Before using your camping stove, make sure to read and understand all of the manufacturer’s instructions regarding setup, use, and maintenance.


Knowing how to properly operate and care for your stove will ensure it runs safely and efficiently each time you use it.


Set up Outdoors


Always set up and use your camping stove outdoors, away from any combustible materials.


Make sure you are in an open area with good ventilation to avoid the possibility of carbon monoxide buildup.


Check for Leaks


Before using your stove, do a quick check for any gas or fuel leaks at all connection points.


If you notice any, refrain from using the stove and have it serviced or repaired before use.


Refuel Outdoors


Always refuel your camping stove outside and away from any open flames or heat sources.


Make sure to close the fuel valve when not in use, as well as when refueling, to avoid fire hazards.


Use a Windbreak


A windbreak can be used to protect your camping stove from being blown out by the wind.


Windbreaks come in a variety of shapes and sizes, so make sure you choose one that best fits your needs.


Keep it Clean


Make sure to routinely clean and inspect your camping stove after each use.


This will help ensure that it is running safely and efficiently, and will help extend the life of your camping stove.


Dispose of Fuel Correctly


After each use, make sure to 
properly dispose
 of any unused fuel from your camping stove.


Fuel containers can be hazardous if not disposed of correctly, so take care to follow all safety guidelines.


By following these tips for use and care, your camping stove should be safe to use and will last you many happy camping trips.


And don’t forget: always practice campfire safety when using a camping stove!


Final Word


No matter what type of camping stove you choose, the most important thing is to make sure it meets your needs and that you know how to use it properly.


With a little research and consideration, you can find the perfect camping stove for your next outdoor adventure.


Make sure to read up on safety protocols when using any kind of camp stove so that everyone stays safe while enjoying nature’s beauty.


Once you have chosen the right one for yourself, all that’s left is packing and getting ready to hit the trails!

The Need for the Fastest Hoverboard,https://10beasts.com/fastest-hoverboard/,"



Before we begin, I would like to mention that some parts of this article are designed to be read in an epic voice, so proceed at your own risk.


Some might consider fast hoverboards a danger or an accident waiting to happen, but you know, that’s not entirely true. While there are risks, yes, a device is only dangerous in the hands, or in this case feet, of an inexperienced user. That is why when someone tells me they are looking for the fastest hoverboard, I immediately assume they are already experienced enough. It goes without saying, but I will say it anyway – you should not ride a 12 mph hoverboard if you have never used one before. At least start off slow! 


I get it, you are an adventure seeker – a thrill lover, but I’m sure you know that in this, as in everything else, safety comes first. So if you are someone who is just getting into the hobby, then I would recommend checking out a different review of mine, and when you’ve had a little bit of practice, come back here – I won’t be going anywhere. Here’s a review of  
the best self balancing scooters
.


With that stuff out of the way, we can focus on what’s really important – speed. You see, people have often asked me, “
What is the fastest hoverboard?
” and even though that statement just now was a lie, I am going to give you the answer anyway.


If you are one of those people who have Googled “the fastest hoverboard” or even “fastest hoverboard brand,” you have come to the right place.

Let’s start off our list with a budget hoverboard. The TOMOLOO V2 Eagle may be significantly shepherded than most of our other entries, but that in no way means it’s worse. In fact, this budget hoverboard can compete with the best of the best. 


This particular self-balancing scooter has a simplistic design, inspired by the eagle of the northern grasslands – or so the manufacturer claims. It has a pair of tough rubber wheels that can take you through most terrain, while the dual motor will help you climb a 20-degree incline and push a max speed of 9 mph. However, the range is not great at only 8 miles per charge.


The TOMOLOO hoverboard’s speed might be decent, but its battery is not – far from it actually. With a battery that won’t even last you an hour if you are constantly going at the max speed and a charging time of around 3 hours, you will find yourself waiting for your hoverboard to charge more often than not. Even so, when you use the TOMOLOO hoverboard, it’s a fun and smooth ride. You can also keep an eye out for the battery life via the LED indicator or by simply opening the app. 


There is, of course, a Bluetooth speaker which you can use to blast some good old-fashioned Sabaton or, you know, whatever you like. Not to mention, while you are doing that, you can use the app to make the LED lights on your TOMOLOO hoverboard to pulse and glow with different colors, essentially creating your own disco. You can also add friends on the mobile app, which acts as a sort of hoverboard social media.

The Gyroor F1 Hoverboard has to be the best-looking self-balancing scooter not just on this list but in general. Its design was inspired by the traditional look of Formula 1 cars, hence the name Gyroor F1, and even though I am not a petrol head, far from it actually, I still love this design. However, I understand that some people might find it a bit gimmicky, especially with the race car sounds – yes this hoverboard has race car sound, but don’t worry as you can turn them off anytime you wish.


Other than a solid-looking design, this candidate for the fastest hoverboard has a body made entirely from aluminum as well as giant SUV tires that when put next to the main body look way bigger than they actually are – so not-that-giant SUV tires. However, they are great for most terrain, even gravel and sand. 


What’s more, the Gyroor hoverboard has a 350W dual motor that pushes a max speed of 9.95 mph, and it is capable of climbing a steep 30-degree incline. When you combine that with a range of 9.5 miles, you get a solid hoverboard. While I generally don’t like it when self-balancing scooters have a higher speed than range, this is close enough that I don’t really mind, plus the battery is removable. This means if you ever run out, you can simply change it with another, and when you get back home, you can charge both of them at once. The charging time itself is actually pretty great at around 1–2 hours. You won’t have to wait longer before going out again. Just grab a cup of coffee, and watch a quick movie.


A great feature that I simply love about the Gyroor F1 hoverboard is its Bluetooth speaker. The audio is nice and crisp, and the bass is great as well.


You can also have a mobile app which has two modes, an adult one and a child one, with the child mode limiting the max speed. The adult mode is the proper mode where you can adjust the speed via the app. This is a great feature for someone who is not yet used to hoverboards. The app makes it way easier and sometimes smoother to control.

Here we have the second entry of the Gyroor family. The Gyroor Warrior may not have as unique of a design as the Gyroor F1 but it’s just as good, not to mention that if you are one of those people that think the F1 is too gimmicky, the Warrior is a great alternative.


This candidate for the fastest hoverboard has an aluminum frame, with some UL-approved materials that make it one of the most durable self-balancing scooters out there. 


It also has a pair of 8.5-inch rugged tires that can handle everything from a smooth road to gravel and even sand. As for the 350-watt dual motor, it can push to a max speed of 9.95 mph, same as the F1, as well as climb up a 30-degree incline. With a range of 9.5 miles and a charging time of up to 2 hours, this self-balancing scooter is starting to look more and more like the F1, not to mention that it also has a spare battery, which you can change whenever you want.


You can, of course, keep track of the battery life through the mobile app. You can also control the speed, as well as the color of the LED lights. What’s more, you can even switch between adult and child mode. 


The Gyroor Warrior hoverboard is also waterproof and, of course, UL-certified. The Bluetooth speaker is not as good as on the F1, but it is pretty decent. 


However, I have to say that although this hoverboard is great and there are some variations between it and the F1, it still feels like it was made specifically for people who don’t like the design of the Formula 1-inspired scooter.

At first glance, the FutureSaw Pro Edition might not seem like much. It has a simple design with an admittedly slow speed, and while it’s range is great and all, it’s nothing we haven’t seen before. However, if you look closer and compare the range to the speed, you realize that this hoverboard will last you a long time on a single charge, and frankly speaking, that’s the main reason it’s on this list. 


The hoverboard has an aluminum frame UV-coated casing, making it extremely durable. That is as long as you don’t go past the max weight limit which is 220 lbs, perfect for the average adult. 


The FutureSaw electric scooter also has a pair of 8.5-inch rubber tires, which frankly speaking are not great for off-roading, so maybe you should stick to the smoothly paved road with this one. As for the 350-watt dual motor, it can push to a max speed of 6.2 mph as well as climb up a 30-degree incline. Where this self-balancing scooter truly shines is with its incredible range of 12.4 miles and an amazing charging time of up to 1–1.5 hours. More and more, this hoverboard is beginning to look like it has one of the best batteries out there, and frankly speaking, I might forgive the slow speed. 


As for the Bluetooth speaker, it’s nothing great, but it’s not terrible either. I would give it a rating of 3.6. However, there is no mobile app, so you might miss on some of the more interesting features. Although considering how most hoverboard apps are, this may be a blessing in disguise.


Now, even though this hoverboard is UL-certified, there don’t seem to be any additional safety features, which is a bit of a disappointment.

Now, we have the EPIKGO Premier series, which can be a little bit on the expensive side of things when compared to some of my other entries. In my humble opinion though, the value is well worth the price.


This candidate for the fastest hoverboard has a luxurious design that can either come in gold or gray. It has a pair of 8.5-inch solid rubber tires that are capable of going over any type of terrain, including gravel or sand, in every type of weather. Yes, even on the roughest terrain when it’s raining, you will be able to enjoy a smooth ride. 


The hoverboard has an aluminum frame and an ABS chassis, which can withstand most types of impact. Needless to say, this particular self-balancing scooter is very durable.


The EPIKGO hoverboard has a 400-watt dual motor which is capable of up to 10 mph and can climb a 30-degree incline. Now, we are entering the realm of the faster hoverboards. While 10 mph might not seem like a lot, if you are constantly going at this speed or higher, you might find yourself among the birds at a certain point, so I would advise you to be careful. This is especially true for this particular hoverboard, seeing as it is the fastest accelerating self-balancing scooter on the market.


The battery life is in a league of its own with a range of 12 miles. It will last you well over an hour even if you are constantly going at the max speed. In fact, with such a long battery life, you can start experimenting with your hoverboard – how fast you can go, how slow, and so on. I mean, that’s what I did.


As for the charging time, it’s one the better side of things at 1–2 hours. You can of course keep track of the battery life via the LED indicator or by the mobile app, which to be honest is not the best. In fact it’s not that great at all, but at least you can still blast your favorite tunes via the Bluetooth speaker. 


This hoverboard is of course UL-certified, so you know it’s as safe as it can be. I would definitely recommend this one for anyone searching for a good time.

Now we have the DailySaw which is a big improvement compared to the FutureSaw Pro Edition in almost every aspect. It has an interesting design with rainbowlike colors flowing into one another. When you compare the DailySaw to the EPIKGO Premier, it feels like the former tried as best as it could to surpass its competitor, which is also evidenced by the significantly cheaper price when compared to that of the EPIKGO brand.


Now, this candidate for the fastest hoverboard has an aircraft-grade aluminum alloy chassis – you know, for that extra durability. In fact, I think this makes it one of the most durable on this list. As long as you don’t go over the maximum weight capacity of 220 lbs, your hoverboard will survive most impacts. 


The DailySaw also has a pair of 6.5-inch rubber tires, which are not that great if you want to go hiking, but if you are looking for something to ride around in the neighborhood, you won’t find anything better than this. 


Then there is the 350-watt dual motor which can push to a max speed of 10.5 mph as well as climb up a 20-degree incline, a significant improvement from the FutureSaw. Like the FutureSaw, where this self-balancing scooter truly shines is with its incredible range of 12.5 miles and a charging time of up to 2 hours. While the battery is pretty decent and will last you a long time, the Bluetooth speaker also deserves a mention. 


Although it’s not the best around, it’s still pretty damn good. You can blast your favorite tunes to a crisp audio while making a home disco with the RGB lights mounted on top of both wheels. Sadly, there’s still no mobile app.


When it comes to safety, this hoverboard is UL-certified, and you can buy additional protective bumpers, although I don’t know why you would need them if you’re not going to be riding this off-road.

 Amazing range


 Really durable

Ok, first of all, let’s talk about the elephant in the room. Yes, the Segway Ninebot S Electric Transporter has a unique kind of design. That large stick sticking out of its middle is actually meant to help with stirring. If you are a new hoverboard rider, or even an experienced one, you are definitely familiar with how annoying it is to turn, especially on wide corners. That Segway stick can help you with those pesky sharp turns. You control the ride with your knees, and shift it in the direction you want to go – simple as that, although some people might find it annoying. Despite how it looks, it’s a pretty useful feature that gives you more control and added safety. That’s not all – you can also use it to carry your self-balancing scooter wherever you go. When you are not using it or when you are going down the stairs, you can grab the stick, and use it as a handle. Side note: yes I realize the innuendos here, most of which are not on purposes, but I will ignore all of them.


Moving on, this candidate for the fastest hoverboard has a 400W dual motor that is capable of a max speed of 10 mph as well as an almost 14-mile range, not to mention it can climb up a 15-degree incline. It can handle a maximum weight of 220 lbs, which is perfect for the average adult. While it looks heavy, it’s actually on the lighter side, so you can carry it wherever you go.


Then there is the frankly speaking amazing battery which will last you over an hour if you are constantly going at the maximum speed. The charging time is decent as well.


You can of course track the battery life via the app which has an anti-theft function, a speed sensor, and a self-diagnose and is constantly being updated with new features. Personally, I think this is one of the better apps out there, and if you have seen my 
hoverboard brands
 review, you know how low the bar is set.


When it comes to safety, this self-balancing scooter is of course UL-certified and has a water resistance level of IP54. The battery also has an extra layer of protection. All around, the hoverboard is pretty decent when it comes to safety.

 Great maneuverability


 Good speed

Next up is another one of the Segway brand. Despite its name, the Segway miniPRO is not small in the very least. In fact, this is a beast of a device. Although it’s weight is significantly lower than that of the Ninebot S, it still has the same design with the same rod sticking out in the middle – not to mention an even larger motor.


The stick in the middle, like the one on the Ninebot, is used for extra maneuverability and safety, also in some cases as a handle. Likewise, you have a hoverboard attachment that fits the Segway brand, that stick can act as a steering wheel. If you are confused as to what I am talking about, you probably haven’t seen my review of 
the best hoverboard attachments
.


Other than that, the Segway MiniPro can handle a maximum weight limit of 220 lbs, which makes it perfect for most adults. 


This candidate for the fastest hoverboard has a striking 800-watt dual motor and 10.5” vacuum tires which can take you over any terrain while maintaining their integrity and making for a really smooth ride, not to mention that the hoverboard can also climb a 15-degree slope and push to a max speed of 10 miles per hour. Unfortunately, with a range of 14 miles per charge, I would definitely not recommend pushing this hoverboard to its limits, even if you could, not because something might happen to it, but because something might happen to you – and I am not talking about the hoverboard mafia.


However, with the amazing range and decent speed, you would expect this hoverboard to be a definitive recommendation, but it has it’s problems. While the range is frankly speaking amazing, the charging time is not. This hoverboard will take you around 4 hours to fully charge which is way more than any other on this list, and while when compared to the 14-mile range it might not seem like a lot, it’s still 4 hours, and that’s disappointing. 


Then there is the Bluetooth speaker, which is definitely not the best around, but it will get the job done if you have no other way of listening to music. 


 
 
Pros
 




 Great maneuverability


 Amazing tange


 Great tires




 
 
 
 
Cons

The Swagtron T6 off-road hoverboard has an amazing speed and range. In fact, this is one of the faster hoverboards, not just on this list but in general. If you are looking for the fastest hoverboard out there, this one gets pretty close. Although it has a simple design, it’s actually quite heavy when it comes to the self-balancing scooter, so you will need to be careful that it doesn’t die on you in the middle of nowhere. Worst case, you will have to leave it there.


As for the self-balancing scooter itself, well, there are a pair of 10-inch rubber shock-absorbent tires, which are reinforced with alloy steel and are nylon-infused. They can travel across any terrain, no matter what – gravel, cobblestone, mud, you name it. No matter what, you will enjoy a smooth ride. The hoverboard also has a 300-watt dual motor with a max speed of 12 mph and can push up a 30-degree incline. Now, speaking from experience, while it might not seem like it with those 12 miles per hour, you feel like you are flying through the air, and it can be very exhilarating but also very dangerous, so I don’t recommend it unless you are fully prepared for the consequences.


Other than that, the self-balancing scooter has a maximum range of 12 miles per charge. You can monitor the battery life via the indicator or simply by the mobile app. The charging time is around 2–3 hours which is not ideal, but considering everything else, it is well worth it.


There is a Bluetooth speaker, and you can play your favorite tunes. Arguably, the most impressive feature of this particular hoverboard is the weight capacity. This self-balancing scooter can support adults of up to 420 lbs. I’m just going to let that sink in a bit, and move on.


When it comes to safety, of course, the hoverboard is UL-certified and water-resistant. The battery also has an extra layer of protection thanks to its SentryShield system.

View on Halo Board






The Halo Rover X all-terrain hoverboard is a very luxurious piece of technology, and I am not just talking about the design or the price. This candidate for the fastest hoverboard has top-of-the line tech, both hardware and software, not to mention it will get you where you are going in a precise and stylish manner. 


The Halo Rover X could very well be named the Lamborghini hoverboard. It has a pair of 8.5-inch pneumatic tires which are designed to go over even sand, gravel, and dirt – you name it. All the while, you will still enjoy a smooth ride. Then there is the 400-watt dual motor which can push to a max speed of 10 mph and climb up a 20-degree incline. So that means you can take the hoverboard on a hike in the mountains, and you won’t have any issues. However, you should be careful not to get stranded as the range is only 10 miles.


Luckily you can keep track of the battery life via the mobile app, which is also a great way to track your speed and distance or to simply power off the hoverboard. You can also use the app to play your favorite hiking music via Bluetooth speaker. Be warned though that this will drain the battery even faster, and the charging time is around 2.5 hours. As for the music? Well, if you have read my other reviews, you know what I like, but if you haven’t, then I recommend starting with 
the best self-balancing scooter
 one.


If you are new to the ancient art of hoverboarding and don’t feel comfortable enough to go hiking, don’t worry. The Halo X has a feature that makes it one of the coolest hoverboards in my opinion. There are three modes, including beginner, normal, and advanced modes, each with their own level of difficulty. All in all, it is pretty self explanatory. Let’s see, what else, what else? The hoverboard is also UL-certified, and it has fireproof batteries for the extra protection.

Fastest Hoverboard Buyer’s Guide


Have you ever wondered how fast a hoverboard can go or what the fastest hoverboard is? If you have, this is the right place for you. The answer may be more complicated than you first realized. That is because there are many factors that go into the max speed of a self balancing scooters, some of which might surprise you while others you definitely would have guessed. 


Speed


Let’s start with definitely the most important factor when choosing the fastest hoverboard – speed. You should know that the average hoverboard has a max speed of 6–8 mph, but those are rookie numbers, and you and I need to pump those numbers up. How can we do that you ask? Well, a lot of factors go into how fast a hoverboard is, such as the wheel size, motor power, what terrain you are riding on, and last, but definitely not least, the rider’s weight.


I touched briefly on this in the intro, but don’t go at max speed if this is your first hoverboard. You don’t want to end up like Wile E. Coyote when you are trying to be the Road Runner. Luckily, some self-balancing scooters – such as the Halo Rover X – come with different modes for different levels of experience. These learning modes can decrease the electric scooter’s max speed and increase its responsiveness. If you are a new rider, the experience will be really helpful to you. The learning modes will help you practice while making sure you don’t go flying off at max speed – and I mean that literally. 


Now, once you have mastered the art of the hoverboard, you can start using 100% of its power. Be warned though that you won’t be able to achieve max speed all the time. Think of it like a secret technique that needs to meet certain conditions before activating. Depending on where you live, those conditions are actually quite easy to achieve. You see, in order to achieve max speed, you need to ride the hoverboard on a flat and smoothly paved road. No hills, no nothing as the incline will definitely slow you down. The same goes for grass or gravel or if you are in European cobblestone. It takes more power to get across those types of road, and yes that’s true even for all terrain hoverboards.


So if you live somewhere that has a lot of hills or cobblestone roads, you will have a harder time achieving the max speed. “But…” I can already hear you saying “…won’t going down a hill make me faster?” Yes, yes it will; however, I do not recommend it. While cruising down a hill is generally fun and reasonably safe on bicycles and even on a proper electric scooter, it is extremely dangerous on a hoverboard, and I do not recommend it, even if you are wearing your safety gear. After all, in the end, speed is important, but there is nothing more valuable than your life. 


Weight Capacity


Let’s talk about something that will also affect your speed. The weight capacity. It goes without saying, but you should never exceed the maximum weight limit. In fact, you should never go near it either. For example, if you have a hoverboard with a maximum weight capacity of 220 lbs and you weigh 200 lbs, this may put additional strain on the self-balancing scooter. Don’t worry, nothing will happen. It won’t break or anything like that, but it might not be able to achieve its maximum potential. So you should look for a hoverboard that has a significantly higher weight capacity, even if the speed is a bit lower.


Now generally, the maximum weight limit is around the 200 lbs range, but some go lower, and some can go up to more than 300 lbs. However, those are a rarity and significantly more expensive than say the TOMOLOO hoverboard.


Battery Life & Distance Per Charge


Last but not least, we have the battery life. This may not seem like it has an important influence on the speed, but in essence, the hoverboard is an electric vehicle so that means the battery plays a part in every aspect of the hoverboards as a whole. The speed of your self-balancing scooter will be greatly influenced by the size and power of the battery. Most of the time, hoverboards use a lithium-ion battery which is pretty unstable, so a lot of safety measures have been installed to make sure you don’t explode. I don’t have time to get into it now, but if you are curious, you can see my article on 
the best hoverboard brand
 where I go more in-depth.


Now, the battery will not only determine how fast your hoverboard can go but also its maximum range. With the average being around 7–10 miles on a single charge. If you are someone who doesn’t like waiting around, you should also look for a self-balancing scooter with a shorter charging time. Most are around the 1–3-hour mark, but I have never seen one below the 1-hour mark. A general rule of thumb I like to follow is that if a hoverboard has a longer charging time than range, the battery is not worth it, and maybe you should look into something else. This can also be applied to any electric vehicle really, with the exception of cars.


A good battery will have around an 8–10-mile range with a 1-hour charging time. Of course, there are some that can do way better than that, and there are definitely some hoverboards that do way worse. In the end, if you want a hoverboard that you can use on your vacation, you should look into a longer range with a shorter charging time.


FAQ


Q: How fast can a hoverboard go?


A: The average is around 6–8 miles, although some can be slower and some much faster.


Q: Which is the fastest hoverboard?


A: The Hoverboard with the fastest speed is Swagtron T6, but the best hoverboard with incredible speed overall is the Halo Rover X.


Q: What about the fastest Segway?


A: The fastest Segway that is not a hoverboard is the Segway Apex, while the fastest Segway hoverboard is the Segway MiniPro.


Q: How fast does a Razor hoverboard go?


A: Most Razor hoverboards fall in the average range of 6–8 miles.


Q: How can you make a hoverboard faster?


A: Although there are ways to make a hoverboard go faster, I cannot recommend it as it can ruin both your electric scooter and warranty.

The 10 Best Electric Scooters That You NEED to Get Your Hands On,https://10beasts.com/best-electric-scooter/,"



Sure, you can cycle to work every day if you’re keen on saving up on petrol costs and want to do your part for the environment, but what if there was a way to do both with added convenience and ease? 


Luckily, there 
is
 a way – with electric scooters, of course!


Electric scooters come in all kinds of ranges, top speeds, and price categories. For example, you can find special models specifically built for kids and others created to support off-road riding.


I use an electric scooter five days a week to get to work. On the weekends, it comes in handy when I’m looking for an economical way to drive myself to the local community park that’s 5 miles away. 


The best part? It costs me under a dollar for my daily commute (remember, electricity is cheaper than petrol!). How great is that?


If you’re looking for an electric scooter, too, you’re in the right place. To help you make the right choice, I have compiled a list of the best electric scooters I know of, including superstars like the Segway-Ninebot KickScooter MAX, Unagi’s Model One, and the trusty Glion Dolly. 


Each product in this list is best suited to a specific purpose (e.g., if you need a waterproof product that can handle the rain, you can choose the Model One). I have mentioned these in the form of accolades to make things easy for you.


In the end, you’ll find a handy buyer’s guide to walk you through the key fundamentals of electric scooters (and some secret tips manufacturers won’t tell you) to amp up the ease of your product selection process. 


So, are you ready to discover the best electric scooters out there?


Let’s dive in!

OUR TOP PICK


My top pick for the best electric scooter is the 
Segway-Ninebot KickScooter MAX
. If you’re in a rush and only have time to read over the review for just one scooter, I’d advise you to look into this one. The Ninebot MAX offers an impressive range of 40 miles per charge thanks to its single 350W motor. It also has a remarkable top speed of 18.6 mph, which is more than enough if you plan on sticking to intra city movement. Its pneumatic tires improve the drive’s smoothness and give it an excellent grip over the ground, so you don’t need to worry about finding your balance – just let the Ninebot MAX do its thing!

Best Electric Scooters Full Reviews


If you’ve ever gone e-scooter shopping, you’ll know that the market is overflowing with all kinds of electric scooters. However, most of these aren’t worth considering and have some major design flaws. You can easily end up with the wrong scooter if you’re not careful and will have to go back and search for a better product.


To save you the hassle of learning from trial and error, I have handpicked my favorite e-scooters and listed them here. Each product title is followed by an in-depth review going over the pros and cons of the e-scooter so that you can make an informed decision before you pay up.

Segway’s Ninebot KickScooter MAX is by far one of the most comfortable e-scooters I have ever driven. This is in part because of its large, 10-inch wheels that allow a perfect balance when riding. If balance is important to you, find out more about the 
best self-balancing scooters
 on the market.


This e-scooter’s comfort levels are further improved by its front- and rear-wheel shock absorbers. These work alongside the self-healing wheels to reduce the effect of speed bumps and uneven terrains, ultimately allowing you to have a smooth and comfortable journey. 


The Ninebot KickScooter’s 350-watt motor allows it to cover 40 miles without needing to stop for a recharge. This is a pretty healthy range, especially if you’re planning on using it regularly for your daily commute. 


This is 100 watts greater than the Xiaomi M365, off of which the Segway-Ninebot MAX is based. However, despite this 40% increase in driving power, the Ninebot MAX demands that you kick-start it all the way through its first 2 or so miles. If you haven’t guessed by now, this e-scooter doesn’t employ a zero-start mode. 


I found it slightly challenging to kick-start this device when moving upward on a slope. Thanks to gravity testing my every movement, I had to employ a higher kick speed than is usually required to get the e-scooter started and the motor fully engaged. 


Luckily though, you don’t need to worry about this when moving on level ground or down a slope. So, if your regular routes don’t include upward slopes at the start of your journey, you don’t need to worry too much about this feature.


This device also takes a while to charge (6 hours), but this shouldn’t be a problem because you get to ride it for 40 miles nonstop on a full battery. 


Another potential downside to this device is its weight. The Segway-Ninebot MAX weighs 41.2 pounds, so if you’re planning on folding it up and carrying it across your back… don’t. 


However, suppose you’re not too concerned about portability. In that case, I’d say that this is an excellent scooter for everyday commute thanks to its commendable range, powerful motor, smooth drive, and impressive comfort levels.


 
 
Pros
 




 Remarkably comfortable riding experience


 Suitable top speed; enough for intra city movement


 Large range


 Anti-shock front- and rear-wheel system


 Tubeless pneumatic tires offer a smooth drive


 Affordable, especially considering speed and range specs




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Heavy; difficult to carry


 No zero-start system


 No suspension

If you’re looking for an affordable e-scooter for adults and kids to use casually, I’d recommend you consider the SWAGTRON Swagger 5 Elite. The best thing about this scooter is its massive max rider weight capacity, but more on that later.


The Swagger 5 Elite charges remarkably fast, so you don’t need to worry about having to leave it overnight at the charging dock. You can easily leave it to charge for a little over 3 hours before it’s ready to drive you to the grocery store and back. In fact, as an added bonus, this e-scooter has enough juice to let you make a few stops on the way, too. How about stopping at the park for a quick jog? 


On the downside, this device might not be able to take you much farther than that; there’s only so much you can do with a maximum range of 11 miles. 


Still, if you’re looking for an economy electric scooter adults can use, add this one to your shortlist because what it lacks in range, it makes up for in other places.


Did you know that the Swagger 5 Elite can support riders weighing up to 320 lbs? That’s more than what most electric scooters adults use are capable of offering. Of course, this scooter isn’t only for those who fall into the heavier weight range. Anyone who needs a scooter to drive them around the neighborhood can benefit from all that the SWAGTRON Swagger 5 Elite has to offer. 


Apart from being the best electric scooter for heavy adults, this device has its own smartphone app (for both Android and iOS). You can use this app to track important ride stats, including your total mileage and remaining battery power. 


Additionally, this scooter can carry you at a top speed of 18 miles per hour. This is enough for the everyday commute. In fact, it is 3 miles greater than the legally allowed top speed in most neighborhoods. 


However, this top speed isn’t enough for extreme activities. I’ve got to admit though that the Swagger 5 Elite wasn’t designed for off-road trips or extreme sports in the first place. Instead, it was created for casual commute, at which it does an excellent job by providing a moderate travel range, a convenient charging time, a healthy top speed, 
and
 the ability to support up to 320 lbs of weight in both rider weight and groceries  – or anything you may be carrying with you at the time.


In my eyes, the SWAGTRON Swagger 5 Elite is a clear winner. 


 
 
Pros
 




 Can support up to 320 lbs rider weight


 Supported by a smartphone app


 Decent top speed for a casual commute


 Lightweight


 Short charge time




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Modest range (11 miles)


 Doesn’t fold in enough

The Razor E100 is hands down one of the most popular kids’ electric scooters out there. No doubt, it is an excellent product and is fully fit to be your child’s very first Razor scooter. 


In fact, you can think of the Razor E100 as training wheels of sorts. Thanks to its 100-watt, high-torque, chain-driven motor, this scooter can go up to 10 mph for 6.5 miles, nonstop for 40 minutes. While this may not be a large enough range for most adults, I’d say it’s ideal for little children. If you’re buying for a child, it’s worth checking out the 
best hoverboard for kids
 too.


This product isn’t too heavy either, so it’ll be easy for your child to maneuver and move around as needed. However, picking it up might be a little challenging, even for adults. You’re most likely going to have to store this product on your garage floor as it might prove too heavy to easily lift up and hang on the wall for storage, as some people like to do.  


Another thing I liked about the Razor E100 is its tire style. This product employs 8-inch-wide air-filled tires that contain a healthy balance of both bounciness and stability to absorb shocks where needed and allow for a light, floaty feeling while driving. 


These tires also help smoothen out the drive, so you don’t need to worry about your child losing their balance and tumbling over because of a small bump in the road. 


What you 
do
 need to take into consideration, though, is the battery system. I’ve heard plenty of parents complain that this device’s battery died out on them after a few months of use. However, I also discovered that this will only happen if your child forgets to power off their scooter and instead leaves it on overnight or for multiple hours on end. 


Still, chain-driven motors can be a little tricky. Thus, be sure you keep tabs on how well your child is taking care of their scooter, and remind them to power it off as soon as they’re done using it. 


 
 
Pros
 




 Safe and suitable tires for children


 Attractive design


 Ideal size for kids




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Cannot be folded


 Difficult to store


 Limited range

If you’re wondering whether or not this product is worth considering, I’ll say one thing: this is an 
Unagi
 scooter. That means you’re promised a sturdy and well-built product with overall commendable specs.


If you’re new to the world of Unagi, don’t worry! I’d be more than happy to walk you through it. 


Unagi’s Model One has plenty to offer in every sphere. This brilliant electric scooter comes in four fantastic colors, so you can choose whichever one fits best with your style (their Scarlet Fire is a personal favorite!). 


Before you begin choosing from Cosmic Blue, Scarlet Fire, Sea Salt White, and Matte Black, let’s take a look at this product’s performance.


The Model One is available in two motor types: the E500 dual motor and the E250 single motor. If you’re an avid electric scooter user, it might be worth looking into the dual-motor option. However, after trying out both options, I felt like the single motor option works fine in most cases.


I’d recommend the 500-watt dual motor scooter to those who regularly encounter uphill slopes up to 15 degrees high. However, if you generally ride on flatter terrains (up to 6-degree lifts), go for the 250-watt single-motor option. 


It also charges fast and not too heavy, making it easy for users to carry around with them as needed. The Model One’s single-click fold system allows it to collapse into a portable version within mere seconds. All you need to do is push the button, and you’re good to go. 


On the downside, this scooter is expensive… 
really
 expensive. Still, as an Unagi product, you can bet on it lasting you a lifetime.  


This device doesn’t do too well with bumps either. However, thanks to its sleek design, the Unagi Model One has no trouble getting you through large crowds in an instant. It is also IP54 standard waterproof and contains a nonslip rubber deck, making it excellent for people who live in cities prone to regular rainfall.  


 
 
Pros
 




 Sleek design


 Good for elevated terrains and slopes (E500 model)


 Fast charging


 Single-click fold system


 Good top speed




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Expensive


 Average performance over bumps and rough terrains

The Glion Dolly is my top pick for regular commuters, and here’s why. 


Firstly, the Glion Dolly is built with a sturdy aluminum frame, so you don’t have to worry about it picking up damage when riding through the city’s bustling streets. So, if you live in a particularly busy metropolis or a neglected neighborhood (bumpy sidewalks, I’m looking at you), then this is possibly the best electric scooter you could choose. 


Secondly, its sophisticated, streamlined design adds to its brilliant performance in crowded areas. The Glion Dolly is designed to make it easy for users to fold it up and carry it onto public commuter trains. The sleek design also comes in handy when you’re trying to make your way through a crowd, which is why I strongly believe that this is the ideal electric scooter for daily commute. 


Additionally, the Dolly is lightweight and hence offers excellent portability. It also has a special handle and Dolly wheels which help you move it around when folded and can stand by itself so that you can go hands-free. 


With a top speed of 15 miles per hour, the Dolly can get you anywhere without breaking the locality’s speed limits. Most municipalities don’t allow e-scooters to go over 15 mph anyway, so having a default top speed of 15 mph is ideal. 


On the downside, this device’s braking mechanism isn’t as smooth as some of the other e-scooters I’ve tried (e.g., like the Unagi Model One). However, this shouldn’t be much of a problem because you’ll be under 15 mph most of the time anyway and will seldom feel the need for sudden brakes. 


It may slow down when riding upon an upward slope. The maximum uphill speed I could reach (at a 10% grade) was 7.5 mph. So, keep this in mind if your regular route involves uphill slopes.


 
 
Pros
 




 Easy to fold


 Contains a carry handle


 Honeycomb interior wheels for a smoother drive


 Fast charging




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Slows down on uphill slopes


 Average brake performance; could be smoother

Developed and designed in Great Britain, the Pure Air e-scooter is definitely one of the best budget buys out there. This product offers superior quality at an affordable price, along with a wide range of useful features.


The Pure Air is IP65-rated, which means that it can withstand harsh rain (and even survive after being dunked into a pool, for that matter.) This product was designed for the UK with rainy London in mind, so it’s not surprising to find that it is fully waterproof.


Rainy days bring around muddy puddles. Luckily, this Pure Air scooter has built-in mudguards to stop it from getting dirty when you ride through such puddles. 


This device is supported by a digital app (Android and iOS) that you can use to keep tabs on essential stats like miles covered and current battery power. The scooter itself has a brilliant multifunctional LED display that supports easy viewing even on a sunny day. 


The Pure Air flaunts dual LED lights, both at the front and rear sides. You’ll also find handy reflectors along its body and a small bell at the front. 


While this product is foldable, keep in mind that you cannot shorten its stem. The handlebars do not fold in either. However, this shouldn’t be much of a problem considering how the overall device does fold into a more compact model, making it easy to carry around when not in use. 


Another thing that didn’t sit right with me was how long this scooter took to come to a halt from top speed. When zooming by at 15.5 mph on a flat, even surface, the Pure Air took 15 whole seconds to reach 0 mph, which is a bit too long in my opinion, especially when compared to other scooters within this price range. 


On the plus side, you’ll find that the Pure Air contains fluid-filled, pneumatic tires. This technology helps the scooter maintain its balance when riding over gravel and other rough surfaces and creates an overall smoother riding experience by absorbing shocks caused by cracks and bumps in the road.  


 
 
Pros
 




 Fluid-filled pneumatic tires


 Smooth drive


 Affordable and with great features


 Fully waterproof


 App support




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Slow braking speed


 No folding handles

You may have heard of Xiaomi’s popular smartphone range, but did you know that they make electric scooters, too?


The Xiaomi Mi electric scooter has a tested top speed of 15.5 mph, which means it’s fast enough to zip you around town while comfortably staying within the legal speed limits. However, most of the scooters on this list can do that, so why is the Xiaomi Mi special? 


Here’s why:


Firstly, this is one of the few waterproof scooters currently available in the market, so it’s perfect for a rainy day. Thanks to its IP54 water resistance level, you can comfortably drive this scooter through puddles without having to worry about damage or electric shocks.


It also has slightly larger wheels (11 inches). This increased wheel size affords the Xiaomi Mi electric scooter greater balance, especially when driving over uneven roads that have become worn out after constant rainfall.


On the downside, this scooter may slow down when you’re going uphill (10% grade or more). So, if your everyday route is filled with uphill slopes, consider another product, like the Unagi Model One, which is built especially for ramps and slopes.


Of course, the Xiaomi Mi will ride up slopes (it won’t just stop altogether), but expect its average top speed to fall to between 5 and 7 mph if you weigh as much as the average adult does. 


This product has both a rear disc brake and front regenerative brakes, so you don’t need to fret about having trouble slowing down from high speeds – just trust the Xiaomi Mi to handle it. 


However, this e-scooter lacks a suspension system. Still, it offers a comfortable ride at an affordable price point.


 
 
Pros
 




 Pneumatic tires for a comfortable ride

Craving some fun? Hop onto the Apollo Explore e-scooter!


The Apollo Explore was built for speed. Within seconds of starting up this scooter, I found myself cruising at 31 mph, as promised by the manufacturer-provided specs. It doesn’t end there, though. The Apollo Explore has 
plenty
 more to offer.


This beast of a scooter sports a 21-inch-wide and 9-inch-long deck that’s perfect for everyone. You can also adjust the steering column’s height, which I found particularly helpful as someone who isn’t as blessed in the height department as others. 


You don’t find an adjustable column height option on most electric scooters. So, if you’ve always wanted a product that changes in accordance with your build, the Apollo Explore is definitely worth considering.


In terms of power, you won’t find many e-scooters that top this one. The Explore has a 1000W motor that offers a 1400W peak with rear-wheel drive. This comes in handy when you’re going uphill. Even though the Explore’s average top speed will fall by 50 percent on upward slopes, it’s still significantly higher than the regular top speed most electric scooters will offer you.


Additionally, this scooter’s tires are not only 10 inches across but also 2.75 inches wide. Having tires thicker than average means added stability and balance for the Apollo Explore, allowing you to speed up without worrying about accidentally toppling over.


On the downside, all these brilliant features make the Apollo Explore much heavier than the average scooter. This device weighs 52 lbs, making it challenging to carry around. 


It is also quite expensive, so you may want to skip over the Apollo Explore if you’re on a budget. In my honest opinion, it’s still worth every cent, regardless. 


 
 
Pros
 




 High top speed (31 mph)


 Fantastic range


 Large tires


 Regenerative braking (foolproof and fast)




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Heavy


 Expensive

The Kaabo Wolf Warrior stands true to its name. This e-scooter is a big, beautiful beast that can fight against virtually any terrain, no matter how rugged, and get you through it with no trouble at all. 


You’re bound to encounter many uneven surfaces when driving off-road. Luckily, you don’t need to worry about these anymore because the Wolf Warrior contains motorbike-grade inverted hydraulic front shock absorbers to minimize the effect of bumps and cracks in the road. Other than this scooter, you can look for 
great off-road hoverboards
 as well.


It also has a complete hydraulic braking system that works alongside the ABS system (optionally enabled) to enhance your braking experience. You’ll be able to stop within a few seconds of triggering the breaks, no matter how fast you’re going.


Unfortunately, this scooter is extremely heavy at 110 lbs. I had a significant amount of trouble taking it up the stairs and had to ask a friend for help. However, almost every off-road e-scooter weighs over 100 lbs. I’m afraid this is one of those things you’ll just have to make your peace with.


On the brighter side of things, you’ll find this scooter’s 70-mile range to be extremely useful, especially when you’re on an off-road trip. Remote areas generally don’t offer electrical charging ports, which is why a larger range is always appreciable in such cases. 


This impressive range is possible thanks to the Wolf Warrior’s powerful 2400W motor. Pair this large range with a top speed of 50 mph, and there’s no stopping you from going anywhere you please in a fraction of the time!


This scooter is built for speed. It contains a tough exterior made from tubular steel. It can support up to 330 lbs of weight without compromising on speed or overall performance. 


You’ll also find two brilliant LED lights at the scooter’s front. These help light the way when you’re riding past nightfall, making this the perfect electric scooter for off-road travels!

 Extremely fast


 IPX4 water-resistant

If you’re looking for a budget buy, you can’t go wrong with a Razor electric scooter. This stands true regarding the E300 too. 


Most people buy this scooter because of how affordable it is. I’d recommend this product to anyone on a steep student budget who still wants to own an electric scooter for regular commute.


Want to cruise in style? If so, I have some good news for you! The Razor E300’s alloy steel body also comes in four different colors (white, red, matte gray, and blue), so feel free to choose whichever one matches your aesthetic. However, I’d recommend matte gray if you want a color that’s both stylish and low maintenance. Lighter colors require extra care because they get dirty easily, so keep that in mind when deciding a shade.


This product’s pneumatic air-filled tires serve as shock absorbers and allow for a smooth riding experience even when you’re passing over unkempt roads and sidewalks. 


On the downside, the Razor E300’s batteries can only keep you going for 40 minutes in one go. While this may not be enough for long-distance travel, it works just fine for university students trying to get around campus without tiring themselves out. 


I really like how this product offers a top speed of 15 mph despite its low cost. Fifteen miles per hour means that the Razor E300 will help you zoom around the neighborhoods just as fast as most of the other options on this list but at a significantly lower price point. 


You should be wary of its weight though. The Razor E300 isn’t light enough to carry with you for longer periods, so you’ll need someplace safe to keep it when it isn’t in use. 


All in all, I’d recommend this product to all those who are actively looking for an affordable Razor scooter to transport them across short distances at a fast pace. 


 
 
Pros
 




 Affordable


 Dual-suspension system


 Strong build


 Massive deck




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Requires overnight charge (for full battery)


 Heavy




 
 
 


Best Electric Scooter Buyer’s Guide


Before buying one, ask yourself, “What is the best electric scooter for me?”


Asking this question will help you clarify your priorities and understand exactly what you want in a scooter. Once you know what you’re looking for, the scooter-hunting process will become remarkably easy.


If you’re still unsure about which scooter to buy or would like to understand how electric scooters are ranked, I suggest you go over the guide below.


Price


Before looking into electric scooters, I’d recommend choosing a fixed-price range within which you’re willing to work. E-scooters can cost you up to $3000 or more depending on the type of model, so it helps to have an idea of how much you’re okay with spending.


If you’re a student or aren’t keen on spending all your savings on an e-scooter, why not look into the Razor E300? 


On the other hand, if you’re looking for a new-age scooter complete with an expensive price tag (and excellent additional features!), consider the Unagi Model One and Glion Dolly. 


Range


Electric scooters have one primary purpose: to get you from point A to point B (all while offering an exciting driving experience, too, of course!)


However, before you can set out on your journey, be sure to check your scooter’s range to see if it can support you.  


An electric scooter’s range indicates how far it can go on a full charge before running out of power. 


Although most scooter manufacturers do mark their product with a fixed-range value, know that this number can change depending upon external factors, including rider weight, wind speed and weather, driving mode, and average speed. 


Here’s a fun fact for you: 
According to a 
survey
 conducted in 2018, electric scooter manufacturers may advertise a range that’s 30% higher than the true value
. 


Therefore, before buying an electric scooter, I’d advise you to subtract 30 percent from the range mentioned by the manufacturer. This will give you an idea of how far the scooter will 
really
 go and thus help you make an informed decision when choosing a product. 


From the scooters mentioned above, the Segway-Ninebot KickScooter MAX (40 miles) and Kaabo Wolf Warrior (70 miles) have the greatest ranges.  


Due to its impressive range, the Wolf Warrior is ideal for off-road travel. However, it costs a lot more than most people are willing to spend on an e-scooter for regular use. 


If you’re looking for an economical e-scooter for your everyday commute but one that affords an excellent range, I’d suggest you go for the Segway-Ninebot KickScooter MAX. 


Battery and Charge Time


If you’re not fluent in how volts and amperes work, don’t worry. When buying an e-scooter, it’s enough to just look at the range (and reduce it by 30 percent, of course) to understand how far you can go before the battery runs out of juice. 


Don’t forget to look at the vehicle’s charge time, too, which will give you an idea of how long the battery pack will take to fully reenergize itself from zero point.


If you plan on regularly commuting large distances, you might need to charge your electric scooter in between rides. For example, you might use the e-scooter to go to work 15 miles away and then use it again to return home when the workday is over. 


If so, you’ll have to make sure that your device gets enough time to charge while you’re at work (refer to its charge time), or else you won’t be able to make the trip home! 


Take real-life instances like this into account when purchasing a scooter. In other words, don’t accidentally buy a device with a 12-hour charge time when you only get 8 hours to charge it at work!


Top Speed


If your scooter can go as fast as 24 km per hour (speed mph – 15), you’re good to go. 


This is because most public areas and neighborhoods don’t allow electric scooters to go beyond this max speed, anyway. So, having anything over 24 km per hour, or 15 miles per hour, is a bonus. 


Alternately, if you’re buying an electric scooter for extreme sports, feel free to invest in a faster scooter. For this, I’d recommend investing in a product that has a top speed of around 80 km per hour (50 mph) or higher, like the Wolf Warrior. 


Weight


Weight mainly comes into play when you’re considering portability. So, if you’re not someone who’s going to fold your scooter and carry it around, the vehicle’s weight shouldn’t concern you too much. 


However, if you 
do
 plan to carry your folded scooter around (or rolling it in its compact form), it’s best to opt for a lightweight model over a heavier one. 


An electric scooter’s weight alone does not define its performance. Instead, your scooter’s drive is primarily influenced by its motor and not its weight, which is why lightweight scooters may perform just as well as their heavier counterparts.


While there is no fixed optimum weight range for easy portability, it may help if you compare the weight of the scooter that you have your eye on with other electrical appliances (like a heavy vacuum cleaner). For example, if your vacuum cleaner weighs 11 lbs, try dragging it around to see how comfortable it is in terms of portability.


You can extrapolate on this feeling, and imagine how comfortable you’d feel moving around a scooter that’s within a similar weight range or even heavier. This will give you an approximate idea of how heavy your scooter should be for it to be easy for you to carry around.


Remember, we are all built differently, so what’s lightweight for me might feel heavy to you or vice versa. Hence, it’s better to find a scooter weight that suits you personally instead of sticking to a recommended weight range. 


Motor


The average scooter will grant you a 250W motor and a top speed of 15 mph. While this is a decent fit for everyday, casual transit, you’ll need more if you’re keen on going off-road or cruising at higher speeds. 


However, motors with higher power ratings cost more. So, if you plan on sticking to short routes and casual travel, I’d suggest you purchase a scooter with an ordinary 250W motor. This will grant you all the power you’ll need for everyday activities and prevent you from burning a large hole inside your pocket, too!


Final Thoughts


I know I just threw a lot of information your way, but don’t panic! Choosing the best electric scooter is really a simple task – I’ve already narrowed it down to ten for you. 


Now, you just need to look at what your needs are. Do you want a scooter that you can just use occasionally? Do you want one for daily commutes? Will you have to carry it around? Once you answer these questions, picking one from this list shouldn’t be a problem!

The Best Electric Unicycle for Any Tech Geek,https://10beasts.com/electric-unicycle/,"

Ah, an electric unicycle, similar to the 
self-balancing scooter 
and yet different. The two devices have a lot in common, for example, they are both electric alternative transportation methods that have gained momentum in the modern day. However, while hoverboards have not been around for a long time, the unicycle has.




It is actually not entirely known when or where the first unicycle was built. However, it is generally accepted that way back 1866, a guy called James Stanley invented a very unique type of bicycle which was thought to be the inspiration for the unicycle.


Throughout the centuries, the unicycle has been used in movies, theater, and as a staple in the circus, which gave it a reputation as a one-wheeled vehicle that was only used for performance purposes and not as an alternative method of transportation. All that began to change in the 1980s when some guys who were into extreme sports saw the unicycle and liked the design, so much so that they modified it for off-roading.


Since then, the unicycle has evolved into the electric unicycle. With unique features and high motor, it gained a new reputation for urban or off-road exploring. Although not as popular as the hoverboard, the unicycle has a long history that goes back centuries.

The Best Electric Unicycle Full Reviews


The electric unicycle has changed so much through the centuries – from a single-wheeled bicycle to an accessory of performance and now to a modern alternative method of transportation. It’s no wonder that brands like Gotway and InMotion are getting more and more mainstream attention. Their products are top of the line. 


Still not sure what to get? Maybe one of our other articles will have the hoverboard, unicycle, or scooter of your dreams!

Let’s begin our product review with the Gotway MTen3 which is the best unicycle for beginners. This electric unicycle looks, well how shall I say this, like a character from WALL-E. It has a slim frame with a round light in the middle, resembling an eye. When the electric unicycle is powered off, it almost looks like it’s sleeping, but when you power it on, the unfolded pedals resemble little arms. 


This Gotway unicycle is perfect for beginners, be they kids or adults. It offers you three variations in battery power: one with a capacity of 325Wh, one with 420Wh, and the largest one with 512Wh. The bigger the capacity, the longer the range your Gotway electric unicycle will have, as well as a higher price tag. The largest 512Wh battery will give you a maximum range of 30 miles, while the smaller ones are around 25–20 miles on a single charge. One thing, however, that will not change with the battery is the speed.


Thanks to its 800W motor, the unicycle will cruise at a max speed of 23+ miles per hour, no matter the battery capacity or range. It also has a 10-inch wheel, thanks to which you will enjoy a smooth ride – that is if you don’t go off-road. Sadly, this particular Gotway unicycle is not built for rougher terrain, so be careful when cruising down the street.


If you are a daredevil and like to ride your unicycle at night, not to worry – among the battery indicator and charging port, there is a LED light that is bright enough to illuminate the road ahead. 


The biggest selling point of this electric vehicle has to be its lightweight and compact size. In fact, it is so small that it will fit in your backpack, possibly with room to spare at just 22 lbs, you can carry it anywhere you go. However, I have some bad news. It looks like the Gotway unicycle is so small that there is no room for a Bluetooth speaker. Not only that, but the placement of the cutoff button is a bit awkward. 


However, in my humble opinion, even with all those negatives, this is quite possibly one of the best unicycles for your daily commute, especially if you are a beginner.


 
 
Pros
 




 Great for beginners


 Lightweight and compact


 Perfect gift for kids and adults




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 No Bluetooth speaker


 Awkward cutoff button

If you are an experienced rider, maybe someone searching for a more adventurous ride, consider the King Song 18XL. This electric vehicle is bulky, although it will also take you where you need to go, even if that is on top of a mountain.


The King Song electric unicycle is an off-road beauty. It offers you two variations in battery power: one with a capacity of 1036Wh and one which is slightly larger than that at 1554Wh. The smaller battery capacity will give you a range of around 40 miles, while the larger almost doubles that at around 70 miles. Of course, as it often is, if you choose the higher battery power, the price will increase significantly.


However, no matter which battery capacity you choose, the 2000W motor will remain the same and so will the maximum speed of 30 miles per hour. Not only that, but the motor is quieter than most and comes equipped with extra torque. As the name might suggest, the King Song 18 unicycle has a massive 18-inch wheel, thanks to which you will enjoy a smooth ride no matter where you go, even if you are on a hike or storming the sandy beaches of Normandy.


The electric vehicle also has a rear and a front LED light which will help if you decide to cruise around at night. Sadly, if you want to listen to music while you are contemplating your existence on an empty road, you are better off with your phone. There is a Bluetooth speaker, but it’s not the best. In fact, I would go as far as to say it is terrible. 


Another thing that slightly disappointed me about this particular King Song electric unicycle is the fact that if you want to unlock the full 2000W motor power, you will need to ride the vehicle for 125 miles exactly; otherwise, the maximum speed is locked at 25 miles per hour. This may not seem like such a big difference, but it’s still annoying. 


Even so, I would still consider giving the King Song electric unicycle a go. It is a wonderful ride, and it even has a retractable handle as well as a mudguard.


 
 
Pros
 




 Amazing battery capacity


 Great range


 Perfect for off-road




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Terrible Bluetooth speaker

We talked about beginners, and we talked about experienced riders. How about the people who are not yet good enough to be considered experienced but are better than beginners? Yeah, you know who you are – this one’s for you gents. The InMotion V8F has a slick modern design, with atmospheric LED lighting.


The InMotion unicycle V8 does not only have a great design but also build quality to match. Riding this thing is as smooth as silk – admittedly not the best comparison. It starts and it stops so easily that you won’t be able to go back to any other unicycle after this one. Not only that, but it is also extremely durable: drop it, crash it, or kick it as many times as you like. Come on, I dare you – you won’t even leave a mark. 


What’s more, this InMotion unicycle has a battery capacity of 518Wh, and sadly, that is your only option, but it could have been worse. At least the battery power is decent. With a range of 22 miles and a maximum speed of 21.7mph, the InMotion wheel will take you anywhere you need to go, as long as you remain on the road. 


The 16-inch wheel is actually one of the best I have ever seen. It contributes greatly to the stability and control of the unicycle. Thanks to the specially made tire, you are able to enjoy a very, very smooth ride.


There are also three circles of LED lights on both sides. You can adjust the colors via the app for a more personal touch to your electric unicycle. There is also a 2W LED beam that can light up the road ahead for a safer nighttime journey. Sadly, there is no Bluetooth speaker, but there is a retractable handle that is protected by microfiber leather.


Now, I love this unicycle. It is durable, and it has a clean design, but its speed is a bit on the slower side, and the range is not as long as I would have liked it to be. It also doesn’t help that there is only one battery option. Even so, I think it is an amazing vehicle that deserves more attention. 


 
 
Pros
 




 Durable


 Great design


 Very stable




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Slow speed


 Short range

Now, while the InMotion V8F has a short range and a good design, the Gotway Nikola 2000W is the opposite. It has the longest range I have seen in a unicycle, as well as a pretty amazing top speed. However, its design is a little bulky, and it feels like it’s not as durable as the V8F.


This Gotway electric unicycle offers you two variations in battery power: one with a capacity of 1600Wh and one with a battery capacity of 2100 Wh. Of course, with higher capacity comes a longer range, with the max being around 100 miles per charge. Not only that, but the maximum speed can go up to 40 miles per hour, although that is not recommended. The recommended maximum speed is around 35 mph. 


The wheel is 16 inches and more than capable of taking you off-road. It handles bump surprisingly well, and even the roughest terrain will feel like a smooth ride – not to mention that while you are off-roading, you can listen to your favorite music via the Bluetooth speaker, which produces crisp audio.


There is also an LED ring light that goes around the wheel as well as a bright headlight, thanks to which you are able to ride at night with no worries. There is also a retractable handle, but it is not recommended that you use it to lift the wheel. That is because the Gotway electric unicycle is a bit on the heavier side and the handle is a bit fragile, so lifting it might cause unnecessary stress on the connecting joint. 


Other than that, you have nothing to worry about. The electric vehicle rides smoothly across any terrain. In fact, I took this camping with me – this time alone – and I had so much fun riding it around in the woods while listening to some chill lo-fi vibes. What? I don’t always listen to Sabaton.

Let’s talk about the best alternative to the Gotway Nikola – that is the King Song 16X. These two, despite looking completely different, have very similar specs, so much so that you could confuse them for one another. In my own personal canon, I like to imagine that they are rivals who have a love–hate relationship.


The King Song electric unicycle has a space-like design. Imagine a futuristic Mars rover, which only has one wheel. That’s what the King Song 16X reminds me of. Although still a bit bulky, the design on this one is much better than on the Nikola, at least in my humble opinion.


This King Song electric unicycle has only one variation in battery power, and that is the 1554Wh capacity. It’s not the best I have seen but definitely not the worst either. As for the maximum range – it’s around 65 miles, and in ideal conditions, it can go up to 70. There is also the 2200W motor power that has a maximum speed of 31 miles per hour.


The wheel is 16 inches and more than capable of taking you off-road. It can handle anything from sand to grass and mud. However, it doesn’t handle bumps so well, and it might not be the smoothest ride out there, but it still does a pretty decent job.


There are also two strips of LED lights in the front as well as the main headlight. When you are driving at night and you decide to put on all three LED lights, the road will light up so much that you will feel like it’s daytime. There is also a Bluetooth speaker which is decent enough and gets the job done. 


There is also a retractable handle as well as a side padding to protect it if the unicycle suddenly finds itself on the ground. The King Song 16X and the Gotway Nikola have a lot in common, but they also have a lot of different parts. It’s almost like they have both decided to focus on completely different aspects of a unicycle. There is, however, one thing that Gotway has a definitive advantage in, and that is the price. When compared, the Gotway is slightly cheaper than the King Song electric unicycle.

Gotway MSX Pro

Battery Capacity
: 1800Wh | 
Range
: 60 miles |

Now, let’s move on to the most premium electric unicycle out there. The Gotway MSX Pro has a stylish design and a casing made out of carbon fiber. As you might have guessed, this electric vehicle is not on the affordable side of things. In fact, when compared to some of the other entries, it’s significantly more expensive.


This particular Gotway electric unicycle has a bulky design with a wide 18-inch wheel. It does not offer you any variations in battery capacity, but it has two options when it comes to motor power. There is the first option which is a 2000W motor with a high speed, and the other option is a 2500W motor which offers you extra torque.


As for the battery power, it’s in the 1800Wh range, which is pretty amazing. As for the range proper, it sits at a maximum of 60 miles per charge. Then, there is the top speed which can go as high as 37 miles per hour.


The tire is skid-resistant and can take you anywhere from grass to gravel and back again while you are enjoying a smooth ride. I have to say this is one of my favorite wheels, because not only can it handle bumps and hills really well, but it is an all-around beauty. I would love to take this Gotway product camping with me and maybe the nephew too.


There are 2 LED headlights at the front, which will brighten up any road. So you are safe if you want to take the electric unicycle for a nighttime cruising. As for the Bluetooth speakers, well there are two of them. Both function great and can be used either to play your favorite tunes or act as an alarm if someone decides to take your Gotway away.


This is an all-around great electric scooter, and I would highly recommend it.

Gotway Monster V3

View on ewheels.com






Next up, we have another Gotway product. The Gotway Monster V3 is a gentle giant. It has a massive, and I really mean massive, 22-inch tire. Its design is slim and stylish, while still remaining functional. Out of all the electric unicycles so far, the design on this one has to be my favorite.


This particular Gotway electric unicycle has a single variation in battery power, and that is the 1845 Wh capacity. It also has a range of 74 miles and a top speed of 38 mph. However, the maximum range is only attainable if you constantly ride at 20 miles per hour, which is really disappointing in my opinion. What’s not disappointing is the 2000W motor power as well as the carbon fiber shell. Even if you drop this bad boy on the ground, it will remain whole.


The most impressive part of this Gotway electric unicycle has to be its – and I say again – massive tire. Thanks to this, you will be able to enjoy the smoothest ride of your life, I mean it. This monster – hey I get the name now – can take you through almost anything, and you won’t feel the difference. Riding this on sand, gravel, or rocks is the same as riding it on a smoothly paved road. It handles bumps really well, and it doesn’t even know the meaning of the word “hill.” This is the perfect unicycle to take with you on a camping trip.


On the front, there is a big LED light that functions as your headlight. It will light up any dark road so much so that you will be able to see miles ahead – ok, not really, but it is kinda bright. There is also a Bluetooth speaker that is quite possibly the best I have seen in an electric unicycle so far.


However, it’s not all great. From all of the entries so far, this has to be one of the most expensive electric unicycles. When compared to the other products, this will cost you an arm and a leg, which is not ideal. Personally, I like my arms and legs – but if you are willing, it’s well worth your time and body parts.


 
 
Pros
 




 Amazingly smooth ride

Now, the next electric unicycle was built with veteran riders in mind – I mean, it’s in the name. The Veteran Sherman has a slightly bulky design but still pleasant to ride and look at. It also has the second most massive tire on this list at 20 inches. Not only that, but there is an LED display on top, which you can use to see and set anything from the top speed to the pedal angle.


The Veteran electric unicycle quite possibly has the largest battery capacity currently on the market at 3,200Wh. This beast of a unicycle has a range of 128 miles per single charge, so if you are planning a trip, you know which of these electric vehicles to get. Now, let’s talk about the elephant in the room. At a maximum speed of 45 miles per hour, this is the fastest electric unicycle out there. It has a 2,500W motor power as well as an amazing off-road tire.


The wheel can take you anywhere from sand to grass and gravel, and you will enjoy a smooth ride. It has amazing torque and balance, not to mention that the acceleration is as smooth as warm butter.


Then there is the LED light, which as you might expect is bright enough to light up a dark road. You can also use the display on the top to set up the headlight and adjust its brightness if you are not satisfied with the default. There is also a Bluetooth speaker that has crisp audio and good bass.


There is, however, one quite significant con in this sea of pros. If you thought that the Gotway Monster V3 is a bit on the expensive side, you have seen nothing yet. The Veteran Sherman makes the Gotway Monster look like a cheap electric unicycle, but as I said before, if you are willing, it’s well worth the purchase.

Let’s do something different – let’s look at the best budget electric unicycle. The SwagRoller is really cheap when compared to the other entries, and that, in no way, means it’s bad. The SwagRoller has an interesting design, one which you will either love or hate. It essentially looks like a tall robot, with futuristic-looking features. 


This particular electric unicycle has a 450W motor, which is capable of a maximum speed of 9 miles per hour, which may not seem amazing, but for this price, it’s actually quite decent.  The SwagRoller also has a max range of 12.4 miles per charge, which means if you are riding it around constantly, it will take around 2 hours for the battery power to die. 


As for the wheel, well actually, there are two of them. Both are extremely tough and filled with air. While it may be controversial for a unicycle to have more than one tire, the SwagRoller is still considered exactly that – an electric unicycle. You can also take it anywhere you want since the tires are perfectly well equipped for off-roading. However, I would still pick some of the other options if I want an electric vehicle specifically for going off-road, or I would pick an off-road hoverboard – that will do the job just as well.


There is also a large headlight in the middle, surrounded by two rim LED lights, which glow blue. Thus, you will be perfectly visible during the night. Another quality feature is the Bluetooth speaker – it is not the best, but it gets the job done. 


Other than that, I would definitely recommend this electric unicycle for people on a budget. Although its unique design might put you off for a bit, trust me, you will get used to it. All in all, this is a great device for the price.


 
 
Pros
 




 Affordable


 Great features


 Great battery

Finally, we are here – we have reached the top of the mountain. In my humble opinion, the InMotion V10F is the best electric unicycle out there. It has a futuristic-looking design, and that kind of gives out Tron vibes. Now, after we have gone through all the electric vehicles on this list, I can safely say that the InMotion V10F has my favorite design. 


This particular electric unicycle has a powerful motor, which is capable of a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour, which is pretty decent. The InMotion V10F also has a max range of 30–40 miles per charge, depending on which battery capacity you choose. Speaking of which, the unicycle has two options: one with 680Wh and one with 960Wh capacity. Although both are great and do the job well enough, there is a slight change of price when comparing them, with the higher battery capacity going for a tiny bit more. There is also one more thing I need to mention – the maximum speed cannot be reached if the battery is below 66%, so you can only harness the true potential of this electric vehicle only when at full charge.


As for the wheel, well, it is actually pretty thin. Standing at 16 inches, you can take it anywhere, from a smooth road to the forest or beach. Although it can handle off-roading pretty well, it doesn’t really handle bumps. It’s not uncomfortable per se – just that it could have been a bit better. However, it still gets the job done, and most places you go will be a smooth ride.


There is a bright headlight that will illuminate the path ahead. There are also two LED light strips on both sides of the wheel. The Bluetooth speaker is also pretty decent as it will get the job done. 


I would definitely recommend this one to anybody who is seeking a brand new electric unicycle, be they new to the sport or veterans. 


 
 
Pros
 




 Good range


 Good speed


 Great design


 Perfect gift for anyone




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Top speed is not reachable when below 66% battery power




 
 
 


Best Electric Scooter Buyer’s Guide


Speed


We all want our electric vehicles to be as fast as possible. Even if we don’t need the max speed, it’s always nice to have the option. Likewise, it is important to understand where that speed is coming from. For example, you may have noticed a wide variation in speed between these unicycles and the fastest hoverboards.


When looking at an electric unicycle, you will notice that the manufacturer puts the motor watts on their website, which tells you the top speed before the vehicle overheats. Of course, you can have short-term peaks that are much higher than the given maximum speed. 


Now, although the motor’s watts are a good indicator of how fast your unicycle can go, it is not the only factor. Having the appropriate battery capacity to provide enough current is equally as important, and so is a good control board. In short, a 2200W motor with a small battery pack and a bad control board will not be as good as a 2000W motor with a big battery and a good control board. 


The unicycle, as with any other electric vehicle, has a lot of moving parts and a lot of factors that go into every single spec you see. However, I know some people are not satisfied with that, so they decided to upgrade their product. Sadly, I cannot recommend this, especially if you haven’t done it before. You can destroy your unicycle, and because you tried to modify it, the warranty will be nulled, but I am getting off-topic. 


Battery Pack


Let’s get back on topic with the battery. Probably the most important part of the electric unicycle, the battery is the wheel which makes everything else turn.


Really though, it’s simple here. When it comes to battery capacity, the answer is always this – the bigger the battery, the better. A bigger battery capacity will not only give you more range, but it will also have less voltage sag, meaning you can ride longer without slowing down your speed. Decreasing your speed, otherwise known as speed throttling, is a safety measure that slows down your speed as the battery begins to fade. 


While some models have two or more variants in battery capacity, most only offer one. While it is always nice to have options, my advice is to always choose the higher capacity.


Wheel


There is one simple truth you should know about the tire of a unicycle, and that is – the bigger the wheel diameter, the more comfortable and more stable the electric vehicle is at higher speeds. On the other hand, the opposite also has some advantages. The smaller the diameter, the more agile a unicycle will be. In my opinion, the perfect tire is around 16–20 inches; however, I would also accept the argument that bigger is better. You can also take it like this – a smaller tire usually leads to a more responsive unicycle, while with a large tire, the vehicle will take more effort to get started. 


 Tires can also be swapped out. Many riders swap street tires for a knobby tire to get more grip in off-road trails. So there are benefits to both. However, as mentioned before, I do not recommend tampering with your electric unicycle even if it is just swapping out the tires.


LED Lights


If you want to ride your electric unicycle at night, then listen up. Most unicycles have both a headlight and a rear light. Some may have additional LED lights on the side as well. While some vehicles have self-dimming lights, most don’t. In general, most headlights are bright enough to light up the whole road ahead. However, if you have reservations, most manufacturers tell you the voltage of their lamp.


If you don’t care about that and are more interested in LED lights, well they won’t light up as much, but they will glow in pretty colors. In general, most LED lights are on either side of the wheel. They rotate and blink with colorful patterns. There is also an alternative version, where the LED lights are not on the wheel but rather on the front on either side of the headlight. These do not rotate, but they can blink in a specific pattern. 


In general, you can control the brightness and colors of the LED lights through the mobile app, which most electric unicycle brands have. However, if they are as bad as the 
hoverboard brands
, you might just have to consider sticking with the default. Some electric unicycles will also give you the option of controlling the strength of the headlight and rear light via the mobile app. However, that is a rarity, and you won’t see it apart from the most premium of premium unicycles.


Learning Curve


Obviously, with a mode of transportation as dangerous as the electric unicycle, you would expect a steep learning curve, and you would be right. This device is more difficult to learn than the 
self-balancing scooter
. It is recommended that you practice the unicycle at home or in the yard for a few days or as long as it takes you to get used to it. Balancing is key here and probably the most important part you will learn. After that is tilting your body just enough so that the unicycle can turn. 


As a beginner, it can be pretty terrifying when you first step onto the electric unicycle. It doesn’t help that there are not as many beginner-friendly features as there are in hoverboards, but this doesn’t mean there are none. Some products will help you with balancing, while others with control. This is especially true for the electric unicycles marketed toward kids. 


In the end, no matter how many beginner-friendly functions an electric vehicle has, what’s really important is that you take care of yourself and that you be careful. It is easy to get hurt when riding these things, so always wear your safety gear. Oh, and don’t go at max speed the very second you open the box. Get used to the device, learn its quirks, and then go crazy. This also goes for the veteran riders.

Hoverboards For Adults Who are Kids at Heart,https://10beasts.com/hoverboard-adults/,"

Just because most hoverboards are marketed toward children, doesn’t mean that adults can’t enjoy them as well. In fact, I have a lot to say about top-rated hoverboards, most of which both kids and adults can enjoy. For the moment, if you are looking for the best hoverboard for adults, well, you have come to the right place, my friend. 




Although self-balancing scooters have been around for a while, only recently has their popularity truly exploded. More and more people are getting into this hobby, most of which are adults. Why shouldn’t they? Hoverboards are a fun, clean method of transportation that does not require much effort, that is, when you learn to ride them.


Speaking from experience, that second part is a bit difficult, and you will find yourself on the ground more often than not. Luckily, some brands have you covered with amazing safety and training features, although I will briefly touch upon this for each hoverboard on this list. I have another review about 
self-balancing scooter brands
 that go into more detail, so if you are interested I would recommend taking a look.


As for the hoverboard for adults review, I have put some brands you know and some you have never heard of, but each of these is designed to be great at something and deserves to be considered the best.

The EPIKGO hoverboard has a luxurious design and a tough exterior. It has a pair of 8.5-inch solid rubber tires which are weatherproof and can go over any terrain, ensuring a smooth ride. 


The hoverboard has a maximum weight limit of 240 lbs and is extremely durable with its aluminum frame and ABS chassis, so even if you are the more adventurous type, you can rest assured that the device will last you a long time. You can also rest assured knowing that the company prioritizes safety. In fact, this is one of the safer hoverboards you can currently buy.


With its self-balancing technology, you will have a hard time falling down, and with its water resistance and UL2272 certification, you know it has been through vigorous testing to provide a safer kind of experience.   


Other than that, the EPIKGO hoverboard has a 400-watt dual motor which is capable of up to 10 miles per hour, can climb a 30-degree incline, and is the fastest accelerating self-balancing scooter. Now this may be the fastest accelerating electric scooter, but it is not the fastest out there – no, that honor goes to someone else, someone who deserves the title of fastest hoverboard.


Then there is the battery life that can last a little over an hour for a total range of 12 miles, while charging time is about 1–2 hours – definitely one of the longest range and battery life on this list.


You can, of course, keep track of the battery via the LED indicator or by the mobile app, which, to be honest, is not that great. However, the bluetooth is pretty decent, and I would definitely like to blast some Amon Amarth.


 
 
Pros
 




 Amazing range and battery life

The Jetson Aero All-Terrain Hoverboard is incredibly light and can support a maximum weight capacity of 220 lbs. Its design is minimalistic and simply screams lightweight.


At only 19 lbs, it is the lightest self-balancing scooter I have ever seen, and honestly, I am in love and so are two of my best friends, Sav and Mira. I decided a second or third opinion won’t hurt, so I got a little help with some of the electric scooters.


The self-balancing scooter has a pair of 6.5-inch rubber tires which can make the roughest terrain feel like a smooth ride. Likewise, its 300-watt dual motor can push to a top speed of 7 miles per hour with a 7 mile range per charge. 


Sadly, it does not have a Bluetooth speaker, but I was told to let you know that it has some pretty LED wheels.


When it comes to safety, this hoverboard for adults has you covered with its smart self-balancing technology which uses internal sensors to keep you level and stable. It also comes with a rear brake when you need to come to a sudden stop. Of course, it needs not a mention, but the hoverboard has a UL2272 certification.


If you are anything like me, you like to travel light. In fact you will buy a product just because it reduces some weight, for example, a really lightweight gaming mouse or as it is a hoverboard. I doubt I am alone in this. I also always like to play the fast-moving, dash-and-slash kind of characters in games. If you know, you know, and if you do, this easy-to-use hoverboard is for you.


 
 
Pros
 




 Incredibly lightweight

As a wise man once said to me, “This hoverboard is shaggadelic, baby!” and they were not wrong. If we are judging on a scale of 1 to shaggadelic, the Swagtron T1 definitely leans toward the latter. The self-balancing scooter has a simple design that you simply can’t help but like.


The hoverboard has a maximum weight capacity of 220 lbs. It has solid rubber tires and a 250-watt dual motor. The hoverboard  can climb at a 30-degree incline and has a maximum speed of 8 miles per hour. Its range can be as high as 11 miles, and the battery only takes an hour to fully charge. 


Now, onto arguably the most important part – safety. The Swagtron T1 has to be one of the safest hoverboards to buy. 


There are two modes, a learning one and a standard one. The former limits your max speed until you have become a hoverboard master, while the other is, well, standard. Of course, it is UL-certified, but it also has something called a “Sentry Shield Battery” which monitors and protects the battery from overheating. What’s more, this hoverboard for adults has something called a “Safe Stop Technology,” which means that if you suddenly find yourself spinning out of control, the electric scooter will automatically come to a slow and steady stop. It’s definitely worth the buy if your main concern is safety.


There is also a decent Bluetooth speaker, so you know I will be blasting some badass tunes.


In the end, I believe this is the perfect gift for your favorite loved one, even if that loved one is yourself. The hoverboard is extremely safe and fun to ride, even though its speed is a bit slow. I would definitely give this one a go.

Bet you didn’t expect this plot twist, right? I thought I needed to put this here just in case, but if you want to find out more about the best hoverboards for kids, I would recommend teleporting yourself to this 
link
. What you don’t know is that the TOMOLOO hoverboard has a minimalistic design that, in all honesty, looks great.


 As for the TOMOLOO electric scooter itself, it has a cool design, and it can handle a maximum weight limit of 220 lbs. Its motor power is not the best, and at most, it is capable of only 7.5 miles per hour as well as a maximum range of 4.3 miles per charge. Its slow speed and limited range mean it’s perfect for younger kids who are still falling every time they run.


A great feature of this hoverboard that both adults and kids can enjoy is its amazing Bluetooth speaker. It has a crispy clean audio and decent bass. Trust me, after buying these self-balancing scooters, my neighbors hate me more than they already did.


Now, being a hoverboard for kids and all, TOMOLOO does not skip on its safety features. In fact, they are known as one of the safer hoverboard brands out there. The electric scooter is water-resistant, and it is, of course, UL-certified. It also has silicon non-slip footpads for that extra protection as well as smart self-balancing technology and an acceleration sensor which are designed to optimize your riding experience. 


In the end, if you are an adult who is looking for a gift that will suit a young child, then give this hoverboard a consideration. I know my little niece loves it.

The Xprit Off-Road Hoverboard could be considered a cheaper version of the EPIKGO. It has a slim design which makes its tires look larger than they are.


This budget-friendly self-balancing scooter has a pair of 8.5-inch solid rubber tires that can take you through the gravel, sand, and most terrain, not to mention it can climb a slope with a 15-degree incline. This hoverboard for adults is well built with a maximum weight limit of 264 lbs; however, the manufacturer has a maximum recommended weight capacity of 198 lbs, so you can decide for yourself if it’s worth it.


The self-balancing scooter has a 250-watt dual motor with a top speed of 6 miles per hour and a range of 6 miles. The charging time is nothing great, as it can take up to 3 hours to completely fill up the battery life. So at times, you might find yourself spending more time charging than actually using the hoverboard.


At least it has a Bluetooth speaker ,so you can play your favorite Spotify playlist. However, it doesn’t have an app, which at this point is an advantage when compared to the hoverboards that have one. If you are confused as to what I am talking about, you probably haven’t seen my 
best hoverboard brand review
.


The Xprit self-balancing scooter may not have some more extraordinary safety features, but it is UL-certified, and it has smart, safe balancing technology, which in my opinion is more than enough.


In the end, I would say that this is a great-budget friendly hoverboard for anyone – adult or child.

The Segway Ninebot S Electric Transporter is a unique kind of hoverboard in that it has a large stick sticking out of its middle. That stick is mainly used for stirring with your knees, for extra control and safety, although some might find it a bit annoying. You can also use it to carry the self-balancing scooter wherever you go. Personally, I use it for both, and if you buy an attachment which you may find 
here
, you can turn it into a go-kart, and then the stick acts as a steering wheel.


Other than that, this hoverboard for adults has a 400-watt dual motor that is capable of a top speed of 10 mph as well as an almost 14-mile range, not to mention it can climb up to a 15-degree incline. It can handle a maximum weight of 220 lbs, perfect for the average adult, and even though it looks heavy, it’s actually on the lighter side, so you can carry it wherever you go.


Then there is the battery which is amazing, and it will last you much longer than just a single hour. Its charging time is also pretty decent. You can, of course, track the battery life via the app which has an anti-theft function, speed sensor, vehicle self-diagnose, firmware upgrade, Ambient Light, vehicle remote control, and much more. I have to say this is one of the better ones out there.


The hoverboard is also great for safety; it is of course UL-certified and has a water resistance level of IP54. The battery also has an extra layer of protection, and all around, the self-balancing scooter is sturdy and durable – not to mention that the anti-theft function might come in handy.

The VIRO Rides Free-Style hoverboard has a unique design – the two wheels, instead of being on either end, are placed in the middle. Yes, exactly like a snowboard. 


This hoverboard for adults has a not-that-powerful motor which can push it to a maximum speed of 7 miles per hour, while its rugged tires will ensure a smooth ride. As for range, it’s a bit disappointing with only 6.5 miles per charge. 


Other than that, the self-balancing scooter can handle a maximum weight of 220 lbs and a minimum of 55 lbs, perfect for the average adult. What’s even more surprising is that this hoverboard is extremely lightweight, but so far, it is looking as if that and the unique design are its only quality features – well, that and the fact that it has a LED display which you can use to track the speed and battery life.


Then there are the unique LED lights on both ends, which will pull when the device is not moving. Likewise, when you are turning, they will light up in the given direction. That’s actually a pretty good feature that I am surprised more hoverboards don’t have.


Sadly, you can’t track the battery via the mobile app because it doesn’t have one. But you can still blast your favorite tunes via the Bluetooth speaker.


As for safety, the self-balancing scooter for adults is UL-certified and has some extra foot control. Apart from that, the water resistance is nonexistent. 


Now, the price is nothing like the EPIKGO, but I would not exactly call it budget-friendly. For what it’s going to be, you can find better versions of this one. Still, if you are someone who is used to snowboarding and this is your first hoverboard, I think you will find this one a lot easier to use than the others.

The Swagtron T6 off-road hoverboard could be considered, by every definition of the word, a beast. This is a big self-balancing scooter, big and heavy. It has a simple design with two big LED lights on the front. The hoverboard is great and all, but if it dies on you during a trip, you won’t be able to carry it back home by yourself.


It has a pair of 10-inch rubber shock-absorbent tires, which are reinforced with alloy steel and are nylon-infused. They can travel across any terrain, no matter what – gravel, rocks, mud, you name it. It has a 300-watt dual motor with a top speed of 12 miles per hour and can push up a  30-degree incline. 


The Swagtron self-balancing scooter also has a maximum range of 12 miles per charge. You can monitor the battery levels via the indicator or simply by the mobile app as well. It also has a charging time of 2–3 hours which is not ideal, but considering, it is well worth the wait.


Apart from checking the battery levels, you can also use the mobile app to see the distance traveled and your current speed and, of course, play music on the Bluetooth speaker. 


Then there is the fact that this hoverboard can support adults of up to 420 lbs or a maximum of 6 children although I would not recommend that.


That’s not all because for the Swagtron T6, safety is a priority. The hoverboard is of course UL-certified and has smart self-balancing technology. It is also water-resistant, and the battery has the Sentry Shield protection system.

View on Halo Board






The Halo Rover X all-terrain hoverboard could have easily taken the number one spot on this list, but there is one more hoverboard that I believe is better in almost every regard. As for the Rover X, it has a luxurious design similar to the EPIKGO as well as a similar luxurious price. 


This particular hoverboard for adults can support a weight range from 44 lbs to 260 lbs. It has a pair of 8.5-inch rugged tires which are designed for even the most uneven terrain out there – gravel, sand, you name it. Likewise, its 400-watt dual motor can push to a top speed of 10 miles per hour and climb up a 20-degree incline. 


The Halo all-terrain hoverboard has a range of 10 miles and a charging time of around 2.5 hours. 


Tracking your battery life is easy with the mobile app, which you can also use to track your speed and distance, to pick a route, or to simply power on and off the hoverboard.  


Of course, you can also play your favorite tunes with the admittedly great Bluetooth speaker. I personally used it to listen to my new favorite genre, Japanese rap, more specifically MIYACHI and Hideyoshi – what can I say, I like listening to all kinds of music. 


The Halo board does not skimp on safety. It has three modes – beginner, normal, and advanced, each with their own level of difficulty. It goes without saying, but for new riders, obviously, they should start with the beginner mode.


The hoverboard is also UL-certified and it has fireproof batteries for an extra layer of safety. If you are looking for a premium brand with a lot to offer, then this is the perfect choice.

The Hovertrax 2.0 is by far the most popular and most well-built hoverboard currently on the market. It has memorable design as well as tremendous value. It is a premium-quality self-balancing scooter with a budget-friendly price.


The Razor Hovertrax hoverboard has a silent 350-watt dual motor that has a top speed of 8 mph as well as an 8-mile range, not to mention you won’t hear this thing even if you are standing right next to it. It can handle a maximum weight of 220 lbs, perfect for the average adult. The Razor hoverboard is also extremely lightweight at 19.5 lbs, which is just 0.5 pounds heavier than the lightest hoverboard.


As for the lithium-ion battery, well, it is replaceable. If for some reason it runs out on you while you are enjoying a smooth ride, you can easily change it with a spare. Normally, it would be next to impossible to change batteries on the go, but Razor has made it a really easy thing to do.


Then there is the app which is not the best but, in some cases, is still better than all the others. However, you can still play your favorite tunes on the Bluetooth speaker.


A great thing about this self-balancing scooter for adults is that it has incredible safety features. Of course, it has the UL2272 certification as well as the UL2271 battery certificate. Much more than that, the Razor hoverboard’s exclusive EverBalance technology, which essentially acts as a smart self-balancing technology, makes it easier to mount and ensures a smooth ride. 


The electric scooter also has a pair of non-slip rubber footpads, as well as a training mode which will put a limit on the max speed.

Best Hoverboard for Adults – Buyer’s Guide


For this buyer’s guide, I will go into some detail, but I won’t be able to cover every feature. If you are looking for a more in-depth version, you can always go to my 
best self-balancing scooters article
. That is only if you want to find out more in greater detail.


Which Hoverboards Are Safe?


Now, this is a difficult question to answer. I would have to say none and most. You see, hoverboards are inherently dangerous. They are easy to fall off, and their batteries are unstable. There is a reason why self-balancing scooters are not allowed on planes. Also, since their inception, a great deal of care has been taken to make sure all the electric scooters out there are as safe as they can possibly be.


You see, there is a system in place to make sure the manufacturers meet specific standards. You might have seen the certificate that comes along with those standards, the most common being UL2272 which is only awarded to manufactures that pass a plethora of safety tests, including electronic, mechanical, and environmental. There is also the less common UL2271 certification which proves that the battery is explosion- and fire-protected. Now, what happens if a hoverboard does not have these certificates? Well, nothing really. There is no law requiring a product to have it, but you should never, and I mean NEVER, buy one that is not UL2272-certified.


Most hoverboards also have additional safety features for extra protection, such as non-slip footpads and smart, self-balancing technology. Some go the extra mile and have additional software that protects your hoverboard and warns you when it can’t. You should take your time when choosing a hoverboard and look properly at its safety features.


Weight Limit


When buying a hoverboard, you should also consider the weight limit as it too plays a part in your safety. It goes without saying, but you should never exceed the maximum weight capacity. In fact, you should never even come close to it, which may put extra strain on your self-balancing scooter which it may not handle. So if you are planning on riding your hoverboard with a heavy backpack or something like it, you should make sure not to exceed the maximum limit.


Now, generally, the max limit is around the 200-lbs range, but some go lower, and some can go up to 300+ lbs. 


If for some reason a hoverboard does not list the maximum weight, then it won’t hurt to email the company about it and ask. That also goes for any information that they might have failed to show.


Speed


Now, we have speed. When it comes to how fast a self-balancing scooter is, you might think that it depends slowly on the motor power, and while that places a large part, other factors like the battery and wheels, not to mention the load, will play a part. 


In general, most hoverboards are in the 6–10 mph range. The more budget-friendly versions are a bit slower than the more luxurious ones. Of course, there are some that can go even faster, but those are a bit of a rarity.


The speed will also be a factor in the slope your hoverboard can go upon. Most are capable of pushing through a 10–30-degree incline, and you should definitely not exceed the given limit. Also, remember to take your time on your first hill. There’s no need to rush it.


Battery


One last extremely important factor to consider is, of course, the battery. Now, most self-balancing scooters are equipped with lithium ion batteries, and those can be pretty dangerous and explosive. So, as mentioned before, it is very important that your hoverboard is UL-certified. You should never, and I mean never, buy one that doesn’t have this certificate, even if it resembles a cheap Hovertrax.


When looking at the batteries, you should know that a proper one will have a decent life with a short charging time. More often than not, you should look for a hoverboard that takes around  1–3 hours to fully charge and up to 1 hour of battery life or more. 


The battery will also determine the range of your self-balancing scooter. Most hoverboards can run 7–15 miles on a single charge, so that will give you some perspective. However, if you are thinking of going on a longer trip, you should definitely look into a much higher range or a brand that allows you to change it if it runs out and recharge it when you go back home.

Best Hoverboard for Kids of the Non-hovering Variety,https://10beasts.com/best-hoverboard-kids/,"



Well, I can’t say it’s exactly like 
Back to the Future 
predicted but as long as it works. Hoverboards have taken the world by storm, replacing the electric scooter and segway as the best alternative mode of transportation, especially among children, so much so that there is no way I would miss the opportunity to write about the best hoverboard for kids or, as my grandma calls them, self-balancing scooters—that is when she’s not referring to them as dangerous death machines.


There is no denying that these non-hovering hoverboards have recently exploded in popularity, especially when you consider that my grandma, who doesn’t even watch TV, knows about them. Nowadays, more and more adults are getting into the dangerous death machines, and with so many to choose from, it can be hard to find one that suits you as an adult. Luckily, you have me, and I make it my job to know which are 
the best hoverboards
 for you. However,even I was surprised to learn of the many varieties of self-balancing scooters, such as the off-road or all-terrain version and the hoverboard go-kart—which functions as a go-kart but has a hoverboard for wheels. Yeah, I don’t get it either.


No matter what attachments there are (and there are a lot of them), in its simplest form, the hoverboard is an alternative transportation method for kids. Thus, I wonder to myself, “Which one is actually the best hoverboard for kids?”

It would be a waste if you used the EPIKGO Self-Balancing Scooter on a smoothly paved road. This hoverboard has some pretty tough alloy wheels that guarantee a smooth ride at max speed even on the worst kind of terrain. Its dual motor and streamlined rubber tires make it 80% faster than competitors or so claims EPIKGO. Honestly, with the price tag it has, I would be inclined to believe them.


This kids’ hoverboard is capable of climbing 15-degree slopes and can easily travel through grass, mud, and sand. With its IP56 water resistance, you won’t have to worry about taking it out in the rain or in the shower if you don’t want to walk five steps. For folks with large homes, you don’t have to worry. With its 10-mile range and almost 2 hours of battery life on a single charge, the EPIKGO can take you to the shower without issues. Honestly, this is one of the best batteries I have seen in a hoverboard.


Speaking of the battery, it recharges reasonably fast. after 2–3 hours, you are good to go, or should I say EpikGO… I will see myself out. The hoverboard also has a small battery indicator that lets you know how much charge it has left. Honestly, I think that battery indicator is the best feature this hoverboard has because unlike electric scooters, it is unusable once it’s dead. That’s not such a problem for most kids’ hoverboards as they can pick them up and carry them back home—not an option for the EPIKGO, no sir. The manufacturer prides itself on having one of the largest self-balancing scooters out there, which is not necessarily a good thing. Even I had trouble carrying this thing, imagine if the hoverboard’s battery ran out in the middle of nowhere. The kid would have to leave it there.


Not to worry though because the board is UL2272-certified which means it’s completely safe, and there is no chance of any fire hazards. The EPIKGO scooter also has some bright led lights on the front which will make it stand out even in the darkest of alleys. All in all, this seems like a pretty safe hoverboard. Even so, you should make sure you are wearing your safety gear.

If you are looking for an affordable hoverboard for the whole family, then you have come to the right place. With a weight limit of up to 250 lbs, the JOLEGE Self-Balancing Hoverboard can be used by both young and old alike. The kid’s hoverboard is specifically designed for beginners. The board can handle a maximum weight of 250 lbs, so even a grown man—like me—can enjoy.


The rubber tires provide excellent traction; however, I would not recommend going off-road with them. Believe me… I tried. Nevertheless, they are great for the paved roads of the city. The wheels also light up which, apart from providing additional protection during nighttime, also looks pretty cool. What? I’m a grown man; I’m not afraid to admit it. The lil’ kids hoverboard can also rotate at 360 degrees, and the rubber pedals are slip-resistant. The only problem I have is with the front LED lights. They are significantly smaller than similar models and are not as bright. Honestly, if I was a dad, I would be a bit worried, but maybe that’s just me being overprotective of my hypothetical children.


Other than that, this is a hoverboard with Bluetooth. The feature is optional and it will affect the pricing. Personally, I used the Bluetooth speaker to blast Sabaton while riding my light-up, pink kids’ segway through the neighborhood—just because I thought it would be funny, but to each their own. 


This self-balance scooter with Bluetooth is also resistant to dust, solid objects, and splashing water, so even if it’s raining, you can go for a stroll. Of course, it has the UL2272 certification so you know it’s as safe as it can be.


The lithium-ion battery on this hoverboard is surprisingly good. Generally, a single charge can last from 2 to 3 hours, with a 6–9-mile range per charge.


The board is also really affordable, and I would recommend it to any little fellow and fellowine. You will have a great time riding it, and it is perfect for beginners. Whether you are young or old, I am sure you will have a good time—especially with those shiny wheels.

Now here is a self-balancing hoverboard that looks a bit different than the rest. Don’t worry, this is still a hoverboard—despite what the manufacturer claims.


The non-hover hoverboard looks pretty standard apart from the saddle striking out in the middle. For a fully grown man, the saddle stick will be around your knee. I honestly don’t know what the point is. They claim it helps with balancing, but personally, I found it a bit annoying. I never had a problem with balancing on normal hoverboards, but that’s just me. You would have to decide for yourself. The Segway miniPRO’s saddle stick can also function as a handle when you are not riding it, so there is that. When it comes to kids, my little nephew enjoyed the ride and pretended he was on a spaceship, but then again, I also can see it being uncomfortable for the little ones.


Other than that, the Segway miniPRO can handle a maximum weight of 220 pounds, so it’s perfect for both kids and adults alike. This hoverboard for kids can take you anywhere with its 800-watt dual motor and 10.5” vacuum tires. It can climb 15-degree slopes, and it can turn every bump into a smooth ride. The powerful watt motors of the hoverboard deliver a maximum speed of 10 miles per hour, making it one of the fastest on this list.


However, the Segway miniPRO falls a little short with its Bluetooth speaker. Despite its price and the fact that it’s marketed as a hoverboard with Bluetooth, its connection is a bit lacking. This sucks, even more when you consider that the free app that comes with the self-balancing segway also uses the same connection.


While the hoverboard has a UL certification, it lacks some safety features to make it more appealing for kids. However, it does have two sets of bright LED lights—at the back and the front.


As for the lithium-ion battery, it can take you up to 14 miles on a single charge, and it takes around 4 hours to fully charge. The battery life is the longest I have seen, so you know it will last you a long time.


In the end, I would take some time to think about buying this for my child. It may not be the best option on this list.

The SISIGAD Pure Color Series is an inoffensive, inexpensive hoverboard that covers all the basics. With a weight limit of 260 pounds, it can handle any child or adult that may come its way.


The hoverboard comes in a couple of mono colors as well as a few variations—including a “fun” version and an off-road one.n my humble opinion, the standard pure color version works best. No matter the variation, you will receive a reliable hoverboard with self-balancing technology—perfect for beginners.


This children’s hoverboard has 2-watt motors with a top speed of 10 miles per hour; however, its range is only 9 miles, and that is mainly due to the battery which does not last long. Although the battery is a bit disappointing in that it doesn’t even last an hour and takes up to 5 hours to charge, I think it’s perfect for riding along in the neighborhood. You don’t have to worry about it running out in the middle of nowhere as the hoverboard will keep you informed of the battery level via a small LED light on its surface. Likewise, you don’t have to worry about rain or mud either. The self-balancing scooter is water-resistant, and its rubber tires can travel across small obstacles, like mud, grass, and even gravel.


If you are also a fan of blasting Sabaton on your hoverboard, then you are in luck. This bad boy has a pretty decent Bluetooth speaker which you can connect to your phone and play whatever you would like.


When it comes to safety, this self-balance scooter with Bluetooth is what you would expect. It has shiny spinning wheels as well as two LED headlights, although they are a bit small. The SISIGAD also has some bright LED lights on top of the two wheels, so you are assured that even during the night, little Jimmy will be safe. Of course, the hoverboard also has a UL certification as well as nonslip footpads.


All in all, I think this is a great hoverboard for beginners. If you have never ridden an electric scooter before, then I would definitely recommend this one as your first; otherwise, you can check some of the other options on this hoverboard review.

Other than having a swag name, the manufacturer claims that their hoverboard was the first one to receive a UL2272 certification, and judging by the number of safety features this self-balancing hoverboard has, I am inclined to believe them.


The Swagtron Swagboard—I love that name—can handle a maximum weight of 220 pounds, perfect for kids and adults alike. The hoverboard also has solid rubber tires and can climb at a 30-degree incline, but I have to admit, it stumbles a bit when it comes to its watt motors. It, however, has an admittedly pretty incredible range at 7–11 miles on a single charge, and the battery only takes an hour to fully charge. However, the 250-watt motors are a bit of a disappointment. At its best, the self-balancing hoverboard can reach a top speed of 8 miles per hour; however, you will find that most of the time, even that might be a challenge. There is also the argument that slower speeds are generally safer for kids—but if you ask my nephew, he will disagree—the lil’ dude’s a racing maniac.


When it comes to safety features, this swaggish kids segway has every other beat. There is a learning mode and a standard mode. The former limits your max speed until you have mastered the art of hoverboarding. Of course, the electric scooter is UL-certified, but it also has something called a “Sentry Shield Battery” which monitors and protects the battery. According to the manufacturer, this hoverboard has survived a 10-ton crash test, you know if suddenly you find 5 elephants on your hoverboard, you wouldn’t want the battery to explode… right? Other than that, the Swagboard also has something called a “Safe Stop Technology.” This is a function that activates if you suddenly find yourself out of control. The electric scooter will automatically come to a slow and steady stop, so you can be assured that no matter what, your baby will be protected.  This hoverboard for kids also has a pair of small LED headlights, so you will be visible even at night. 


In the end, I would recommend this hoverboard to any parent who is seeking that extra layer of protection for their child. Just remember to always bring your safety gear, especially at night.

Apart from having a very slick design, this is the best hoverboard with Bluetooth out there. Personally, I am partial to the black version, but no matter what color you choose, this will be the best-looking hoverboard you will have—yes, it is even more swaggish than the Swagboard.


This electric scooter can handle a weight limit of 220 pounds and has acceleration sensors and of course self-balancing technology. However, its top speed is not the best at just 7.5 miles per hour; it’s one of the slowest on this hoverboard review. The Rhythmed hoverboard also has a maximum range of 4.3 miles per charge of its lithium-ion battery, which is probably the lowest range I have seen on a kids’ segway. That is not necessarily a bad thing. Having a slower speed means it’s that much safer for smaller children. Meaning, this is the perfect hoverboard for 6-year-olds or even 5-year-olds.


However, where this hoverboard truly shines is with its amazing Bluetooth speaker. It has the newest 4.2 Bluetooth Technology which brings you an amazing stereo sound—trust me, my neighbors hate me now. That’s not all. The Rhythmed hoverboard’s LED lights change with the volume of the music, so you will have your own disco at home. There are two LED headlights and LED wheels, all of which are brighter than my future, so you will definitely be safe during the night.


Other than that, this hoverboard with Bluetooth has all the safety features covered. It is water-resistant, and it has UL certification. It also has non-slip silicon footpads for that extra protection. Even so, I would always recommend you wear your safety gear no matter what.


So who would I recommend this hoverboard with Bluetooth to? Well, if you are looking for a disco machine that moves you around the neighborhood, then look no further. The Bluetooth speaker combined with the LED lights is perfect for those of us who want to show off, but if you are looking for the best hoverboard for kids, I simply cannot recommend this one due to its limited range and speed.

The Q2-C can largely be considered the big brother of the Rhythmed hoverboard. Although the two do have their differences, none is better than the other they, and are both perfect for younger kids. 


Personally, I believe that this TOMOLOO hoverboard has a better design than the Rhythmed one. The manufacturer claims that it was inspired by the fire Kylin Chinese myth—which is supposed to symbolize an invincible aggressiveness and a free spirit. I don’t know how aggressive this segway is as it has a top speed of 7.5 miles per hour—just like its brother. However, unlike the Rhythmed hoverboard, this one has an increased range of 7.5 miles. When you factor in the lithium-ion battery which can last up to 2 hours on a single charge, the range essentially doubles for a total of 15 miles per charge. Of course, this will vary a bit depending on a plethora of factors. Still, seeing that increase of range makes me extremely jubilant— I’ve always wanted to use that word.


The electric scooter can handle a maximum weight of 165 lbs, which means some adults won’t be able to experience the jubilation of the 15 miles per charge. However,  they can experience the Bluetooth speaker, which quite frankly makes you feel like a free spirit. Like the Rhythmed hoverboard, this one has the newest Bluetooth technology, and its LED lights change with the volume.


Speaking of which, the LED headlights are a bit on the smaller side, but nothing too bad. There is also the battery indicator which is right under you once you hop on the electric scooter. The only problem I can surmise here is that the charging time is around 3.5–4 hours, which is not great especially if you have a hyperactive child who just wants to ride their hoverboard.


Other than that, this is one of the safest self-balancing scooters with Bluetooth. Of course, it has the UL safety certificate as well as the wonderful self-balancing technology and a smart battery management system, which protects against overheating and such.


I think this is the perfect hoverboard for 5-year-olds. It has some great safety features, and you can enjoy a smooth ride, not to mention it is affordable. The cheap hoverboard is a great addition to the list, but it’s not the best.

Now, here is a hoverboard that’s meant for the adventurous type. The Jetson Aero can go anywhere, and it will last you a long time. The self-balancing scooter has a pair of 6.5″ all-terrain rubber tires that can go off-road, through mud, rocks, and gravel, while the 300-watt dual motor will make you feel as if you are going faster than you are. So if your favorite child likes exploring, then your kid will have a blast with this one. Likewise, you don’t have to worry about them venturing too far, with only a 7-mile range and max speed of 7 mph. So far, in this hoverboard review, I have been hard on those that have a limited range and a slower speed, but even I need to admit that it’s not always a bad thing. 


The most amazing part of this electric scooter is probably the lithium-ion battery. It is safe to say that the Jeston Aero will last you a long while, up to 2 days on a single charge to be more precise—no you did not read that wrong. The battery indicator will let you know when it’s time to take a break, but the charging time is as long as the battery life itself—well not exactly, but it can last up to 7 hours, so you will need to let it charge during bedtime.


This kids’ hoverboard has 2 bright LED headlights as well as some colorful LED wheels but sadly no Bluetooth speaker to accompany them. The LED lights are more than enough to ensure you are visible during nighttime.


The electric scooter is also UL-certified and has a pair of nonslip footpads. The self-balancing technology will make sure you don’t fall down on your butt. 


This is a great hoverboard for the adventurous type despite its low range and slow speed—yes I am still going to complain about that, especially for a hoverboard that is meant for exploring.

I will be honest with you, this is my second choice for the best hoverboard for kids. It is quite, frankly speaking, a pretty good off-road self-balancing scooter, and it looks tough. 


The hoverboard is equipped with 8.5-inch solid tires and has a pair of 350 dual-watt motors, so if you want to go somewhere, this monstrosity will get you there. The self-balancing technology ensures that no matter where you find yourself, gravel, rock, or dirt, you experience a smooth ride. The self-balancing scooter has a metal and aluminum frame, making it one of the heaviest out there, and can handle a maximum weight of 265 pounds while climbing at a 30-degree angle.


The hoverboard has a max speed of 9.95 miles per hour and can reach up to 9.5 miles on a single charge. The lithium-ion battery itself takes around 1 to 2 hours to fully charge. The electric scooter also comes with a pro-Bluetooth speaker—imagine blasting Sabaton while in the woods or, I don’t know, Miley Cyrus. What do kids like these days? 


Apart from the battery indicator, this hoverboard with Bluetooth has a pair of bright LED lights to illuminate your way in the dark.


Other than that, it has the typical UL certification and is water-resistant. However, it appears to lack some of the safety features that other hoverboards have. Then again, this one is meant for a slightly older demographic. Just remember to always wear your safety gear.


So who would I recommend this to? It would be best for slightly older kids—that is to say, teens who like going off-road. That doesn’t mean that this hoverboard can’t be used on a perfectly paved street. On the contrary, you can even use it at home, but you won’t be taking advantage of its full capabilities.

The Hovertrax 2.0 is sold and manufactured by Razor who is easily becoming one of the best hoverboard brands for kids. They are not to be confused with Razer though who is one of the 
best gaming mice manufacturers
. I am sensing a pattern here, but I digress. As for the Hovertrax 2.0, it is easily in my opinion the best hoverboard for kids.


You should know that this one is not meant for lightning-fast speeds nor an off-road adventure. Instead, the best hoverboard for kids features silent dual motors that have a top speed of 8 mph as well as an 8-mile range on a hoverboard that’s meant for children 8 years old or older—I see what you did there.


Admittedly, it’s not the fastest but not the slowest either. The 350-watt motors ensure a quiet and smooth ride. 


The Razor hoverboard can handle a maximum weight of 220 pounds, although I don’t know why any adult would want to get on this thing as it is mainly meant for young children. 


The fact that the Razor segway is targeted at a younger demographic is also enforced by its incredible safety features. Of course, the board has a UL2272 certification, but much more than that, Razor’s exclusive EverBalance technology makes it easier to mount and ensures a smooth ride. The hoverboard also has nonslip rubber footpads, which essentially adds an extra layer of safety. Then, there is the so-called training mode which will put a limit on the max speed, making it easier for beginners. The self-balancing scooter also has two LED headlights on the front, making it a reliable hoverboard even at night, just don’t forget your safety gear.


The lithium-ion battery has a max life of about 60 minutes on a single charge. Of course, there is a battery indicator to let you know when it is running out. If for some reason it does run out on you while outside, you can easily replace it with an extra battery. Normally it would be next to impossible to change batteries on the go, but Razor has made it a really easy thing to do.


Oh, did I forget to mention that the Razor hoverboard’s lithium-ion battery is also UL2271 certified? Essentially this hoverboard has two UL certifications, making it one of the safest on the market.


 
 
Pros
 




 Super safe


 Affordable


 Training mode


 Silent




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Limited battery




 
 
 


Buyer’s Guide


Safety


When it comes to hoverboards, safety is the most important factor. Luckily there is a system in place to make sure the manufacturers meet specific standards. You might have seen the certificate that comes along with those standards, mentioned through this hoverboard review. The UL2272 is only awarded to manufactures that pass a plethora of safety tests, including electronic, mechanical, and environmental. You should never, and I mean NEVER, consider buying a self-balancing scooter that does not have that certificate, especially one for your kid. The UL2272 is not the only safety net hoverboards have. Some machines like the Razor Hoverboard have extra safety features on top of the certificate. 


Although I cannot recommend riding at night, most hoverboards have some form of LED lights, and most of the time, that is sufficient so you will be fully visible in the dark. Sometimes, though, the LED headlights are not bright enough or simply too small. If that is the case, then I would definitely recommend you stay home for the night or at least wear a light-up vest when going out.


This brings me to my next point. No matter how safe a hoverboard may seem, always remember to wear your safety gear—your helmet, knee pads, wrist guards, and elbow pads. It’s very important that your helmet fits neatly on your head to avoid serious injury. I hate to say this, but you are probably going to fall. It’s normal, especially for a kid—those little critters find themselves on the ground more often than not, but I don’t have to tell you that. When they do fall, it’s important to be as safe-proof as possible, and your safety gear will make sure of that.


Hoverboards, even those for kids, can be difficult to ride at first, so it is very important that you practice, practice, and practice in a controlled environment—preferably at home. Trust me, they are much more difficult than they look. When I tried a hoverboard for the first time, I kissed the ground at least a dozen times and then some before getting the hang of it. So, yes, practice is king.


Now I probably don’t have to tell you this, but stay away from traffic. Obviously, hoverboards don’t belong on the road where cars are speeding at 100 miles per hour. In some places, it’s even illegal to ride your self-balancing scooter on public roads. This brings me to my next point, OBEY THE LAW. 


Depending on where you live, there will be strict restrictions on hoverboards. Make sure you are up to date with the rules and regulations in your region, and stick to sidewalks, bikeways, and parks. 


Remember to always ride below the top speed, and you should definitely not be exceeding it—although most hoverboards won’t let you do that. Sorry to break it to you, but you are not Speedy Gonzales. Also, remember that if the hoverboard overheats, leave it be, and get away from it as fast as you can—lithium-ion batteries are inherently unstable, and the fact that it is overheating is not good at all. However, if you follow all the safety guidelines, it shouldn’t do that. Carefully read the warnings that the manufacturer provides for you, and mind your speed.


Likewise, do not exceed the weight limit. I know that this hoverboard review is meant for kids, but I somehow know some adults are reading this thinking if they should get one for themselves, which is alright as long as you don’t exceed the weight limit. It is called a limit for a reason.


Best Hoverboard Brands for Kids


There are as many hoverboard brands as there are stars in the sky—spoiler alert: not actually. But there are a lot of them, and it can be hard to determine which ones are best for kids. If you would like to find out more about the hoverboard brands as a whole, go to the best hoverboard brand article.


Kids riding hoverboards can be a nightmare for them and for that innocent bystander they decided to crash into—you know this has probably happened. Now, just mix in a little not paying attention with overexcitement and boom, you have a recipe for disaster.


Luckily, the best hoverboard brands for kids include a ton of safety features as well as a training mode which will help your little disaster waiting to happen and be less at risk. The best brands also have nonslip footpads, so it would be less likely that the kid will fall.


When you get down from the hoverboard and into the house, you will find that manufacturers like Razor, Tomoloo, and Swagtron have amazing 24-hour customer support. The best brands are not only those who produce the best self-balancing scooters but also stay with you as long as you have their hoverboard. 


You should be able to contact them and ask for a return, send it for repair, or simply ask a question any hour of any day. This, of course, holds true to any brand, not just a hoverboard.


The best hoverboard brands for kids are also those who prioritize safety above anything else. Razor, TOMOLOOo, and Swagtron can be considered the leading experts in this field. When it comes to safety features, they have all the other beat. There is a reason the Razor hoverboard is my number one pick.


A good way to find out if a brand is a good choice for you is simply by looking at the reviews it has. Also, the most important thing you should look for is whether their customer support is good and fast or has bad reviews.


All three brands (Razor, TOMOLOO, and Swagtron) have amazing customer support, and many more companies should follow their example.

11 Best Beard Trimmers for Men in 2022 – The Full Guide


And now, my full guide on the best beard trimmers in the world… probably.


1. 
Philips Norelco OneBlade Hybrid Electric Trimmer
 – Best Overall Beard Trimmer
















$37.99




View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








The OneBlade is, in effect, an affordable all-in-one trimmer that 
works for any length of facial hair
. In a nutshell, it uses a dual-sided blade and several detachable guards to help you keep your beard hair at the ideal length for your needs and personal aesthetic.


Through its electric shaving power, using it as a stubble trimmer or for your beard every morning or every few days is 
quick and easy
. The blade at the heart of the device is durable enough to last around four months of normal use.


Because of its versatility, ease-of-use and durability, it’s perhaps the best beard trimmer on Amazon, all things considered.


Features


Where to start? The OneBlade comes with a long-lasting battery that can work 
for 45 minutes under an eight-hour charge
. Thus, leaving it to recharge overnight is perfect if/when the battery ever dies.


The trimmer itself is also designed with 
a 
contour edging
 head
. This essentially helps the precision trimmer blade follow the shape of your jawline. This way, you won’t have any straggler facial hairs left around, even if you’re going for a particularly close shave.


As mentioned, it also comes with three guard combs: 1 mm for a very tight trim, 3 mm for stubble, and 5 mm if you want to keep a little more length to your stubble for a rugged look.


 
 
Pros
 




 The trimmer is durable overall. Blades should last for four months, and it’s water-resistant


 It comes with plenty of guard combs for personalization


 Battery life should last for a while (around 45 minutes)




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 It’s not great for close shaving compared to a regular razor


 Takes a long time to charge (8 hours)




 
 
 


All in all, the OneBlade is a solid and versatile electric beard trimmer, ideal for guys who like a little bit of stubble or who enjoy keeping their facial hair close to clean-shaven. The affordable price, usability in water, and gentle electric touch means that there are almost no downsides.


Its speed, durability, and ease-of-use make it an ideal pick for men without a lot of patience with their morning routine. 


2. 
Panasonic Cordless Men’s Beard Trimmer with Precision Dial
 – Best Beard Trimmer For Stubble
















$53.46




View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








This is one of the best precision beard trimmers for personalized beard cutting and sculpting; it comes with 
19 settings
! A plethora of excellent design choices, like its masculine shape and rubberized grip, means that it’s easy to take charge of your facial hair’s appearance with this beard trimmer kit.


It has 
a matching charging and storage stand
. Plus, its small size and light weight mean it’s a great travel companion as well. This is the trimming tool for men who enjoy being able to control the shape of every hair on their faces. 


Features


For starters, this trimmer comes with 19 settings you can adjust using an integrated dial positioned right on the handle. So, swapping precision settings is quick and easy.


The trimmer also comes with a 
snap-on 
adjustable comb
. This is ideal for cutting through straggler hairs around the corner of your jaw. Alternatively, you can use the comb to raise up any flat hair that is more difficult to cut than average.


This trimmer also comes with a 
matching AC charger
. This plugs right into the wall outlet and acts as a separate stand to prevent the trimmer from getting wet on your bathroom counter. It’s stylish and convenient.


 
 
Pros
 




 Has a rubberized/ergonomic handle, which improves user comfort


 Can be used entirely in water


 Blades are hypoallergenic and very sharp


 You can clean the blade in seconds thanks to the water drain




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Not ideal for longer beards


 No Li-ion battery




 
 
 


All in all, this customizable trimmer is a 
great choice for guys with close facial hair
 that need a clean, quick shave relatively often. It’s a comfortable tool and a good pick for a staple cutting instrument, along with a solid travel trimmer, all in the same purchase.


I’d easily recommend this for men who have close, rough facial hair that they have difficulty trimming with other electric tools. The combs and attachments make even stubborn or flat hairs disappear with a single pass. I’d also recommend this for guys who like wet shaving or trimming in the shower.


3. 
Wahl Professional 5-Star Detailer with Adjustable T Blade
 – Best Beard Trimmer for Line Ups
















$64.40




View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








The Wahl 5-Star Detailer is a 
professional beard trimmer
 
for barbers
 as well as normal guys through and through. It’s a compact trimmer with one of the most 
unique aesthetics
 on the market. Besides this, it offers tons of accessories that professional barbers or guys at home will both appreciate.


Since it weighs just 6.9 ounces, this electric rotary shaver is easy to use over long trimming sessions. It has a rotary motor blade and a chemical-resistant power cord. In short, it’s a powerful but precision-capable trimming tool for your face.


Features


As mentioned, this professional trimmer for barbers comes with a 
rotary motor
, meaning the trimmer rotates the blades in a circular motion. This creates an extremely close shave. As one of the best adjustable beard trimmers, the 
blade used is extra wide
 and is adjustable to your liking or the shape of your face.


It also comes with three of the best beard trimmer attachment combs I’ve seen, measured at 1/16 of an inch, 1/8 of an inch, and 3/16 of an inch, respectively. This allows you to vary your beard lengths depending on your personal aesthetic.


An 
additional cleaning brush, clipper blade oil, and a red blade guard
 round out the set. These will let you keep the tool clean – a particularly nice addition if you are purchasing this as a professional barber.


 
 
Pros
 




 Trimmer is durable, with a long power cord (8-feet)


 Rotary motor makes it one of the 
best long beard trimmers


 Trimmer is lightweight, making it easy to use




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Cord can get in the way and limits your movement to some extent


 Can’t use the trimmer in the shower




 
 
 


It’s not an ideal tool for men who only shave every once in a while. But otherwise, it’s an excellent electric trimmer and the 
best corded beard trimmer
, bar none. The stylish design, excellent functionality, and additional accessories make it a great purchase through and through. 


As you might expect, this trimmer is an excellent choice if you are a professional barber. The additional combs and cleaning supplies will save you a bit of money in the long run.


4. 
Remington MB6850 Vacuum Stubble and Beard Trimmer
 – Best Tidy Beard Trimmer
















$59.99




View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








The Remington MB6850 is an advanced and innovative trimming tool that can not only trim away your close facial hairs, but also 
vacuum suck them up
. This dual function means this vacuum beard trimmer is relatively unique on the market and is certainly worth a look.


If you have facial hair that’s stubbly and tends to stick to your skin or  the bathroom countertop, this trimmer’s vacuum feature makes it a perfect choice. In addition, it comes with 11 length settings and a rechargeable, 
longer-lasting lithium-ion battery
.  


Features


As mentioned, this trimmer comes with an adjustable length guide comb. You can lock this up to 11 different length settings between 2 and 18 mm. The trimmer blade itself is made of stainless steel and is easy to wash. The 
blade is exceptionally sharp
 and, thanks to the stainless steel material, isn’t vulnerable to corrosive damage. 


When you power on the trimmer, a 
small vacuum system works simultaneously
. This creates a little suction effect, sucking up your facial hair debris as you cut away your hair strands. The result? No more dark dustings on your bathroom countertop.


The vacuumed away hair goes into a collection chamber that you can remove from the trimmer and dump into your waste bin at your discretion.


 
 
Pros
 




 Stainless steel blades included, plus they’re self-sharpening so they should last longer


 Trimmer is a 
fully washable device
, so wet shaving is possible


 Only takes 7-8 hours to fully charge and provides 90 minutes of battery




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Doesn’t provide a very close shave on average


 Bulky




 
 
 


Overall, it’s a solid electric trimmer that offers a lot of value to 
men with close beards
. While it’s not ideal for a perfectly clean shave, it brings a lot to like with the adjustability of its main guide comb and the vacuum function.


This rechargeable beard trimmer and hair trimmer is an ideal pick if you’re less concerned about a perfectly clean shave (say, if you normally keep a little stubble anyway, or even use a stubble comb) but want to avoid having lots of trimming debris on your bathroom countertop.


5. 
Braun Electric Razor for Men
 – Best Advanced Beard Trimmer
















$79.94




View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








The Braun Electric Razor is yet another high-quality beard trimmer. As an 
electric foil shaver
, it uses a stainless steel foil blade system: hairs on your face are trapped in foil slots, bringing them up close to trimming blades for a close shave without irritating your skin. This design makes it one of the best electric shavers for sensitive skin.


This particular shaver is rechargeable and easy to clean and has 
three spinning blades
 for maximum cutting potential. A lithium-ion battery and 100% waterproofing make it a versatile and effective trimming tool for a variety of beard styles.


Features


The beard trimmer comes with an attachment for styles with hair length between 0.5 mm to 7 mm. As such, while it doesn’t cut quite close enough for a full clean shave, it is ideal for men with beards of practically any other short length.


It comes with a 
removable main head
 so you can clean the foil blades quickly and easily. You also get a protective cap for the head to prevent dirt or debris from falling in over time, plus a smart plug for recharging the battery.


 
 
Pros
 




 Has a lithium-ion battery for 50 minutes of shaving time per charge


 Has quick charge capability – change it in five minutes if you forget to plug it in


 Comes with an 
LED battery and charging indicator


 100% waterproof for wet shaving


 Comes with maneuverable head for easy contour shaving




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Doesn’t come with additional guard combs, so adjusting trim length is difficult


 Pricey




 
 
 


All in all, the Braun 5020s Shaver is a top trimmer for men that includes some great trimming potential thanks to the included attachment. It’s a wonderful cordless tool thanks to its waterproof functionality, comfortable handle, and excellent lithium-ion battery. 


I’d recommend this for guys who aren’t concerned about getting super close shaves but who want to take care of their stubble and short beard hair quickly and easily. It’s also a good choice if you tend to forget to plug your shaver in when it’s low on battery life.


6. 
Micro Touch SOLO Men’s Rechargeable Full Body Hair Trimmer
 – Best Beard Trimmer For Keeping Body Hair In Check
















$43.33




View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








The Micro Touch SOLO is a 
full body 
hair trimmer
 that can work for anywhere you might want to boost with a nice trim. It performs this versatile work thanks to three trimming attachments and a pivoting head that can contour to practically any body shape.


It’s also a cordless and fully rechargeable shaving tool. You can use this outside the shower and benefit from 
German stainless steel blades
 that will allow you to shave away most body hair without skin irritation.


Features


The Micro Touch SOLO comes with three trimming combs designed to cut a length of 1 mm, 3 mm, and 5 mm. Regardless of the comb you use, you’ll benefit from German stainless steel blades. These are dual-sided to afford you maximum trimmer maneuverability. 


The shaver also comes with 
a built-in LED light
 to give you a little extra visibility for some of your body’s darker nooks.


You also get 
a single USB recharging cable
 with the purchase. This does mean you’ll need a USB/outlet adapter if you want to recharge it with a conventional plug, instead of with your laptop or desktop. For business travelers, the USB recharging option is a great feature, though.


 
 
Pros
 




 Has a pivoting head to let you shave practically everywhere


 Comes with three guard combs for different trimming lengths


 Comes with stainless steel blades for added shave quality




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Small size limits its power – thicker hair is tougher to shave and shave results aren’t particularly smooth compared to straight razors


 Can break easily




 
 
 


I think this trimmer is one of the 
best electric shavers
 for men, particularly those who want a single trimmer that can get the job done everywhere – assuming you properly clean and sanitize it, of course! Its ease of use, small size, and easy rechargeability make it an ideal travel trimmer as well, especially since you recharge the device using a USB cable.


I’d definitely recommend this for men who are frequently on the road and who don’t want to take multiple trimmers with them in their bags. It’s also a good choice if you want to experiment with somebody trimming or “manscaping.”

Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer Series 3500
 – 
Best Premium Beard Trimmer

Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








The Norelco 3500 is one of the best beard and mustache trimmers you can find. Specifically, it comes with self-sharpening blades made of 
titanium
 rather than stainless steel, plus 20 built-in lengths to let you decide how long your beard hair ends up being.


It also comes with one of the best lithium-ion batteries on the market for these types of devices. A beard comb to 
prevent skin irritation and automatic voltage protection
 round out its offerings to create a composite, well-rounded tool.


Features


The blades for this beard and mustache trimmer, as mentioned, are made 
of self-sharpening titanium
. This is excellent since it means the blades will last for a long time, should stay sharp for between five and six months on average, and won’t irritate your skin. The trimmer even features rounded blade tips to increase these effects. 


Additionally, the trimmer comes with an adjustable wheel that allows you to swap between 20 different precision settings. Go as low as 0.5 mm up to 10 mm in trim length. It’s an ideal tool for super close shaves or for trimming a beard without getting rid of everything entirely.


The blades are fairly easy to wash, and the trimmer comes with a phenomenal ergonomic handle.


 
 
Pros
 




 Blades are skin-friendly (i.e. hypoallergenic) and made of titanium for added sharpness/durability


 You get great battery life at 120 minutes


 Very lightweight at 10.4 ounces and is easy to hold


 Easy to clean the trimmer since the head detaches




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Doesn’t contour with your jaw, making trimming the corners a bit tricky


 Pricier than average




 
 
 


It’s arguably the 
best expensive beard trimmer
 you can find. The phenomenal blades, superior cutting customizability, and ideal lithium-ion battery make it a worthy choice for men in the market for the best, not the most affordable.


It’s almost a perfect electric shaver. Definitely consider this if you want to spend a little extra money for arguably the highest quality electric trimmer on the market.

Wahl Stainless Steel Lithium Ion+ Beard and Nose Trimmer for Men
 – Fastest Charging Beard Trimmer
















$74.99




View on Amazon


Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








This stainless steel Wahl beard trimmer uses self-sharpening and precision blades to ensure a precise trim every time you use the tool. It also comes with a 
collection of multipurpose attachments
, which makes it a great all-use tool for men who change their facial hairstyles from time to time.


It’s a great tool for body hair trimming as well, including the hard-to-reach hairs in your nose or ears. Furthermore, it’s a perfect travel trimming tool since it can run with dual voltage functionality.


Features


This trimmer is a sleek and stylish tool that has a 
surface of brushed stainless steel
. This improves durability overall. You’ll also find four distinct trimming heads, each of which is suitable for a different type of trimming. For instance, one is great for your beard, the other is best for your nose, and so on.


Even better, the trimmer comes with 
12 attachment guards
. This allows you to set your trimming length between 1/16 of an inch up to 1 inch. Thus, it’s a perfect tool for trimming your regular hair in addition to your facial hair. 


The power plug is suitable for both domestic and international outlets as well, or 110 V and 220 V. The blades are self-sharpening and made of stainless steel for added durability and long-lasting cutting performance.


 
 
Pros
 




 Works for any type of facial or body hair since it comes with different heads and guard combs


 Stainless steel handle will keep the trimmer from suffering water damage


 Has a lithium-ion battery indicator


 You get four hours of battery after one hour of charging




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Not a very maneuverable trimmer, so it’s hard to trim the jaw


 No wet shaving




 
 
 


I think this is a great beard and nose hair trimmer through and through, but its real value comes in its versatility for other hair across your body. Spend a little extra money, I say, and get a single trimming tool that can do it all instead of having to spend money on a separate grooming tool for a holistic trimming routine.


I think this is a perfect choice for men who travel frequently 
and
 for men that have a lot of body hair in addition to facial hair. Since you can trim it all with this tool, you’ll find managing your body, head, and facial hair to be much easier after the purchase.

Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








This trimmer comes with several additional attachments and accessories to make it one of the best beard clippers around. The trimmer blades (of which there are four) are great for shaving your head, face, and body. It’s one of the 
best beard trimmers for precision detailing
 since there’s a specific head to help you trim your eyebrow hairs!


Regardless, each of the heads make use of 
excellent stainless steel blades
. Additional guard combs allow you to 
personalize your trimming experience
. Furthermore, I found that this trimmer is one of the more powerful models you can find online, so it may be perfect for men with particularly coarse or rough hair.


Features


This beard, ear and nose trimmer has plenty of features to make it worth your while. First and foremost are the seven individual guard adjustable combs, which allow you to set your trimming length between 1/8 of an inch to 3/8 of an inch. Some of the combs are also designed for specific things: for instance, there’s a dedicated “stubble guide” comb.


There are also four cutting heads: one for trimming, one for shaving body hair and facial hair, a precision detail for nose, ear and eyebrow hair (making it an excellent ear trimmer), and a regular trimmer head. Each of these uses 
self-sharpening blades 
that should stay excellent over the long-term.


You also get a carrying case, a regular comb, beard cleaning supplies, and a power cable with your purchase. All in all, there’s a ton of value included with this 
men’s grooming kit
.


 
 
Pros
 




 Lots of value in the kit due to the included accessories


 Soft touch grip is rubberized and ergonomic, which makes it hard to drop even when your grip is slippery


 Plenty of battery (three hours) with a single charge


 Blades are self-sharpening and there are lots of length attachments




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Shaved hair can get into the blade mechanism from time to time, decreasing performance


 Can rust




 
 
 


I’d overall rate this trimmer quite highly and think it’s one of the best men’s beard trimmers and
 
grooming kits. The fact that you can trim just about any type of hair on your body using the plethora of combs, heads, and self-sharpening blades make it a great starter kit for men getting their own place for the first time or for guys who just want to get a lot of use from a single tool.


I’d certainly recommend that you consider this trimmer if you want to be able to trim your body, head, ear, and other types of hair with the same tool. It’s also a good pick if you need something that’s great for traveling, especially since you get a carrying case with the purchase.

Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








This Braun trimmer is sharp, fast, and efficient and comes with one of the best precision dials on our list. You get up to 
20 length settings
, lifetime sharp blades, and 
German technology
 that all combine into a single phenomenal trimming product.


Though it’s one of the more affordable electric trimmers on the market, this tool can be used for beard style trimming or hair clipping depending on your needs, thanks to the inclusion of a special guard comb. A contouring head rounds out its excellent value.


Features


For starters, this trimmer comes with a precision dial that allows you to alternate between 20 length settings, from 0.5 mm to 10 mm. Thus, you can use this trimmer for practically any beard length or hairstyle.


Speaking of hairstyle, you’ll be able to combine the 
lifetime sharp blades
 with the haircutting guard comb you can easily slide onto the top of the device. This makes your own haircut trimmer! You also get an additional cleaning brush with your purchase for even more added value.


 
 
Pros
 




 Head is contoured, allowing you to make more accurate lines and trim hard to reach areas


 Good battery life at 50 minutes


 Blades are very sharp and should last for several months


 Trimmer is light and very easy to hold




 
 
 
 
Cons
 




 Can’t use the trimmer in the shower


 Relatively long charge time at 10 hours




 
 
 


I think this is the 
best cheap beard trimmer
 given its versatility and great results. Few other budget-friendly trimmers can work for your hair just as well as they can for your stubble. While you might want to combine this with a traditional razor for a particularly close shave, this is still a great pick for guys who want to cultivate an excellent close beard. 


Check this out and consider buying it if you need something budget-friendly but effective. It’s a great trimmer that doesn’t cut corners despite being so affordable.


Buyer’s Guide: Things to Consider Before Purchasing a Beard Trimmer


Corded or Cordless


Electric facial hair trimmers come in corded or cordless models. 
Corded trimmers
 have the advantage of 
never running out of power
, provided you have a power outlet close at hand whenever you want to use them.


However, 
cordless trimmers
 are often seen as superior. This is because cordless trimmers can be taken with you into the shower more often than not, allowing you to benefit from a nice 
wet shave
. Furthermore, they’re 
great travel trimming tools
 since you don’t need to worry about taking a bulky power cord along with you.


Still, cordless trimmers are only really worth your time if you can remember to recharge them when their batteries get low on power. Some of the best hair and beard trimmers come with battery life indicators to alert you to this condition before the battery life becomes critical.


Adjustability/Lengths


Many of the best beard trimmers for men will be adjustable to some extent. They may have an adjustable dial that allows you to alter the height the trimming blades extend to from the device’s neck. These lengths are great for determining whether you want to give yourself a 
relatively close shave
 or just 
trim away some length
 from a close beard.


Alternatively, some of the best adjustable beard trimmers come with 
guard combs
. These can be attached to the tops of trimmers and will prevent the cutting blades from getting close to your hair by a preset length. You can 
maintain a beard of optimal length
 in this way, so be sure to choose a trimmer featuring at least a few guard combs if you aren’t interested in shaving down to stubble or a clean-shaven look.


Battery Life


As mentioned, 
battery life
 for cordless trimmers is pretty important. That’s because nothing is worse than needing to give yourself a quick shave, only for your cordless trimmer to no longer have enough battery life or power.


Some of the best beard trimmers come with tools that will 
continue to work even at low power
. Others, however, are limited in that they don’t let you give yourself a quick trim if they need to be charged and have only a few minutes of juice left.


You should also consider 
how long it takes for a cordless trimmer to recharge
 from empty. Some trimmers, for example, can give you up to 
5 hours of battery life
 for 
around 10 hours of charge time
. Other trimmers’ charge/run time ratios aren’t nearly so generous and may require more than 10 hours of charge for only a single hour of power.


Accessories


Lots of electric beard trimmers will also come with some accessories, including guard combs. However, other trimmers will come with full-on beard trimmer kits that might include:


additional trimming heads
 – these are ideal for trimming nose hair, ear hair, and eyebrow hair
carrying bags
, which are great if you need the trimmer for traveling
plugs and cords
charging stations
 if they are a particular cordless model


Keep the accessories included in a kit in mind as this element can help you determine which trimmer is really right for you if two similar models are close in price and features otherwise. 


Can It Clip Hair?


Some of the best men’s hair clippers are also hair trimmers!


But what are the real differences between 
beard trimmers vs. hair clippers
? Hair clippers are basically the same thing but have longer cutting lengths and rougher blades in many cases.


One of the best hair clippers you can get doubles as a beard trimmer: the 
Braun Beard Trimmer for Men BT3221
. Since it’s wireless, this rechargeable hair clipper is an ideal whole-trimming tool for travel.


Does it work in Water?


Lastly, be sure to consider whether a given trimmer 
works in water
. Remember that only cordless trimmers can work in water at all. Being able to 
give yourself a wet shave
 is usually considered to be a better experience and enables you to trim closer to your skin since your pores are more opened and your hair is softer.


Methodology


To choose the best beard trimmers, I tried to answer some of the big questions I faced when trimming my own facial hair. For instance:


Is the trimmer good for shaping?
Does it also cut hair?
How often can I use it?


Doing this allowed me to remove plenty of trimmers right off the bat. For instance, I got rid of a bunch of extra Philips trimmers since too many of them had battery lifes not worth writing home about.


After eliminating the junk trimmers, I focused on the features included with each trimmer tool. After all, they’re each designed to cut facial hair. To determine the best ones, I prioritized testing the different individual features, accessories, or customization elements each included.


Instead of cutting my own facial hair all the time (that would take too long), I enlisted the help of guys from our editorial department. Each tested one and compared the results. So I had some real-world experience for each trimmer even though I only have one face of (now gone) facial hair!


Final Verdict


So, when all is said and done, 
which electric razor is the best
 out of all these?


Ultimately, it depends on you and your personal needs! But if you have 
facial hair of any style or length
, at least one of these trimmers ought to have caught your eye. For instance, who could resist the shine of the 
Wahl Stainless Steel Lithium Ion+ Beard and Nose Trimmer for Men
?


For my part, I really liked the 
Philips Norelco OneBlade Hybrid Electric Trimmer
 for its ease of use and versatility. No matter what your preferences are, remember what I went over in the buying guide and you’ll choose the perfect trimmer for your facial hair.


FAQ


Q: What is the best beard trimmer?


A: Ultimately, I think the 
Philips Norelco OneBlade Hybrid Electric Trimmer
 is the best beard trimmer for men since it’s affordable, versatile, and features blades that can last for up to four months. It’s also pretty good in terms of price, so men with most budget levels should be able to give it a whirl.


Q: Which brand is best for trimmers?


A: The best beard trimmer brands consistently put out quality products. Philips, Panasonic, and Braun are my go-to’s, especially when you consider the beard trimmer reviews for most of their devices. Wahl products are also usually decent, though only a few of their trimmers match the consistent high ratings of the other three brands. Remington, as well, can be a good choice, with many budget-friendly options that deliver good quality.


Q: How do I trim my beard perfectly?


A: Trimming a beard to perfection is an exercise in trial and error. Try to use a guard comb or set your trimmer to a particular length and give yourself a trim. 


Go cautiously at first to ensure you don’t cut your facial hair too short. You can always trim more hair later!


What if you decided to trim your facial hair extremely short, but now want to make a change? Wait for your hair to grow out again and set the trimmer or guard comb to a longer length. The reverse is true if you want your hair to be even shorter.


Honestly, each man has a different ideal beard length based on his hair type and personal aesthetic. You’ll have to experiment if you want to find the perfect length for your face.


Don’t forget to spend some time cleaning your trimmer’s blade! It’s the only way to make sure it lasts for a long time.


Q: What is the best 
cordless beard trimmer
?


A: The 
Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer Series 3500
 is arguably the best cordless beard trimmer on the market purely in terms of features and functionality. It’s pricy though, so it’s really only a good choice for men with a little extra cash to spend.


Q: What is better – cordless or corded beard trimmer?


A: In my opinion, a wireless beard trimmer is the way to go. It’s simply too valuable to be able to trim your beard or body hair in the shower to give up that aspect just to ensure you always have power. So long as you remember to plug in a corded trimmer after every time you use it so it can constantly recharge, you’ll be set.


Q: Which beard trimmer gives the closest shave?


A: The 
Wahl Professional 5-Star Detail Trimmer with Adjustable T Blade
 gives quite a close shave, even though it’s corded. The 
Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer Series 3500
, too, is capable of shaving almost close enough to compete with straight razors.


Q: What beard trimmers do barbers use?
A: Professionals at barbershops often use professional-grade trimmers that include high-quality power cords, a plethora of different length settings and guard combs, and comfortable handles. A great example is the 
Wahl Professional 5-Star Detailer with Adjustable T Blade
, which is essentially one of the best beard trimmers for barbers that’s now on the market for regular guys.

Our first electric shaver in this series comes all the way from German Tech Industry known as Braun. The Braun series 7 is no doubt the most popular series ever built by this company and the model 790cc is the most sold electric shaver of all time. Undoubtedly, it is still the best electric shaver out there and number 1 in our list. Enough Praise, let’s get into the business now.


The shaver provides amazingly close and smooth shave as compared to others in our lineup. Series 7 790cc is quite different regarding features from other electric shavers. The face of this electric shaver has three trimmers. Two of them are called “OptiFoil” while the one within the other two, is called “ActiveLift.”


The OptiFoil trimmers help the electric shaver to cover more facial hairs in fewer strokes while the ActiveLift contributes to cut out the short and in-grown hairs. Not to forget that this is a Pulsonic electric shaver, which produces 10,000 micro vibrations per minute, which helps the shaver to capture more and more hairs in each stroke.


The head of Braun 790cc is very flexible and can quickly move around the contours of your face. The shaver comes with an alcohol based Cleaning and Charging Dock., which can kill the 99% of the germs with the help of a single button. Other than that, there are 3 personalization modes available in this advanced electric shaver known as Normal, Intensive, and Extra Sensitive. You can choose the way according to your skin type and hairs. There is also a pop-up trimmer for trimming beards, mustache, and sideburns.


The only downside in this electric shaver is that it is missing 
Wet&Dry Technology
. However, this feature is available in the other variant of Braun Series 7, known as 
Braun 799cc
 which is quite expensive.


Overall, the Braun series 7 790cc is my all time favorite and 
best electric shaver 2022 
out there in the market. The built quality is great, 3 trimmers, pivoting head, personalization modes and cleaning dock are enough for comfortable and close shave. Other than that, this is one of the most budget electric shaver available in the market. The price is very low as compared to others in our lineup.


Pros & Cons

The next one in our list is also from the Braun. It is the latest electric shaver series launched by Braun and our favorite model in this list is Braun 9095CC.


The electric shaver is covered up with all of the shiny chrome plastic, which looks cool!


This electric shaver works in the same way as the above 790cc, the only difference is that 9095cc contains one extra trimmer known as “Direct & Cut”. This additional trimmer helps the shaver to align the hairs which grow in different directions and then cut those out. Other than that, the ActiveLift trimmer from 790cc is replaced by HyperLift Trimmer which is a bit more advanced and helps to remove the flat hairs.


Braun 9095 Pulsonic shaver produce 40,000 cross-cutting actions per minute, please don’t mix it up with the 10,000 micro vibrations of 790cc. It provides a bit more close shave than 790cc, the difference is not that much to amaze. Pop-up trimmer is also there.


The reason why it is listed as number 2 is because it’s made of plastic while the 799cc contains metal head. Other than that, you are going to pay a lot of money for the features you really don’t require if you have a normal beard and you shave on a daily basis. However, this electric shaver is a bit more comfortable on the skin.


Braun series 9 9095cc has all of the features of 790cc and it also has the Wet&Dry technology, which helps the user to use this electric shaver either on dry skin or with shaving gel for sensitive skin.

When it comes to electric shavers, Panasonic has made a name for itself by providing some of the finest electric shavers available in the market. Albeit some might consider them to be somewhat on the expensive side, they make it up for the price by offering great performance, and value for money. Previously, the ES-LV81 was among our favorite electric shavers available in the market, however, the much better, upgraded model called the ES-LV95 has dethroned it.


The ES-LV95 by Panasonic is made for people who prefer an extremely clean, and close shave. I know many claim that the manually done shaving is much better, but this electric shaver is here to change the game. Upon shaving, I figured out that the shaving came out very natural, and extremely close, making up for a skin that was smooth to the touch, and even all around. Not to mention, shaving with this shaver is super-fast, resulting in a lot of time saved.


The LV95 also comes with a built-in screen that might seem like a gimmick to some, but it is actually a very useful addition; not only it displays an accurate representation of the battery that is left, but it also tells you how long you have been shaving when you turn off the shaver.


Considering how this is Panasonic’s flagship electric shaver, it does come with a cleaning station for those who love them. The cleaning station is used to remove all the hair after you have shaved and clean the blades at the push of a button, it is super simple, and super easy as well. However, for those who are not looking to put the shaver back in the cleaning station, a protective cover is also provided, and in addition to that, you also get a leather traveling pouch.


With all the good things aside, I do have a few minor gripes with the otherwise excellent Panasonic ES-LV95. For starters, the shaver can be loud at times, and the perfect way to explain this would be to compare the sound with the same sound that is made by a swarm of bees.


In addition to that, for people who have sensitive skin, the shaver might be a bit too harsh in the beginning. However, do not worry, because the skin will adjust to the shaver on multiple uses, and it will not be an issue.


Overall, the Panasonic ES-LV95 is a wonderful electric shaver that does come with a price, but offers many amenities that end up making up for the price. It has no major, deal breaking flaws, making it one of the best electric shavers in the market.


Pros & Cons


Pros




 Shaving with ES-LV95 is simple, easy, and fast.


 The display is excellent and gives all the needed information.


 The cleaning station is a great addition.






Cons




 Sensitive skin might feel the harshness in the beginning.


 The operational noise can be a nuisance in the beginning.

Now let’s come to the downsides of this shaver. The shaver feels premium from looks but when you get your hands on it, it feels really cheap. Shame it is all plastic and rubber. The battery is fixed, so if somehow your battery goes out of the order, you will have no choice but to replace your electric shaver.

 – Best Electric Shaver for Ease of Access

Last update on 2023-05-23 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








Braun has constantly provided the consumers with some of the best electric shavers that are not only amazing, but also affordable for the most part. Continuing the tradition, we are looking at the Braun Series 3 ProSkin 3040s, an affordable electric shaver that aims to deliver a great shaving experience, all while keeping the consumers at peace that they are not going to spend a lot of money.


The one thing that most people want from a good electric shaver is obviously the ease of access. This is because many of the higher end shavers give consumers steep learning curve because of too many features that are at times unnecessary for them. However, things are different with the ProSkin 3040s; this electric shaver is among the best when it comes to the ease of access, by being one of easiest electric shavers, so much so that you will not be afraid of messing things up.


The electric shaver also comes with a built-in display, something that is slowly becoming common in the majority of electric shavers in the market. The display can show you the remaining battery life, while the displayed life might not be as accurate, it is still convenient, because it does allow you to put your shaver on charge whenever you feel like.


As far as the overall shaving experience is concerned, the Braun Series 3 ProSkin 3040s provides a great shaving experience keeping the price in concern. Sure, it might not be as close to some of the flagship electric shavers available in the market, but keeping the ease of access, and price in mind, I could not ask the electric shaver for a performance that is better than what the shaver already offers.


Last but not the least; the shaver does not require the user to wet their face before using, as you can simply use it even with a wet face. Although, it might not matter to many people, but it makes thing fast, especially for people who want to get out of bed, shave, and leave for work.


The one thing that I did not like about the Braun Series 3 ProSkin 3040s shaver is that despite offering close shave, there are situations in which the shaver leaves much of the stubble for behind. It would have been okay in case of a trimmer, but we are talking about a full-fledged electric shaver here. Lastly, a subjective part, but potential buyers should know that the shaver does take some time getting charged, so it is best if you charge it overnight, or at times when you are not in need of it.


Rest assured the Braun Series 3 ProSkin 3040s is an excellent electric shaver that is affordable, and will get the job done for the most part. It might not be best electric shaver of all time, but it is much better than many other options available in the market.


Pros & Cons


Pros




 Excellent value for money


 Affordable


 Offers a good shave


 The shaver is easy to use


 Does not require the user to wet their face






Cons




 The shave leaves stubble behind


 The shaver takes

Last update on 2023-05-22 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API








The number 9th is going to be from the famous Remington. Remington is a famous brand which designed lots of entry level to mid range electric shavers. They were first to introduce cordless recharging system for electric shavers.


F5-5800 contains 2 foils and 1 trimmer in the head. The head can pivot upward and downward and it moves around the contours of your face to provide you easy and comfortable shave.


The shaver is very easy to clean. Simply remove the head of the shaver and rinse it under water. The shaver is irritation free. Trust me, I had a lot of irritation even with most of the high-end shavers listed above, including Braun 790cc but Remington F5-5800 was complete irritation free electric shaver.


The shaver is made up of all cheap plastic. It doesn’t provide close shaving, for closeness in the budget I recommend you to go with 
Panasonic Arc 3
. The blades required replacement after average use of 3-4 months, which costs additionally. The shavers make a lot of noise because of the motor.


Remington F5-5800 is an affordable and an entry-level shaver which provides smooth and comfortable shave. There are few drawbacks which I mentioned above, however, you can buy it under $50. So, those negative points can be ignored.

Electric Shaver Buyer’s Guide


Advanced electric shavers are the combination of technology which comes in a small package. Before choosing your electric shaver either from the list above or somewhere else, I recommend you to still read our Buyer’s Guide, it will help you to understand the technology that goes with in these modern electric shavers.


So without further ado, let’s continue with our electric shaver buying guide.


Rotary vs Foil
 – Which is best for you?


I prefer Foil shavers over Rotary shavers because of the closeness, smoothness, and design.


Rotary shavers were introduced first to provide comfortable shaving experience and shaving head. No doubt that rotary shavers are much more comfortable as compared to the foil shavers but they failed to provide a close shave.


Whereas on the other hand, foil shavers are expert in closeness. They contain sharp blades and advanced technology which I really like.




LED Indicator:
 A charger with a LED indicator is good enough to keep you updated with the current battery level. Notify you when you plugged in the charger and warn you with the low battery.


Corded and Cordless Shaving:
 Few of the electric shavers allow you to shave while your electric shaver plugged in while few don’t. Braun series 9 doesn’t allow corded shaved while Braun series 7 do allow it.


Easy to use and clean:
 Make sure the electric shavers design is easy to use and clean. Almost all of electric shavers listed above are easy to use and easy to clean. Most of the electric shavers above come with Cleaning dock, all you have to do is to put the shaver inside that dock and press the button, that dock will clean your shaver. Some models don’t come with that cleaning dock, so you have to do it manually. But that won’t take more than 1 minute!


Pop-up Trimmer:
 Most of the shavers come with an integrated trimmer which can be popped up. You can use that trimmer for grooming, sideburns, and mustache.


Wet & Dry Technology:
 Wet&Dry technology allows electric shavers to be used either under the shower or on dry skin. If you got a sensitive skin, then you might prefer shaving with gel foam. That’s where this technology comes handy.

What the fi?


If you don’t know what I am talking about, you are probably not an audiophile.

FAQ


What is lo-fi music?


Lo fi music
 
music is actually the opposite of high-quality and high fidelity music (or just hi-fi), which is the type of production that is behind most of your favorite popular songs and music productions nowadays.


What does lo-fi stand for?


Lo fi, meaning low fidelity music, describes the degree of exactness when something is copied or reproduced. Usually, when we speak about music, low fidelity would mean bad quality, slow, repetitive tracks, sometimes with an audible hiss.


But not bad as in bad, but rather the good type of bad. 


That is music specifically designed to have repetitiveness arranged to produce a unique track. 


Where did lo-fi music come from?


Lo-fi music songs are often produced with sample selections by drum loop, or even with classic music variations. 


And did you know that – 


We can define lo-fi as chill study music – calming music tracks are actually a variety of lo fi music.


So next time when your friend has a lot of things on their mind, tell them to play some lofi chill beats and relax.


What genre is lo-fi?


Lo-fi can also be defined as a background element with an analog warmth, in which the genre is not designed to be the primary focus, but rather something to contribute to a certain action. This is similar to chamber pop, where the emphasis is on the audio, rather than the vocals.


How does lo-fi sound?


Lo-fi music is related to both R&B and jazz, since most lo-fi compositions have guitar, piano, bass, drums, and often trumpet samples. 


If you are wondering about the lo-fi pronunciation, it’s pronounced “low-fai”, since it comes from low fidelity.




Let’s try to find out what makes the chill lo fi beats so good for relaxing or concentrating.


Imagine the sounds of ocean waves or a pouring river. Envision the wind hitting the leaves of a large forest or even the sounds of the endless void of space.  


Now imagine all of this combined with soothing jazz, R&B, and a little bit of a drum on the side.


I don’t know about you, but I already feel relaxed. 


The history of lo-fi music


Even though lo-fi music became quite popular only during the last few years, its origins date back to as early as 1950. 


The people who first started to produce lofi samples were amateurs and bedroom musicians. Due to their inexpensive equipment and home-recording practices, they began to create recordings that contained unnatural sounds or harmonic distortion.


Who created lo-fi hip hop?


Some people began to describe the early lo-fi productions as chillwave or even as DIY music, since the quality of the sound they had was not as high as the songs they would hear on the radio.


Despite this, the wider public came to enjoy these new lofi hip hop beats, since it was outsider music that had never been heard before at the time.  


However, not everybody was a fan.


AllMusic
, which is an American online music database that catalogs more than 3 million album entities and 30 million records, claimed that lo-fi is – 


“Cheaply and quickly produced music, often on substandard equipment.”


However, the success of one lo-fi track speaks for not only itself, but the whole genre. More specifically, the track “
My Song
” by the artist Johnny Ace. 


Every music admirer knows how big of a deal the Billboard charts are, and “My Song” managed to reach the number one spot on the Billboard R&B chart back in 1952.




“It was a fifteen-minute job” were the words of the co-writer of the song David Mattis. But despite the fact that the song was both written and recorded at a radio station, its success is undeniable. 


According to critics, the song has a feeling of misplayed notes and primitivism due to the fact that it was rushed. However, it’s exactly this feeling that is a sample of modern-day lo fi bands. Often, artists struggle to accomplish this manually, and they turn to artificial methods to achieve it. 


Lo-fi music of today


Today, lo-fi music meaning is primarily used as a background filler for almost any situation – studying, relaxing, working, or just filling the silence.


Depending on the specific lo-fi music artists, the tape saturation can purposely or not be damaged or degraded to create this exact feeling of imperfection. 


Now compare this to popular, mainstream music, which we classify as hi-fi. This type of music is expertly mixed and mastered to create professional sound reflections.


On the other hand, lo-fi is intended to sound the opposite – raw. 


Today’s lofi songs tend to derive inspiration from 1990s popular hip-hop and R&B records and turn them around to create something unique. 


Loops, lofi piano samples or lo fi jazz samples are all parts of the genre.


However, sampling another track is not something new in the music industry. Even in today’s popular and R&B music, you can hear tons of artists sampling famous songs from previous years and decades.




Many different artists such as The Black Eyed Peas, Nicki Minaj, Katy Perry and many more have hits that are sampled from successful old songs.


Although this may sound like stealing, it is actually different than that. It is similar to hauntology, which refers to returning elements from the past. The rights of a song are of course bought, so legally the sample can be recorded or duplicated.


But not only.


Some of the best lofi songs today are cut, rearranged or extended to create something different, yet familiar. 


This is done for a couple of reasons.


The first one being the intent for the song to sound fresh, with a retro, vintage or disco vibe, which is all the rage nowadays.


But mainly, sampling a popular old song is done to create the feeling of nostalgia. 


Lo-fi tracks are no exception.




Nostalgia is the sentimental and yearning desire to return in thought to a former time or place in one’s life that is associated with joy and happiness.


Lo-fi, similar to hypnagogic pop, gives us this nostalgic feeling not only for things that have passed, but also for the things that have yet to come.


When listening to most genres of music, people tend to remember a certain lyric or a specific vocal that may get stuck in their head.


But when it comes to lo-fi, this is different.


What remains in your head after listening to lo-fi is not a memory of a lyric, but rather a lasting emotion, feeling or state of mind.


However, the genre is not made up of just lo fi hip hop beats to study and relax to. There are plenty of genre combinations along with the chill degraded audio signals of lo-fi.


Parts of it, like lofi rap, lofi pop or lofi live concerts, may not be as popular as lofi jazz and lofi remixes for concentration, but they are still part of the artform.


So, how to make lo fi music, and what instruments to make a lo fi album you would need?


Lo-fi is more than just bedroom pop, so you will definitely need audio engineering skill, or at least to some degree.


Downloading some digital audio workstations will be the first step of starting your journey. If you are technically primitive (like me) do your research first before getting your hands on those unfavourable signal-to-noise ratio notes.


Consider checking your room acoustics and think about what kind of out of tune or out of time notes you want to produce.


The aesthetic of lo-fi music


Lo-fi music is a musical journey.


In lo-fi tracks, there are tons of references to jazz and solo artists, but with phonographic imperfections.


And not only from a single place. 


Lo-fi music samples explore different continents, countries and cultures. The influence for the lo-fi aesthetic is taken from a global perspective and viewpoint that makes people feel like they are listening to a jazz or hip hop instrumental, but from an old vinyl player. 


Most of today’s lo-fi music draws inspiration from Japanese culture. 


And not only the sound. In a lofi youtube search, you can find that the visuals that accompany the track follow a deliberate aesthetic choice based on Japanese culture. Whether they are styled as gifs, video, lo fi pictures, or even as lofi games, the visuals tend to follow the same pattern.  


And all of this is not without reason.


The visuals accompanying the track are meant to extend and contribute to the feeling that the sounds bring, whether it is going to be upbeat or sad lofi songs.


But where does it come from?


We already mentioned that the first lo-fi recordings date back to as early as the 1950s, when neither anime nor “youtube lifi” were a thing, at least not for the general US public. Sure, there were cartoons and comics, but not anime in the sense of the specific Japanese cultural aesthetic that modern lo-fi visuals follow, or just anime lofi.


It’s not only for the aesthetics. 


Japanese jazz and lo fi beat maker artists are some of the main contributors to and founders of the entire genre. 


One of the most prominent ones is Nujabes, and if you are a lo-fi admirer you already know why. His jazzy productions and unique use of samples shaped the genre. His work consists of some of the best lo fi hip hop songs out there.


His own influence is drawn from numerous classic and solo jazz artists, combining this with the golden-age tracks of Hip-Hop. 




His three studio albums – Metaphorical Music, Modal Soul and Spiritual State – are a staple of the genre, and define Nujabes as being one of the best lo fi artists. It’s quite hard to find a track that is not influenced by or that does not reference his work.


What ties all of this together is what lo-fi is marketed as.  


That is, music meant for sleeping, working or relaxing, combined with visuals that are a distraction that helps you concentrate. 


Why should you listen to lo-fi music?


And the Grammy goes to…lofi playlist Hip-Hop Anime Chillhop Beats to Study and Relax to.


But really.


Even though people make fun (
and memes
) out of others’ addiction to lo-fi, it’s worth it to give these lofi beats to study to a try. 


And also, why not give it a Grammy as well?


It’s like having your own lofi hip hop background theme in your everyday life. Whether it’s going to be boss fight music or a laid-back track, it’s your own personal music video.


It stirs a certain feeling and it sparks different emotions, and music is meant for that. Sure – it  may be branded as “music for work”, or as some people call it, “modern day elevator music”, but it is much more.


It creates a certain mood that some tracks with vocals do not. Even though it is repetitive, it doesn’t get annoying, since it’s just a lo fi background. 


Lo-fi is passive. 


It does not reach out or try to be any more than that. You can just enjoy it as a secondary presence, rather than a full-on concert you may want to perform when listening to a Lady Gaga song. 


It’s a loop, and a contribution to you living in this exact moment. 


And this is what makes it relatable. 


For the ordinary person, it’s hard to relate to the glamour and posh lifestyle that are often described in pop and hip-hop music. Million dollar mansions, diamonds, fast cars.. It’s not something everybody can relate to, right? 


Now let’s take a look at some chill lofi beats, running-river sounds, and laid-back piano instrumentals. They are much more familiar, relatable, and close to the casual listener. This creates environmental interference that almost everybody can relate to.


Lo-fi is something to help you live in the moment and get through your day. It is something to accompany you in the situations you experience every day. 


And chances are – you have been listening to lo-fi music, without even realizing it. 


For example, some of the calming music tracks you can hear in 
Taylor Swift’s new album – Folklore
, are actually classified as Lo-Fi with a mix of piano tunes. 


What service is best for lo-fi music?


Good old Youtube. 


A simple question – a simple answer.


With a simple search, you can find tons of good lo fi music youtube channels, lofi hip hop radio, and plain lo fi radio channels. And if you do that, you can be sure that you will stumble upon the lofi hip hop girl, a notoriously famous lofi anime character.


And if you are a fan of the tape hiss of cassette culture – treat yourself to some of Nujabes’ albums.


Where is the lo-fi hip hop girl from?


She is actually from the 
Youtube channel @ChilledCow
, and she is a famous lo fi art character that many cover art images in the genre use.


She is associated with studying and relaxing, so you may not find her in lo fi hip hop youtube channel, but rather in those meant for chill.


In conclusion


Try a lofi and chill session.


If you are the type of person that hates the static “noise” of silence, or if you need something to accompany you through your everyday life, why hesitate? If you hate to work or study in silence, go ahead and try some lofi study beats.


I am sure you will like it.


On the other hand, there is a chance you may find it annoying – actually the opposite of what it is meant to be. Some people prefer to work and study in complete silence, and that is okay. In that case, lo-fi is not your cup of tea, and “chill beats to study to” will not be in your Youtube search history.


But if you feel like living in your own music video, then lo-fi could be the right musical complement for you.
