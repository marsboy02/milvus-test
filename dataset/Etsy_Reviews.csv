Hello. A very good product for smoothening the face and apply a small amount during the nighttime if you have oily skin preferably having a silk satin pillow case. Everything arrived on time having extra free gifts such as Glycolic acid body wash and/or Kojic soap upon your request after messaging FrDulcinea. The best for smooth bottom of feet without having to use lotion all day use. She is very considerate and email her enough information on how you want your package and free gifts before sending via international mail.,5
"Hello. I was able to use the Gamme Metisse and achieve a very softened skin texture because of retinol and fruit acids, very strong effective formula in combination with FrDulcinea's Gamme Metisse products. The best for smooth looking skin and NONE BETTER having a beautiful lavender and pumpkin spice fragrance. Shipping on time but ask FrDulcinea concerning bubble wrap. The best for smooth looking skin and NONE BETTER. She is very kind and make sure to message or email her enough information during your ordering period  before sending your package.",5

"Not received, but delivered in Mailbox Post ... What !!! the saleswoman had planned re shipping, commercial gesture. But given his many travels, she could honor ... I expect nothing more. Money in the trash !!! 63,50 euros for 2 items. Not honest.",1
"1 sent to the top and there ... the color of the cream, the texture is completely different. Small white spots appeared, but tasks fall while I thought party. Not a solution for me.",1
"Not a fan of the smell, different from the first shipment.",2
I like it very much a free sample also she is the best,5

Product was not effective on my skin.,2

Send fast but I expected more results,3
Shipping was on time. Unfortunately I didn’t see any change with my face using this product.  The color was also not as described. It had a mustard color with strong medicine smell.,1
"Delivery time too long, slight effect found only on the face cream at the time of my first order. The body milk and soap are identical to those of the Métis range.
The seller is more or less correct and accepts the return of products and refund (return costs are your responsibility)",1

"received a jar half empty, not even wrapped, no explanation, I know even if c is the right product",1
thank you for products <3 <3 <3,5
I found the product too expensive and small,2
"They sent the wrong shirt, bought in time for Christmas, contacted them to send correct shirt ordered, they said keep the first one and will send correct one, great. later I followed up about shipment status, said they sent it, I asked for tracking, they didn't send it and when asked again they said it was delivered I said that was for the first shirt that I already told you was incorrect, they said oops we're busy but we'll still send, Christmas a couple of days away, I asked again they said they sent it I'm waiting finally they send tracking ie actually ship it after they said they had, received it in January, after Christmas, TX",1
The shirt is very nice but it was to small for me. I guess it run to small. But thank you,5
Good fitting,5
"Fits to size, and is definitely a product I love to wear.",5
"When I originally ordered this shirt on October 20th it said it would arrive BY October 25th. It was a gift for a birthday and I figured okay, it will be there on time.... Everyday I check it the delivery date is one day further back... it is now Oct. 29th and the shirt is still in the place it was ordered from (New York) we live in Arizona. If you’re ordering a last minute gift for someone, expect it to be at least a week after delivery date ‍",1

The worked well on my t shirts.,5
"I really liked this sign. It’s not overly huge like many signs and It has a vintage feel. The added twine made it very easy to quickly hang on my fence without hardware. I really appreciated that. I liked the way it worked on my pool fence so much that I bought a second one for another area of the pool fence. Reminding my children to play safe is very important. Ty, so much!",5
Great product. Bought as a gift and they loved it.,5
Great product. Bought as a gift and they loved it.,5
"This wine stopper is so beautiful and looks exactly how I wanted it too, however, it is really difficult to get in and out of the wine bottle. It is not as functional as it is attractive.",3
"Didn’t have any problems with the estimated shipping date.  But, was disappointed in the finish quality of the Honey Bee sign.  There were scratches in areas that were painted black. Also a few noticeable paint smudges.  I will keep the sign and correct the imperfections I have mentioned. It’s just disappointing to pay for an item that I have to take the time to fix.",1
Excellent customer service and beautiful products!,5
"Awesome sign , came fast I would definitely buy from this shop again",5
I love this placemat.  My cat is a messy eater and this is easier to clean than my floor.,5
They are just the right size for what I am using them for.,4
"While the item did take longer to receive than originally anticipated, the sign is perfect for my sons woodland themed room.",5
"I bought these for my kitchen cabinets, and wow!  The knobs now totally outshine my cabinets.  Just a simple change like adding new and unusual knobs made a HUGE difference.  I live in the mountains, and I have lots of bears that stop by, so these bear knobs are just perfect.  They are well crafted, and very easy to install.  And they make me smile every time I walk into the kitchen.  Love them - they are worth the wait time for delivery!",5
I love it!  Perfect for little girls room!,5
"My in-laws absolutely love this. Great product. Took 3 weeks to ship, but I wasn’t in a rush to get it. Was surprised I got a cute knob for free. Thank you!",5
I purchased this for my Goddaughter's room and I am so happy with it! It is beautiful!,5
"The sign was a gift - my friend really seems to love it.  Would have been 5 stars if it were just the sign alone.  The customer service is less than friendly and shipping time is not accurate - much longer than expected and because it was a gift, the tardiness became an issue.",3
The seller was very helpful and polite before the transaction and the knobs look GREAT!!!  Just got them yesterday and everyone loved them.  Even my cabinet builder was impressed.  Thank you!,5
Absolutely love it. Or was exactly as pictured,5
Too cute!,5
I think I ordered the wrong thing from the wrong vendor.  I thought I was getting a custom mat.  What I got was a custom piece of paper between to laminate sheets that are not completely sealed.  Big disappointment.,2
"So cute! Bought for in laws and everyone comments on how cute it is! Well made and adorable! Arrived quickly, even in the Christmas rush!",5
Very nice rustic sign. Exactly what we were looking for!,5
Sorry didn't realize it was a print on top of wood. I thought it would be stained w painted lettering. Not useable at our Venue. It looks too fake,1
"Bought those signs for a second time, just perfect!",5
"Very nice, but only ""HE IS RISEN"" is easily readable. However it is nice enough that I will purchase again! My purpose in purchasing it was to make it my control joystick tip on my electric wheelchair. Works great !!!!!!!",5
"I bought this for my parents for Christmas for my kids to give to them 
, it's hard to find things with mimi and pop pop on them spelled exactly like that  cause most people have papa or pop on there items and my dad likes it spelled pop pop so I was excited went I found this! It was made very well too !",5
Good looking sign. It arrived well packaged. Thank you.,5
Terrible customer service.  Order placed 2/9 and sign received 2/27.  A free knob and 10 % discount on next order doesn't compensate for this.  I will never order again.,1
Well packed and as described. Thank you.,5
just as described very nice thanks,5
just as described very nice thanks,5

"Beautiful! Just as pictured, and nicely made.",5
This is the 2nd cat mat I've ordered.  Love both of them.  Shipped on time and shop is very easy to work with.,5
I really like these placemats. Having them laminated is a great idea. Thank you!,5
"Communication. I purchased this just shy of a month in advance and yes, I understand things can go wrong but then it should be shipped with different shipping to ensure it is on time. I did contact the seller and I was responded to with an automated general message. Completely unprofessional and disrespectful to their customers.",3
Just as described.  Cute sign.,5
I had two missing knobs on my dresser. These work beautifully. Thank you,5
I purchased this for a friend as a housewarming/Christmas gift.  She loves it!,4
I love the sign it was a little smaller than I expected but overall it was beautiful.,5
My grandparents loved it!!,5

Excellent mat for my black cat's food dish. The laminate is nice and thick and the quality on the image itself is great. Exactly what I was looking for. :),5
"Excellent seller, excellent items, will be doing more purchases in the future.",5
Made this for my aunty and uncle and when they received it I  was told my aunty was so happy she cried.,5
"This sign was perfect for my childs room! He loves science so this sign was a hit! Well made, just as pictured!",5
Sign itself was great. My in laws love it.  Took way too long to ship. Gave me a ship by date and it was incorrect. Wasn’t impressed by that.,4
Didn’t ship when said. The mat is very small. Not worth the money.,2
"I ordered signs on January 6th. I sent an email on January 14th because my items had not shipped yet. I received a response on January 15th it was  a general generated response that didn’t answer my question. I emailed them again on the 21st.  It is January 29th and I still have not received my items. It shows they still have not been shipped. If it was for me I could  be more flexible, but these are gifts that will not be on time. The shipping is unnecessary long.  I should have read the reviews from other customers in reference to shipping. I’m quite frustrated at this point.",1

My 3 year old grandson loves seeing his name on his bedroom door. It is darling and was very fast delivery. I would've given 5 stars except that I wish the wood was just a little more thick with finished edges.,4
Great sale and seller! Matches my set perfectly.,5
"My mom and dad loves their sign we have them as a Christmas gift, wonderful quality and work and fast shipping. Very pleased!",5
We are absolutely satisfied with the service we received and the item purchased,5
I live in  a retirement center where the kitchens have white walls and appliances so  I have added colorful tiles and pictures.  Your wooden sign is the perfect addition.  Thanks so much.  Carol,5
I had asked the shop to the sign say “fortunate accident” and they had agreed but upon arrival sign still read “happy accident”,1
Paid for rush delivery and received a day late :(,3
"We ordered this for our daughter's grand parents they LOVED IT!!!
It's beautiful and very well made!!  ORDERING MORE SOON..
I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THEIR PRODUCTS. thank you WOODLANDCREW",5
My items both came broken and I immediately contacted the shop on which they still have not contacted me back on what to do a week later after multiple emails! Their customer service from the get go was horrendous I should have steered clear from them but unfortunately did not ...learn through me and stay away from them!! ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!! I will chalk it up to a loss but will not recommend them to anyone and obviously will NEVER purchase from them again!!!,1
"The knobs are absolutely stunning!! 
The craftsmanship is beyond beautiful!! We are remodeling or we would put a pic in the review!!

"Awful customer service. Waited until after product was supposed to be shipped to ask about shipping and received automated responses. Told them I was going to open a case, my email was immediately blocked. Only received item after opening a case. Had to replace the string it came on as it was all frayed and looked disgusting.",1
"Cute design, looks nice under my cat's food dish :)",5
"super cute sign, quick shipping!",5
"So cute!! I love them. Oh yes, I'll be back.",5
"I love it and my kids too, thank you so much",5

"Perfect gift for my friend who loves zombies and coffee! 
Packaged really well (could easily withstand apocalypse).",5
Lovely item. Shipping took quite awhile though.,4
My parents love this sign. My mom hung it up right away - Christmas wasn’t even over yet and it was hanging. Thanks for quick shipping and a great product.,5
"The sign is beautiful but I’m frustrated with the shop. I ordered this sign with 5-7 day shipping. It was supposed to arrive December 27th, in time to give it to my parents. I waited and waited and finally contacted the shop in which they told me they were behind on orders so it would take a little longer. I finally received the sign on January 10. What upsets me is they didn’t even bother to let me know what was going on until I contacted them. the people I was giving this too are now back home and I have to spend money shipping it to them. The shop offered a 10% discount.. really?? Won’t be ordering again.",2
My order was late and incorrect. But they reshipped the correct product.,2
My order was Late and incorrect. But they reshipped correct order.,3
It was a perfect gift for my sister in law. She lived it.,4
It’s exactly what I ordered and I do love it. Shipping took way longer than expected. I ordered an item “ready to ship” Dec 10th but didn’t receive until almost a month later.  Just make sure you give plenty of time for shipment.,4
This setting is absolutely amazing! They are so helpful and will customize things just how you want them. They will make everything perfect. I recommend them 100%,5
Such a cute gift for my parents from their grandkids!,5
Very nicely made. Grandparents really loved it. Thank you.,5
This sign was exactly what I expected and I love it! It was a gift for Christmas and was late on shipping but the shop did communicate the delay and I do understand it was Christmas time. Wonderful product and I would absolutely order again! Thank you!,5
"I should have received my item by now, but it hasn't even been shipped. The seller has been contacted twice and my item hasn't shipped, despite having a 7-9 business day shipping time. I ordered this item several weeks ago as a Christmas present. Despite the quality of the item(when I finally receive it) I will not be purchasing anything else from this seller.",1
Terrible service. Will never buy again because of how slow they are.,1
"My son loved his sign and its hanging on his door.  Beautiful,  high quality item.  Thank you!",5
Great quality and exactly as described.,5

It was perfect! Exactly what I asked for,5
"It made a perfect
Gift",5
My parents love it. I even made  changes to my order and  they responded  rather quickly and it arrived perfectly. My mom even cries when she opened it on Christmas,5
My son absolutely loved the sign! Beyond happy with it!,5
Well I would love to review this product but I don’t have it yet. I paid expedited shipping to have it by Christmas and this company didn’t ship it as promised. I then asked twice to have my shipping refunded and was ignored both times. This is the first time I have ever had an issue with a seller on Etsy. So bummed that my in-laws didn’t get their Christmas gift in time.,1
It made my parents cry. What a beautiful sign!!,5

"Extremely disappointed with this company. Horrible customer service. I ordered this item and 5 minutes later I tried to cancel it- they refused to let me do so. I ordered a sign that said “Gigi and pops house” and unfortunately our pops had passed away 1 month ago, and I wanted to only get a sign that only said GiGis house. I explained this to the owner and she told me that there was no way to refund me or at least let me exchange even tho the sign didn’t ship till 4 days later. All I was asking was for a different item- they were still going to get my money...

I begged and pleaded with them, but got absolutely no where. 
Do not order from here. I’ve never had a worse experience on Etsy.",1
"Very cute sign, great Christmas present!",5
"Got the package alot sooner than I thought, Very cute sign!",5

Love their signs! Got this one to hang above my recycle bins.,5
"Honestly......I don't think these adorable pet mats could be any cuter.  I ordered 3 different designs and my only regret is that I didn't order more!!  Very well made, super durable and wonderfully unique. And I received them in a sturdy, oversized cardboard envelope so as not to crush them. Thanks so much for sharing your talents with us.",5
"Perfect for the table, love the colors and the simplicity!",5
Excellent quality and very fast shipping!,5

Love that I could have this personalized!! Thank you!!!,5
Love it!!! Thank you so much!,5
Super cute - took a little while getting here but it’s what I wanted.,5
"Great product, slow shipping of product.",4
The item was perfect but even more important was the customer service was top shelf. Would recommend the seller all day long. They deserve it!,5
these came out awesome thank you,5
As with the first one I bought they customized to exact colors I requested. Gift was very much loved and appreciated!,5
Perfect. Even changed the color of the print to what I requested! Thanks so much.,5
"Cute little sign, can’t wait to give this to my parents as a Christmas gift from my daughter.",4
Beautifully crafted and unique.  Very happy.  Thank you.,5
Worth the wait.  Very cool.  Thank you.,5
"Not happy with the quality. the label has a wrinkle , ragged edge where wood was sanded.I believe the quality should be better for the price",2
High quality sign that came out exactly as promised from the photos and description!,5
Shipped on time and all the signs I ordered were consistent in quality.,5
"Sign is fine.  After purchasing on a Sunday, and paying extra for shipping in 3-5 business days (so, M, T, W, Th, F, right?) I contacted again on the following Monday.  While the seller was very communicative in the planning phase, at this point I only got responses that sounded like a bot.  First they created a shipping label, which does not tell you that it shipped.  Finally on Wednesday I got a response which simultaneously said it had shipped and that they would add free priority shipping (not possible if it had already shipped!).  Received 10 business days after order.  Do not order if time is a consideration.",2
"Update: Following my disappointing experience with one of the company's representatives, the chief compliance officer of the company reached out to personally resolve the issue and make things right.  The experience showed this company cares when a mistake is made.  Would recommend buying from them.

-------------------------------

When placing my order I requested holes not be punched into the wooden signs, which they ignored.  After receiving the signs I contacted the seller.  Even though the notes to not punch holes were recorded in the order, they would not admit their mistake and instead required me to pay to ship the signs back to them as well as pay shipping on a new set of signs they would make. On a positive side, the signs are well made.  I just wish the customer service would match the product.",5
"Perfect! I got this for a friend that loves dragonflies and wine.  This was a great gift, so pretty and shipped quickly. I’m a repeat customer and have been for years! I can always find great gifts with Woodland Crew!!!",5
I have several of this shops coasters around my house and working in the veterinary field these are perfect.  Great quality and shipped in the the time frame I expected. Love this shop!!!,5
Beautiful work thank you!,5
Beautifully made and to my request of color change. It took a little bit longer than expected to ship out so if your purchasing and need it sooner I would pay the extra for expedited shipping. Beautiful work Thank you,5
It is 15 business days since I ordered my product and I haven't received. I messaged the shop and get a response it will be shipped. I keep checking tracking and it says pre-transit. My present is now late.,1
Received in the time frame that was expected.  Although colors were slightly different than picture I expected some slight differences.  Mine came on the smaller fishing knobs with undercolor of a reddish color which was brighter than I would of liked.  I didn’t see where you had a color option on that.  Also the screws that were sent did not fit on larger or smaller knobs that I ordered.,4
The sign was damaged and customer service let me know that they would be sending me a new one!,5
This was not really close to picture as far as color.  It showed three different colors. It came as grey with light and dark faded tones and looked same as number 2 camping knob.  Would of liked that they were different as advertised.  Also screws did not fit any of knows I received.,3
"Looks great, thank you!",5
Sign is not made of wood the sign is a sticker on a plank of wood. Don’t appreciate the dishonesty with the picture compared to the actually product. As well the sticker ripped and had a hole on one of the letters and it’s a gift... pretty disappointed.,1
These took quite a while to ship but now that they have arrived I am very pleased.,4
"I love the sign - it's exactly what I wanted. I took 1 star off because shipping was slow. I ordered the sign on July 22 and the item specified shipping in 7-9 business days, so I expected the item to ship by August 2. The item did not ship until August 10. Customer service could have also been a bit more responsive and personalized (when I messaged to ask about shipping, responses were slow and seemed automated). Otherwise, I'm pleased with the sign and the transaction.",4
It’s perfect for my 16 year old grandson!,5
"I ordered a customized wooden sign on July 22. At the time of purchase I was given an estimate of 7-9 business days for completion. On August 5 I was contacted with an update that my order would be delivered (not shipped) between August 8-12. It is now August 14 and my order still has not arrived. I am very disappointed in the turnaround time and that my order did not arrive on time. I will not be doing business with this shop in the future. Simply from my personal experience with this shop... if you want something to be done in timely fashion, shop elsewhere.",1
"I love my new sign! It looks just as described, and they centered the font perfectly even though my request was longer than the example. It got here very quickly too! The only thing I would change is it would be nice if it were hand-painted rather than screen-printed as I'm sure the pritning will fade or come off over time, but that would make it MUCH more expensive!  This is a great purchase!",5
Beautiful! I got these as a gift for a friend but may end up keeping them! Great quality and service!!!,5
This is the second time I have purchased this wine stopper.  The first was a gift and I loved it so much I got myself one!  Always great quality and service!,5
Looks great 🤗,5
It is a wonderful sign for my classroom door. Thank you so much. Woodland crew,5
"Would leave no stars but it doesn’t let me

Avoid buying from this company I’ve been completely let down I did my bit and paid was told 7-9 days delivery which cost a fortune nearly 3 months later and no item and blamed me for non delivery joke!! I’ve lost all my money company very arrogant with terrible customer service disgusting",1
Absolutely ADORABLE!!! My Daughter loves it. Thank you so much.,5
"Very beautiful product.  Even though it's rustic, because of how delicate it is, it looks beautiful in my daughter's girly room.",5
Beautiful work! Thank you!!,5
"I love it , thank you",5
Perfect sign .  Exactly as pictured.  Love it for my wall by my succulent bird bath.,5
Had the wording changed.  The sign came as ordered and was exactly what it was shown to be on the site.  My order arrived in the time as expected and the item was good quality.,5
"Beautiful, well made fast delivery",5
"BEWARE BUYERS! Just like all the other reviews regarding shipping, the same happened to myself. The shipping policy is stated as follows ""*Please allow us 7 - 9 business days to complete your order (these are made when ordered)."". I can gurantee they are not ""made when ordered"". It took multiple emails for me to even receive an absolute crap response. The first shipment apparently got lost.. so 7-9 business days turned into 17!! This shop should just give up entirely because that is clearly what they are most good at.",1
I absolutely love these!!!!!  Love the variety of print and patterns and just love every one of them.   Very different and unusual which I love!,5
"Adorable little magnets. My friend, who loves owls, will adore these!",5
"Super cute, high-quality magnets. Perfect for the owl lover in your life!",5

Exactly as pictured! My parents loved the gift! Excellent quality!,5
"Seller is extremely responsive! I ordered the Fawn Knob, but I requested that the knob be painted white, to match the rest of my furniture. She was able to fulfill my request as I had envisioned! Her site warned that the knobs are handmade and can take 4-5 weeks before shipment, but I was able to receive my order in less than 2 weeks, which is great! There are some imperfections on the edges of the print, but I don't mind. Would recommend!",4
Looks beautiful! Exactly what I was looking for! Thank you!,5
Loved it so much I'm back again buying one for my best friends son! Great quality!,5

Super well packaged and exactly as described. I used this a gift for my manager and he LOVED it. He said he wished the button worked lol. He instantly hung it up in his office and this was the reaction I was hoping for. He won't stop laughing at it honestly.,5
"They're beautiful and very sturdy! I would post a picture, but they're currently in storage while I'm moving.",5
Super cute looking!  It's well done and makes a nice addition to the theater room.,5

The knobs looked great but I ended up buying different screws so they could fit my dresser.,4
My sign is perfect!,5
"How beautifully done these are, I am so impressed and love them, thank you so much",5
The sign I ordered came out beautifully! The quality is great. It was a gift for a friend who is a musician and she really likes it! WoodlandCrew was a pleasure to work with. I was able to choose the font and they even sent me a mock as I requested. I also asked to expedite the order and I received it two days earlier than expected. Will definitely purchase from them again.,5
"Customer service from this shop was dismissive. Purchased item to be shipped within 7-9 business days of ordering. After 12 days, I asked when it will be shipped, response was a cut and pasted response ""Shipping Update: Your order should be delivered between May 28 - 31"". No apology or explanation for the delay- no explanation that even though the item may not ship as soon as promised, it would be delivered by original promised delivery date. I don't consider that good or even satisfactory treatment of customers. My concern or question was very reasonable. Would not recommend this shop if you want to feel valued as a customer. I can go to a big box store and be treated better. But they did send me a note saying if I order again I can get 10% off! Ha! SMH.",1
Loving my new tags so much! They are so cute and perfect for my market project!,5
"Thanks so much, it's perfect! Fast shipping too!",5
The sign came out so good and my mother-in-law loves it.,5

Great company to work with.,5
Fast shipping! Very nice item.,5
Just as described in details!,5
"The picture on the mat is very cute. However, I was expecting a nicer mat more like a placemat you would purchase in the store. This is more like a large picture that was laminated, similar to school lamination projects.",3
"Exactly as pictured, very nice quality!",5
Nicely made and works well for what I needed. Love that it has character!,5
So so cute & done neatly!,5
"Great experience.  Product was delivered as promised.  Great quality, perfect signage being used  for our liquor store display units.  Would recommend.",5

Perfect.,5

After several messages, they wrote back denying everything and claiming facts that the tracking does not support.",1

I highly recommend for a unique look in your classroom!",5

This was perfect for my nursery. It’s nautical theme. Thank you!!!!,5
Customization came out exactly as I requested it. Perfect!,5
"Great quality, made an excellent Christmas gift",5
"Really cute, but the paper is way too thin. Not a proper card stock. If you order these, ask for a good heavy card stock if you are making crafts. I had to glue matching cutouts of card stock, that I traced and cut myself. Still will workout for my intended craft. But wish the seller had mentioned the thinness of the paper!",5
"I placed a duplicate order by mistake. They shipped the item anyway, after I had notified them and they now are refusing to refund me for it.you being satisfied with the order doesn’t matter to this shop owner.No cancellations or refunds...Beware. There’s other shops out there that have better customer service then this one!",1
"I’m giving a one star review on this item due to the shop owner  
delivering my cancelled order after Inotifying them of the duplication. My order was also late but I understood due to a busy time of the year. I wrote them over 2 weeks ago without any response from them. Poor customer service. The item was Good. A little bit smaller then what I imagine but still happy with the item.",1

"Unfortunately, the item was lost in shipping.",1
Just what I had pictured!  My daughter loves the sign!  Thanks!,5
The boys Grandparents loved the gift.,4
"Absolutely love this! I needed something small for the wall that separates the living room and kitchen, which is is also the front of the house/entrance and this was perfect- it matches my rustic theme and my husbands Irish roots. Love it! Thank you so much!!",5
"My confirmation for this item stated that it would be delivered by 12/20.  When it did not come I did inquire with the shop and was unable to get any response other than a script stating that during the holiday season they do not hold themselves to their promise of delivery dates.  I tried once again to get a response just to see if I should plan on a different gift but the response was again an automated script that actually states not to try multiple times to contact them. 
I placed the order on Dec 3rd and it arrived on Dec. 27th.  
It arrived with an area that the printed paper wasn't adhered down well to the wood. 
I did contact them after I received it with this information, I was assured that it left them in perfect shape.  
I wouldn't recommend this company",2
Nice addition to my room.  Quality and workmanship is beautiful!,5
Took way longer than quoted to ship. Missed my Christmas get together even though I ordered it 20 days early. Sign itself looks good though.,3
Lettering looks weird on the wood. Took forever to get my signs after it said 7-9 business days. Overall really disappointed.,1
Imagined the sign to be bigger but it was great quality and it shipped pretty quick even with it being around the holidays!,5
"The sign looks okay but you have to pay more for it to say anything other than nana and papas house. Even if it is less words ... still have to pay $10. Also, customer service wasn’t that great. In fact no one ever responded to my questions .... they simply forwarded some email that had common questions in it. Twice. Even though my questions were not listed in that “common questions”. I get that they are busy /but I bought another item from another seller and she was super easy to contact and was pleasant. she responded to my question ....",3
"My parents seem happy with the sign which I have not seen in person. However I am not happy with this company or it’s customer service. I placed an order for a customized sign and within a short amount of time I received an email saying I had to purchase the customization within 48 hours or they would send a generic sign. I replied asking to cancel as this was not clear in the ordering instructions. They said they would not cancel the order because it was in production, but how could it be they weren’t starting it for two more days. I basically had to purchase this additional portion or my parents would have gotten a sign with someone else’s name on it. It didn’t arrive until New Years Eve with no personalized reply after I emailed a few days before Christmas. Very disappointed and I will not ever use this company again.",1
Awesome!!! My parents were so excited for this piece!,5
"Ordered this on Dec. 6th for a Christmas present.   Wasn't even shipped until December 25th which arrived on Friday Dec. 28th which was too late.  It was a gift to surprise new grandparents.   Had to come up with a plan B on Christmas Eve which was very disappointing.   If only they would have communicated the late arrival when I requested the status a week prior.  Instead, all I received was a auto reply vs a quick note that could have said, sorry we won't be able to ship prior to Christmas (the truth), then I would have rating them better.",1
Not at all impressed with sign.  Poor quality and smaller than mentioned in listing.  Took a very long time only to be disappointed.,1
Cute bottle stopper for an owl lover,5
Shipped on time. Love the quality.,5
Like that it's real wood but that's it. Wish the writing was engraved instead of a sticker for how long it took to get it shipped.,3
My order has not arrived and it was ordered Dec 4th. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift. I’m very disappointed with this shop. I have contacted them twice and each message I get back from them states they are too busy to reply to me directly and I get a shipping policy statement. It’s extremely rude and very aggravating. I will never order from this shop again.,1
The Sign Is Absolutely Perfect!,5
very nice quality piece . thank you,5
This sign was a Christmas present. Turned out perfect ❤️,5
My order still hasn’t arrived and it was a Christmas gift.,1
Item was as described and was delivered quickly!,5
"Easily the worst Etsy shop I have ever ordered from. I ordered two signs that came packed together. One came out great, the other came sticky with a piece of paper stuck to half of it. when I peeled the paper back, half of the sign was discolored. The shop claimed that that is how the sign was described on their listing and that it is considered “rustic”. I completely understand two signs varying in color, but this sign was only discolored partially where the paper was stuck to it. I sent a photo with proof that half the sign was brown and discolored while the other was a rustic white. A solid line where the paper was stuck to it separates the two colors making the sign look like junk. They refuse to send me another sign. Avoid ordering from this shop.",1
"It wasn’t worth the extra money because the quality of the work was not at all what I expected,",2
I have ordered this item several times as gifts for friends and family.  Great job and quick turnaround time.,5
Sign is cute and came well packaged,4
I was very disappointed with the quality of this product when I received it in the mail. The “sticker” was already peeling off the wood and the sawtooth picture hanger on the back was so crooked that it isn’t able to be hung up. When I emailed the company about these issues all I got back was an automated message that said any qiestions could be answered in the automated paragraph below. I didn’t ask a question at all I simply wrote to tell them I was disappointed in the quality of work and at least expected an apology and for them to read my original note,1
Very pleased with my purchase!! Cute cute cute!!,5
Quick Delivery! Easy to work with!,5
The sign was perfect! It shipped on time the quality was great!,5
The quality was not what I expected.,2
Cute sign can’t wait to give this to my parents.,5
I received the wrong item. I ordered a sign that said Gigi and Grandad’s but got one that said Gigi and Grandpa’s. Very disappointed.,1
"They are so ugly rude, 
obnoxious, and could careless about their customers simple cancel request. Loath this shop, and their customer service is not a concern of this shops. Best wishes to you",1
Loved it...granddaughter thought it was so cute for her boys bathroom,5
By far the WORST customer service I have ever encountered. This shop tried shaming me and belittling me into thinking I was wrong for being unhappy with a sign that was pixelated and blurry. Do not buy from these people as they clearly do NOT care about their customers or take pride in their work. I would leave 0 stars if I could. They should be ashamed for telling me I should “write an apology letter” to them and Etsy for opening a case and wasting their time. Absolutely appalling .,1
I look at this every day and fall in love with it all over again.  It's beautiful. Looks perfect for the location I chose.  Well made.  Well described.,5
CHOOSE ANOTHER SELL!! Would not recommend ordering from this seller!,1
Great seller. I just purchased my second set of these. Quick responses from seller and shipped really fast. Thank u so much for the surprise glitter clothespins :). I love these. I can't wait to display our pictures for our wedding. Will buy again.,5
Very cute. Great seller. Thank you for the fast shipping!,5
"So lovely and petite.  Years ago I had a pin like this, only larger.  I lost it one day and have agonized over that loss ever since.  These lovelies will help. : )",5
"Buyer Beware! While these knobs look nice online what you receive is actually something very different. The knobs I received looked like ten cent wooden knobs from Lowe's with compass rose stickers on them. You can actually see the folds in the stickers at the edges! Don't bother trying to contact the seller for a refund either, you'll just get a run around about how it is all your fault and all sales are final! Very disappointed!",1
Great decoration for the holidays!  Great seller to work with and fast shipping.,5
Super cute!  Love the colors!  Thank you so much for making these custom for me.  Great seller to work with and fast shipping.,5
Love these tags & the seller was wonderful to work with!!,5
"I'm a little disappointed in the quality for these. The photo makes them appear much more seamless than they do in person. The design is considerably off centered on one knob and the ""E"" is mostly cut off on the other. The screws that are included also don't fit the knobs! They're too big. They feel a bit sloppy and rushed. Shipping was prompt at least.",2
Love this paw coaster! Thank you :),5
"Very nice, wine stopper. Will shop here again.",5
I love these fast shipment,5
Smaller than I expected. Shipping was slow,1
"Oh my!  What can I say!  These are simply gorgeous, well made and totally fabulous.  These will make a beautiful addition to my kitchen cabinets and drawers.  Wonderful seller.  A+++  I will be back!",5
Love the coloration in the background - the pictures online do not do the product justice! Great work and great product.,5
"Wrong color, ordered deep red ie brick, what came was more of a pink, had to cover picture and spray paint myself.  Not exactly thrilled.",3
Perfect gift for a wine and dog lover.   :),5
"Perfect! Love it! Great to display around the house!
Thank you!
Jul",5
"FUN!  Love these wood hangers!  
Thank you,
Jul",5
Picture on the site clearly shows a set of four coasters when in actuality the price is for only ONE coaster. I consider this false advertisement and quite misleading.,1
Love it! Awesome quality and it shipped fast!,5
The shirt is not good quality. They are very stiff and uncomfortable. Main description is misleading. This is for one shirt not both.,1
Text us not nearly as bright as pic. Very faded.,3
The colors are not as bright as they appear hade a very faded look,3
Very nice shirts. Bought them for my husband and I and they were perfect.,5
"Never again...this item wasn’t even personalized and I received it a few days after Christmas, but just in time for next Christmas!!",1
Came as ordered. Cute couple shirts.,5
I bought these shirts to surprise my daughter and her new husband on their honeymoon.  I love them and they turned out awesome!!  It was easy to order and shipped on time.  Thank you!!,5
"Its okay. The print on the shirt didn't look as good like in the photo wasn't properly printed, kind of faded on the mug and the shirt felt like a cheap quality and felt itchy. Really wanted to wear this for a photo shoot but its not going to work.",3
"Great item and material, fun design, super fast shipping!",5
"Great item and material, fun design, super fast shipping!",5
Definitely not a small. Runs very big and boxy. Small fit like a medium and medium fit like a large. The picture makes the shirts look cozy and these are kind of scratchy. The color is darker than a heather Grey as well. Very disappointed. We returned our matching Old Navy pj's for these shirts. Sad to say we might go back and get the Old Navy ones since the fit is more spot on.,1
"Arrived timely, printed different than I thought they would but soft sweatshirt and doesn’t run too small.",3
"The sweatshirt is a great fit and really cozy. The print looks/feals like a real print rather than a quick iron on, even though it's large.",5
The shirt is very cute.  Fast shipping too!,5
Great shirt! good material. Fast shipping.,5
"Obviously got these to wear for Thanksgiving. Words aren’t at bright as I thought they would be or shown in the picture and the colors on each shirt aren’t the same, making it look like they don’t match. One is more yellow. Disappointed is all.",1
Perfect shirts for our first trip as husband and wife. Comfy and cute. Highly recommend!,5
These shirts were perfect for our mini moon trip! Wore them on the flights and the first day. Comfy and true to size. Make sure you have order in enough time to wash before you go because of the shirt creases and smell from the iron on. Happy with this purchase 🥰,5
Will work but pretty disappointed that the hats on the shirts were bright red like in the picture. They look very dull.,3
great product and fast shipping,5
"I was expecting the nice, soft looking women's t-shirt in the picture but I received just a Gildan t-shirt. They didn't look nice enough to actually wear. It's hard to see the white lettering on the pink shirt, also unlike the picture, so I wouldn't recommend that color shirt. Disappointed that I paid to rush ship these and we ended up not even wanting to use them, especially because I chose these over many similar ones on Etsy. (I also don't think rush ship was necessary but I was told I needed it to guarantee arrival)",1
"The lettering is really vibrant and cute on the white shirt (better than the pink bridesmaid shirt) but I was disappointed in the style. It's just a Gildan t-shirt like you'd wear to gym class, not the soft, nicer quality shirt pictured.",3
"The shirt itself looks awesome! However, I normally wear a size large T-shirt but this large comes down past my knees.",3
Not going to be able to use them since I did not receive my full order. They were willing to refund 40$ out of the 114$ I spent. I would not recommend this shop since the people who own it do not do the shipping and printing themselves therefore quality control is little to none.,1
Not going to be able to wear them since I only ever received 4 out of the 6.,1
"When I first received the shirts, 4 out of the 6 were good. However one of the shirts had very faded printing on it and it looked different from the others and another shirt was completely wrong and was not at all what I ordered. Upon receiving these, I immediately contacted the shop and told them and they asked for pictures, I complied, and they put new ones back into production. I informed their printing partner of the day that I needed these shirts by 4/23 at the latest. I was not met with a response, but instead earlier today received the email that it had been shipped but not scanned, therefore not stating its arrival time yet. I emailed the printer again and asked when it arrived.. no response. Then tonight at 8:56 the package was scanned and is reportedly going to be delivered Thursday night and Ill already be in Orlando.",1
Delivered early and the shop was very responsive to my questions! Everyone loved the shirts at the park :),5
Item was not as expected. Print was faded as if tank top had been worn previously. Color of tank top was more off white than white. Will not be ordering again,1
They look even better in person!! I am very impressed and so glad we purchased them!!!!,5
Turned out super cute! I only wish the cotton was softer but it really wasn’t a problem at all.,5
Initially we weren’t satisfied with the print but after contacting the shop they sent out a new order and we had no issues. They look perfect :),5
"I order the ""forever together"" couples set in white for my husband and I. These shirts look very bright and pretty in the photo but a warning for you all - this is not the case. The white is a very dull white and the words/print is very faded looking. The black isn't a clear black and the red is very dull. I am very unhappy. I'm leaving two stars because the store owners did send new ones to improve it, but they look the exact same. It is not what is pictured at all and there's no returns so now we have shirts we don't like. :(",2
Perfect for my boyfriend and I for Disney world. Thank you so much!,5
Not as it appears in the photos. Seller not willing to refund only reprint and send the exact same shirt.,1
Loved this item. I had a small problem with the color but seller fixed the problem very fast. would order from them again.,5
"Super fast shipping, as always! Ink was a little blurry (not like the first order of shirts that I purchased weeks ago) but no worries, still great! Thank you!",5
"Cute design, but sizing was off. Owner was kind enough to send another shirt in a bigger size, but the design on that shirt was extremely faded.",1
Do not like the fabric.  It's stiff and scratchy.,1
"I bought these shirts as a set for me and my bff. She thought it was adorable. I would choose a softer shirt on my next order, but the printing was great and it shipped in plenty of time to give as a Christmas gift. Thanks for a great item and great service!",5
This tshirt are nothing like the pictures. The Mrs/Mr and Santa hat are super shade blurry and dark and the look old. I was looking forward to wear this shirt on christmas. Very disappointed.,1
Shipped on time! Was a gift for a BTS fan!!! She loved it! Thank you!!!,5
Very poor quality shirt. The fabric is stiff and very cheap. We were hoping for a more comfortable shirt to say the least.,1
This BTS shirt was a gift for my niece.  Received shirt in a week and the the quality of the shirt was great.  My niece loves it.  Great customer service and communication from seller.  I would recommend SugarBae to friends and family.,5
Terrible quality. Printing was faded and T-shirt is a cheap feeling material that is very thick and stiff.,1
"Received this shirt and was not on the T-shirt they had advertised. Not a soft feel shirt at all, very heavy material. Printing was terrible. Not crisp and clean at all. Contacted company and they said they would send a new one and they did but it was just as bad.",1
Big hit with my Office-obsessed son. Nice quality!,5
"Quality of print is very bad, for one singular small print the quality should’ve been much greater.",2
"Amazing product! Bought as a Christmas gift, and recipient was so excited! Great work 😃",5
"Quality of print is very bad, for one singular small print the quality should’ve been much greater.",2
"Quality of print is very bad, for one singular small print the quality should’ve been greater.",2
Best shirt clean print and smooth fit.. quick ship and would DEF buy again for another printed tee,5
Great!! Thanks so much for the quick delivery!,5
This was a gift. Ordered a womens v-neck got a mans crew neck XL. Sent seller a picture. So disappointed but didnt want the hassle of sending it back & waiting for the right order. I guess she can use it as a nite shirt. Won't use this seller again.,1
Pictures on socks are not as shown. Poor quality pictures. Difficult to tell who was even on the socks. My daughter loved them though.,3
different sick came but my sister still liked her gift,2
"Love, Love, Love! Exactly what I wanted! Thank you!",5
Fast shipping and perfectly fine item. Colors were dull though (lots of b/w) and images were much different than the ones in the photo. It still works as a gag gift (as intended).,3
"Im disappointed, it’s Nothing like the picture! Bad quality of the images. This was suppose to be a gift for Christmas.",2
Very blurry screen print! I was really disappointed. The quality just isn't there! Don't waste your money!,1
Thank you I am sure my granddaughter will love them.  And thank you for putting up with a frantic grandma⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,5
I bought the Jennifer Lopez socks as a gift but on one of the socks it had a noticeable smudge mark.,2
My daughter will love them! Thank you ♥️,5
"Awesome design, but packaged in a tiny ball that made the shirt very wrinkled. Not ideal to give as a gift until ironed out.",4
"The socks are soft and comfortable, a perfect present for my Harry Styles obsessed friend! Also, Teesby was super helpful and responsive when I accidentally ordered the socks to the wrong address. She re-sent them ASAP to the right address and I still got them really fast. Thank you so much!",5
"Not happy with my purchase. Socks arrived - one was bigger than the other, and they didn't have the same pictures on them as were advertised. The pictures are of a much younger Harry Styles, not as pictured in the ad. Notified the seller. They asked me to send a picture of the socks, which I did. They responded - ""That is a big difference. I am sorry. I will make another pair now"". To their credit, they did send a new pair. Unfortunately, they still had the same old pictures on them. The size was a little better, but they were still not as pictured. I will put both pairs in the donation box, because I am embarrassed to give them as a gift. I've ordered a lot from Etsy. This is the first problem I've had.",1
My teenage daughter will love these socks. Fast shipping also.,4
"T shirt came quickly 
The only complaint is they stuffed the t shirt in a small package and when i received it it was TOTALLY wrinkled. Had to iron it to make it look presentable for giving as a gift",3
"Giving stars for fast shipping. Otherwise, the product runs way small and is made of cheap-feeling materials. Definitely a disappointment. But the sale itself was fairly simple.",3
"Cute socks! Shipping was prompt, quality was good and the gift receiver loved them.",5
My shirts were FILTHY when they arrived.,1
"Very, very well made and shipped fast!

Thank you!",5
screen printing was not done well so the bodice is very small and doesn’t align with my actual body parts like it does in the photo. it’s also on a hard scratchy Gildan shirt which i didn’t expect for this price. a big bummer,1
Same as pictured. Shipped quickly. The perfect birthday gift!,5
The screen print is blurry.,3
"The women’s shirt sizes are not as the picture shows. I would deff check into sizing before you order, it is really tight and form fitting. This will not fit as the gift is for an individual is very top heavy. I am really disappointed,
Should have ordered it off amazon for half the price.",1
Awesome shirt! Great quality! Accidentally got sent the wrong size and the shop owner quickly addressed the problem and sent me a replacement. I will definitely shop here again!,5
Quality of socks - not good. Not as  nice as I hoped they were going to be. Fast shipping though!,2
Cool shirt. Helpful and efficient seller!,5
"Amazing shirt, customized for Van Halen! Much appreciated!",5
Very high quality worth the wait,5
"Loved the shirt so much that I bought one for a friend, they love it as well. I recommend getting this!",5
"Hilarious shirt, can’t wait to show it off. Fits well and looks good",5
"Excellent quality, fast shipping. Highly recommend seller.",5
"Fast shipping, great quality! Thanks!",5
this was as advertised and they had fast shipping,4
Perfect!! Even made a small adjustment to the graphic just like I asked them to!,5
These arrived super fast and are super cute. Daughter will love! Thank you,5
I love the socks! i got a size 9 (my shoe size) i think they're a little to big but not noticeable. the calf part is a little tight but other than that the socks are great quality!,4
Extremely comfortable.mu niece definitely loves her socks,5
"Screen print was low quality and it was also not centered on the front of the shirt. For all the good reviews I read about this shirt, I was not impressed and would not recommend this product.",1
Really cool shirt and great shipping,5
Nice shirt!! Thank you!,5
"The teenage gift recipient loves these and wears them around all the time. We have yet to see how they will hold up after several washings, but so far, so good!",4
Finally got them it took a while for them to arrive but I loved them once I got them,4
"Bought this shirt for the play Cats as a gift to present theater tickets for my daughter. Item runs small - I ordered a women's large and it's very small and tight on my 13 year old daughter. 
The printing isn't what I expected and hoped for BUT it's fine for a few wears and for what I wanted it for. If you are looking for a 'forever' printed t-shirt, I don't think this shirt would stand the test of time or more than a few washes. Will not put in the dryer. 
Arrived timely. Well packed.",3
"funny and cute, would buy again",5
Shirt was a little too long in length but other than that it got here in time for the holidays.,4
"The quality is very good.  However dealing with this vendor was confusing and not satisfying.  I did not receive an order confirmation and thought my order did not go through.   So I ordered another shirt from another vendor.  That shirt came in before Christmas.This shirt did not come until after Christmas.  When I contacted the vendor to return it the response was, ""Can you donate it?""",1

"SO GREAT!! They were thicker than I was expecting, so that was a nice treat.",5
"After receiving a different shirt in error, seller sent the correct shirt (with tracking) at no additional cost immediately after contacting them. For what it's worth, the initial shirt was also in the mail immediately after it was purchased. 

Excellent shirt quality, as well--buy one!",5
Loves it. Thank you much.,5
"Shipped fast, my daughter loves it!.",5
"Socks are great gifts, especially when the person loves loves loves Cage. Shipped on time. Arrived in good time. Cool cool cool",5
Shipped quickly but unfortunately print quality on tee is poor...,3
My brother loves the shirt and always receives compliments on it!,5
"Awful. Seller is extremely unprofessional. Ordered 2 pair on 12/10. 12/13 tracking said they’d arrive by 12/15. 12/15 trackng said label created waiting for item. Contacted seller. She said she’d send out a new package next day ship cuz I needed them by 12/21 for a bday. told me the tracking # is the same. How would that be if she sent a new package like she claimed? The socks finally arrived 12/24. The print is dark and you can barely tell it’s Post Malone. Shape of the socks are horrid. The left has a huge square shape by toes. Right fits normal. Very disappointed. I’d like some compensation not only for the inconvenience with the delivery, but for an awful product. I’m very irritated. Do not buy from this seller. Unprofessional/poor quality product! If I could send a photo of the shape of the socks I would! Eww! So mad.",1
Not sure why there are so many good reviews. This is one of the lowest quality fabrics I have ever seen. There are visible cut marks on the sides of the scarf. Overall one of the worst purchases I have made in my life.,1

"Great quality shirt, design is really cool.  Size as described.  Fast shipping!  Thanks!",5
"This was actually purchased as a Christmas gift, so I won't be the one who will be wearing the shirt. But I am certain the recipient will love it, not only because he's a Cobra Kai fan, but because it is soft and comfortable. The image looks clear, but the shirt has a vintage-y feel. Great quality. Highly recommend. Transaction was quick and easy, Seller correspondence and updates were regular, and shipping was fast.",5
Love my shirt and get lots of laughs and compliments :),5
"Exactly as pictured. Super soft, nice quality. Shipped fast!",5
"The tshirt seems to run a little small, so I would definitely order up. The transaction was smooth and the shipping was fast though!!",5
"Item received quickly, but print quality is poor. Purchasers should note that this item is not screenprinted, and you can tell. It appears that the vendor used a low-quality image for the print. The entire print has fuzzy edges, and the colors are all muted. Disappointed in this purchase. Would not buy again.",2

"Great socks...
Cant wait to wear them. Quick shipping too!!!",5
Purchased in black. Not too happy with the how the white part of the NAH sign looked. Shipping was quick.,2
"Sizes in women's are much smaller than expected. It's a nice print but since it was so small I asked to exchange it. Had to pay for shipping back, the shop owner is unfriendly, and takes a while to respond with very little info. I pray it fits better this time so I can be done with this.",2
"It took several weeks to get my tshirt.  When i received my shirt the decal on the front was all wrinkled up. I contacted her about it and she told me to apply heat to it. I paid her to make the shirt i shouldn't have to apply heat to it. Then the first time i wore the shirt i noticed the seam on the left shoulder was apart, so i contacted her about that and her response was that's weird i check all seams and nothing else was said!",1
My brother loved his shirt will order again for me sometime soon thank you,5
Absolutely love this tank! Ty 💜,5
"The vinyls are great. Unfortunately I did not get them in time for my event. Thankfully they shared the image files with me and I was able to get someone local to print the vinyls for my wedding. Stressful, but the product was done well.",2
I love the Shirt.  But it took nearly a month to get it.,5
"Took nearly a month to receive the shirt , than I thought I was getting a onesie and got a shirt , little disappointed in my purchase",2
"The items, a hat and sweatshirt, were awesomely labeled and fit perfectly.   Not my first order and definitely wont be my last.",5
Her decals are amazing!!! I put them on a large mirror instead of a window and it came out great! So excited to use it for my wedding! Thank you so so much,5
My hangers look amazing. There was a slight delay with shipping (due to postal service) but the shop owner was great with communication. Overall I was very happy with my whole experience and will likely purchase again!,5
"The product looks as advertised however I have yet to put it up yet.  I will be interested to see if it will actually stick as it looks like it may have been put into the shipping container too early after printing or that they used old vinyl paper because it was pulling apart as I took it out of the shipping container.   Non of the other vinyls that I have purchased from other shops have had this issue.   It may be totally fine, but I did question the quality of the decal upon opening because of it.   
I will update my review when i have applied it.",3
I am enjoying this t-shirt. It both feels and fits great. Bonus: it makes me giggle too.,5
Not very happy with my order or the delivery time. It took 23 days to receive and the picture was misleading. Plus one of the jars is misshapen.,1
Great craftsmanship and funny gift.,5
"Horrible customer service & shipping wait. The shirt however,  is thankfully great.",3
Hilarious! My husband loved it!,5
"LOVE LOVE LOVE, thank you so much for a great product.",5
"VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE WAY I WAS TREATED!!!!!! I PLACED AN ORDER WAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS. A SET OF SIBLING CUPS, WHEN THEY WERE DELIVERED THE CUPS (GLASS COFFEE MUGS) WERE WRAPPED IN TISSUE PAPER!!!!! WHEN I CONTACTED THE SHOP I WAS TOLD THEY WOULD SEND ME THE DECALS AND I COULD PUT THEM ON MY OWN CUPS OR I WOULD BE GIVEN A REFUND. I INFORMED THE OWNER THAT I DID NOT WANT A REFUND (OR DECALS) I WANTED THE PRODUCT I PAID FOR.  WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION SHE ISSUED A REFUND & NOW WON'T RESPOND TO MY MESSAGES!!!!!! I WOULD NOT HAVE MINDED RECEIVING THE PRODUCT AFTER CHRISTMAS. THE ONLY REASON THEY WERE BROKEN (YES, I HAVE PICTURES TO PROVE IT) WAS BECAUSE THEY PACKAGED GLASS CUPS IN TISSUE PAPER!!!!!!!!! 
NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM NOT HAPPY & VERY UPSET WITH THE LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!",1

"I ordered a Medium in men's and received a medium in women's...I just want to make everyone aware, if you are ordering any of the In loving memory of Stormy products believing that you are helping her family in any way shape or form you are sadly mistaken...Order them because you want them and you want to pay Esty to make them for you and you want them to profit off the death of my daughter.",1
"The size was wrong I order a Medium in Mens and got a medium in womens...and anyone ordering any of the In memory of Stormy believing that they are helping her family, please order the products because you want them and you want to pay Esty's for making them...they are not in any way shape or form helping her family, do not purchase them with the belief you are helping her family",1
"This was fine, no problems with this one, but I had ordered to others size Medium in mens, and received two mediums in womens...and as far as ordering any of these products "" In loving memory of Stormy"" to help her family... it hasn't helped her family in any way shape or form...Order them because you want them, and you want to pay Esty to make them for you and them to profit off the death of my daughter.",1
"Just as described, only reason for 4 stars is I wish there was a v-neck option or more color options.",4
This shirt is awesome! My friend loved it for her birthday. High quality and comfortable.,5
"I thought the print was actually a part of the mug, but it's just like a sticker on top of a mug? It's started to fall off already and hasn't been dishwashed or microwaved. Had it for less than a week now and it's already falling off.",2
Don't really know what's going on... I placed the order on 12th January... it says my item has been dispatched on the 18th of January... and then it says it's in Melbourne on the 26th of January but it's now the 2nd of Feb and it's still not here...,1
Just right and super fast shipping!,5
"Really disappointed with this product, and would send them back except now I do not have enough time to order from someplace else for my wedding night. I will not order through this company again out of fear of not receiving a quality product. I paid $20.00 plus an additional $5, for shipping so while I did not expect high end pillow cases I did have expectations of getting more than I did. PROS: The Mrs and Mr decal looks really nice in person. While I do not know how it will wash I think it's on sturdy enough that it will hold up well in the washer. 
CONS: The pillow case they use was horrible. The material is so thin that the light colored print on my actual pillow shows through. The pillow case is from MainStay (Wal-mart brand) and the stitching looks awful on the top.",1
"Nothing,  cotton is scratchy. It is very uncomfortable,  not good quality cotton whatsoever",1
Yes the only thing I tho it was going to be like a bright white shirt it looks fetched but is ok not bad,3
Happy! Happy! Happy! Happy! Happy! Thank you very much!,5
Very happy with entire transaction. Would happily buy again. Thank you  Very Much!,5
Shirt is low quality with low quality screen print. The White Screen Print already looks faded without even wearing it.,3
"Mailman mishipped my order but I got the shirt days later. I thought I ordered long sleeve but I guess not. Oh well, thats on me. Im still gonna wear it.",5
I love it can’t wait to wear it to the concert in July,5
Color of letters and numbers looks faded but still cute.,3
"The letters are poor quality, ironed on ..Not silkscreen waste of money",1
LOVE IT!! Extremely fast shipping! Got it just in time to wear for the Bad Bunny concert. Quality of the shirt is great. Will purchase again.,5
This was my first purchase from Etsy and it was easy to find. Made it in time for the concert 👍🏼,5
After the second wash the logo erased a little bit.,3
The only thing wrong was the sizing of the shirt was way off. I suggest to order a size or two larger than your actual size.,1
"Fits just like expected. It was a birthday gift for my brother, and he loved it.",5
Truthfully I I feel terrible leaving a bad review since I’ve never had to here on Etsy. But the T-shirt was a complete let down 100%! The colors are not at all what you see in the picture! I refuse to wear it to the concert since the colors are so muted almost gray. And I ordered a black shirt and it doesn’t even stand out at all! Can’t wear it to my upcoming concert and I was so excited about it. do not order you will be disappointed in the printing for sure! My recommendation for the seller is to definitely upgrade your printer/ink and whatever  application your using to get the images ready for printing.,1
I like it.  Is strong material.,5
"These shirts are very nice quality. They are very thick. It would be cool to have a cotton/poly blend shirt option, too. Shipping took a bit longer than I’d hoped, but they made it on Christmas Eve and my son and hubby loved them. Thank you!",5
Looks very cheaply made. You can see right thru the lettering and picture. Definitely not happy. I wouldn’t be surprised if it washed off.,2
Great quality,5
It shiped on time for Christmas. Gift was on point!👌👌,5
"it is not the right size , i asked for a xsmall & it came in as xlarge",1
"Accidentally ordered the wrong size. When I asked for an exchange, seller said he doesn’t do exchanges and that the Tshirts were “made to order” , terrible customer service",1
"I bought this T shirt for my sons birthday as he's a massive Connor McGregor fan, he loved it 😊 when I ordered it I hadn't realised it was coming from America so I messaged the seller who said delivery could be anything from 2-4 weeks which was after my sons birthday but to my amazement it actually arrived on the actual birthday 😊 it took less than 2weeks, brilliant. Thank you",4
"Shirt isn't high quality neither the letters, pretty faded.",3
Received very fast.  Awesome! My daughter loves it!  Thank you!!,5
"Item looks good, shipped extremely fast in a busy part of the year and the seller answered a question I had within an hour of posting it.  Extremely timely! Very Satisified.",5
the Gift was a hit!!,5
I would expect the exact same thing from the pic. The letters are small and gathered all up in the middle,2
Thanks heaps for your product,4
I never received my shirts and I ordered it 35 days ago,1
Good item and quick shipping,4
"The screen print is very poor in quality. The colors look super faded and you can hardly see the image. The price is good, the quality of image is not. Sorry.",1
Contacted numerous times via email and messages on etsy to exchange t-shirt for a bigger size. Ignored each time. Would never but from this seller again.,1
Ordered this shirt on the 11th of December and it never turned up. Contacted the seller and had no reply.,1
Came a few days later and the print was smaller than expected. Good quality though will be buying another,3
Brilliant product. Thanks so much,5
This is a xmas present so they should love it good quality material great design very happy,5
"Didn’t come in time, and the quality is poor. Tried to reach out to owner for a refund, but I have had no reply.",1
"Great shirt! Good quality, right size. Shipped fast. Thank you!",5
"Easy to order, prompt delivery, ok quality. Does not look like in the picture though. The sleeves are slightly longer, and the neckline is higher - had to cut it.",3
"Shipping was about double the time. Contacted the seller and Etsy about that, opened a file against the seller and _never_ got any message from the seller after weeks of wait. The package happily arrived about 2 weeks late. The product is nice, but the colours are off, inappropriate for a Spyro product.",1
Speedy ship and quality product.,4
These types of products take time and consistent usage to see results. Will update in the future.,4
No changes in the ringing of the ears 😔,2
Dont know if it will help.,4
This product is great!  High quality ingredients I think made a difference.,5
"Sad, it didn't make any difference.",1
Bad svg wasn't able to use it,1
Good craftsmanship and received in timely manner. I would have preferred the measurements to be in height and width. It was a bit deceiving.,4
"Very poor packing, no padding around sign or in corners,sign was bent in several areas.  Due to the placement of the letters, you can barely make out the J in Jefferson",1
Best customer service & even better craftsman!  Will post photo as soon as we hang this!,5
"It is great, just as I thought it would be. Looks beautiful on my house. Many compliments from my neighbors.",5
"So disappointed!! The package came and I was sure it was empty. The quality of the metal is very poor. Paper thin. I ordered a similar product at Xmas from a different seller, price was less and quality was significantly greater.  I was purchasing other items via Etsy so I purchased the sign here too. Certainly not with the price.",1
I'm very pleased with my hat. Its everything I hoped!,5
These are bent. Just received today.,2
Decomatic gets 5 stars from me. Satisfied.,5
Perfect! Fast shipping! Great communication! Love them thank you!!,5
I just wasn’t impressed with the quality. It was just a thin piece of cut metal. No depth to it.,2
Perfect! Fast shipping! Great communication! Love them thank you!!,5
Super thin and cheap looking!,1
"It's okay.  The metal is a lot thinner than I expected and the image came out a bit pixelated and not very glossy. I don't think the product is worth the $26 I paid, but I still like the geode design.",3
It’s cute but I can’t use it because it covers “Texas” which will get me a ticket,2
Very fun license plate frame. Shipped quickly and arrived when expected. Thank you!,5
"I was so excited to get these. I purchased without looking at reviews. They are a little flimsy but my biggest issue is I purchased two, and unfortunately I got one that was the picture as shown and the other was nothing as pictured. It was pink and brown. Hopefully this can be resolved and I can get two matching ones..",3
"I must admit I was hesitant to buy from this shop based on some of the reviews I’ve seen previously. Some people were saying that the license material is too flimsy and thin while others have mentioned that it was easily damaged via shipping because of said material. But the pros outweighed the cons and I decided to buy a license frame for my vehicle. 

When it arrived at my home I was pleased with the packaging, it even had a “DO NOT BEND” sticker plastered across to let mail carriers know how to handle this package. The license frame itself was nicely secured inside with added cardboard and it was not bent when I got it out despite how thin the actual material is. Overall, I’m happy with how the frame looks on my car and I would recommend this shop to friends looking to decorate their car too. Thank you!",5
"Looks just like in the picture, however it covers up more of my license plate information than I wanted, but I gave it to my sister to enjoy",4
Plate frame looked just like the picture.  The print came out really nice; we are very happy with it.,5
"I love these! I bought two for my front and back plates. I have to admit that when I first got them, I wasn't super impressed, but once I got them on my car I was so thrilled with how nice they look!!",5
Its exactly what i wanted tyty,5
"soft and comfortable, got SO many compliments already.",5
I'm so thrilled with my space license plate cover. I searched high and low for the right ones for me and these are it! So happy with my purchase and so is my car! :),5
Perfect!,5
Quick ship!,5
Nice and great style of cap.,5
Very nice frame!,5
Love my license plate frames! Just as pictured & very sturdy! Thank you!!!,5
nice license plate. As pictured,5
Perfect! Goes with my seat covers!!,5
These look great on my gold car. They showed up looking exactly as I thought they would. Solid buy.,5
"Ascetically pleasing, but very pliable thin metal.  I’m hoping it holds up to wear and tear. I appreciate the unique items offered. Thank you.",4
This item is not worth the money at all!,1
It's super thin and flimsy. Not sturdy at all. I didn't even end up using it on my car because it bent and crinkled so easily.,3
"Wish It Looked A Little More Like The Photo , But Overall I Really Like It And Will Reorder Another Set In The Near Future :)",4
The color is a little brighter than I expected and it is very thin. Your plate won't slide into this frame if that's what you're looking for. It'll just lay on top. Regardless it's super cute and I love it! Shipping was super fast too ^-^,5
I love the look of them. Thank you!,5
It was timely shipping but the plates were not exactly what I thought they would be.  This is a very thin and flat licence plate frame.  I thought it would be a thicker material that would wrap around.  It looks fine and does the job though.,4
This frame is so adorable! I just ordered another for the front of my car! Thank you:),5
"Super cute and shipped fast but it’s thin, like really thin, like you can fold it in half if you wanted but honestly it’s $10 and it’s cute. I haven’t had a chance to put it in my new car yet, waiting on my new plate to get here, hoping it fits",4
"When these license plate frames arrived in the mail I was really excited with the quality and colors. After having them on my car for a week, I took my car through the car wash and the frames were destroyed. This was a car wash I go to regularly, the frames’ paint peeled off and they were bent so bad I couldn’t fix them. Really disappointed.",1
Just what I ordered! It looked perfect!! 👌🏾,5
What did you like about,4
Perfect addition to my new whip,4
High quality and got delivered sooner than expected,5
"very nice print and shipped quickly. it's just a flat frame that sits on top of the plate, doesn't have little notches to hold it or anything, which may cause some problems that others have mentioned with fit. but works fine on my car and looks very unique! thank you!",5
Just like I expected!   Looks great!,5
Thinner than I thought but really beautiful.,4
"Thank you, everything is perfect",5
"Exactly as pictured, good quality",5
"Great design, good price. I also loved the variety of designs this shop has.",5
The space license plate frames add that little special something to my vehicle! Awesome product. Thanks!!!,5
"Absolutely love the look of this. The only thing I have a problem with is that its a thin piece of metal so the license plate doesn't sit inside of it. After one car wash, my front one got a little bit bent. Otherwise, it's seriously the coolest license plate ever and looks awesome on my car!",4
"This doesn't quite fit the plate properly, meaning it covers some of the design of the plate. It's quite a bit thinner than I expected. The colour is nice, however I'm not sure how long it will last given how flimsy it is.",3
"very nice, received quickly. thanks",5
"It's beautiful, both sleek and rustic-looking. Great for a gift!",5
"Excellent service and excellent product. My niece loved the sandals, we can't take them off of her!!! I was very happy to see that the final product is exactly as I can see it on the screen and that the quality is absolutely great. Efi did a great job, responding and shipping the sandals right on time. Thank you so much!",5
"This store went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with the mockup AND that my payment went through. I made a silly mistake upon checkout, but they were patient and stayed in touch as I troubleshooted. The onesie made my coworker sooo happy :)",5
Pretty but not a pair of sandals that will last especially for the price. Sandals completely started to fall apart only a few wears. Hot glue globs were left from when the deterioration began. Be wise and Save your money for something with more quality.,3
super cute!  it is hanging in my boys room.,5
La bolsa es preciosa. Buena calidad tanto en la tela como en la impresión. Muy buen vendedor. Volveré a comprar.,5
La bolsa es preciosa y de buena calidad. Una buena compra de un muy buen vendedor.,5
"shipping took longer than expected, package never came, made no effort to help me, ignored me when requested refund",1
Cute prints!!,5
Great first anniversary gift!,5
"The onesie arrived in a timely manner and was adorable upon arrival. I wanted to use the onesie in a pregnancy announcement. It had a few wrinkles because it was folded to be shipped. I threw in in the dryer for about 5 minutes with a damp washcloth. When I took it out, there was a tiny hole on the front of the onesie below the lettering. I planned for this to be one of baby’s first outfits, but the onesie couldn’t stand up in the dryer for that short time.",2
Perfect gifts for work.  So cute!,5
The dates for 2018 were incorrect.,1
The wasn’t a case at all. It’s was $55.00 of stickers. Seriously disappointed,1
Files did not work. Do not recommend.,1
"Fits perfectly, and looks just like the listing image. (I’m lazy and haven’t mashed all the bubbles out yet haha) the image is also very crisp and clear, not grainy. Fast shipping. I have zero complaints.",5
"I liked the decal, the craftsmanship was a little shoddy, the decal did not go all the way to the edge visibly in a few places and I had to trim quite a bit of overlap on others. I don’t think I would purchase this again..",3
"Vinyl stickers came in wrinkled and too large for my 13” MacBook Pro —they were probably sized for the older. This could have been my bad, but I sincerely thought this was going to be a case. But IT IS A STICKER. So buyer beware.",2
loved the skin i ordered!!! can’t wait until they come out with tablet skins!,5
horrible. Ripped as I was taking it out and such poor quality.,1
"The shop was very communicative as far as shipping time and how to apply the skin decal once it arrived. The skin looks amazing, just like the real thing.",5
Great product and excellent customer care.,5
"I've ordered it for my 17"" laptop in custom size. Fits perfectly! 
Good quality.
Thank you",5
Hard to put on and easily rips,2
"I've ordered it in a custom size for my 17"" laptop and it fits perfectly. 
Thank you",5
"I like it! The photo is a little grainy on the sticker than expected but hey, it's a sticker! It is not real granite so I shouldn't of had expected it to look like granite, but it was made well. Overall, it looks really nice and is scratch-proof. The Seller was very informative and helpful on getting the best fit for my computer and responded quickly. I'm planning on getting a clear case to go over it, so you can see the pretty still.",4
"Très joli! Je n'ai pas réussi à éviter quelques petites bulles, mais qui ne se voient pas vu le décor. Je suis ravie.",5
It was not high quality or the quality I expected. Basically just vinyl. There was no practice cover. More dull then glossy. Not happy with it,3
Beautiful! Love it!,5
This skin shipped quickly and applied like a dream. I’ll definitely be a return customer.,5
I absolutely LOVE my new Macbook skin.  It's super creative and perfect for me. It shipped fast and the seller communicated with me about tracking availability once it entered the US.  Application was easy. You have to follow the instructions and you will have success.  I will definitely shop again. Peace and Blessings!,5
"The decal itself is beautiful! The quality is great. 

However, after spending an hour trying to align all of the decals, I just finally decided I had to cut pieces to get it to fit and it still doesn’t cover everything. 
I’m happy because I think it will protect it from scratches but it was definitely a bit of a headache. 

Thank you!",3
"Very good quality, looks just like the photos, and not too difficult to apply. Will come back. Thanks.",5
"The stickers were hard to stick and I didn't like the quality when I got it.
Tried contacting the shop but I was just told to try to stick them again.
Didn't like the experience.",3
I ordered a white background not a clear one. I waited almost 2 months to receive a clear background sticker. I am not sure if I can be more disappointed! I want my money back! Or return if possible!,1
no apple logo cut out,3
"Shipped quickly considering the country. LOVE, LOVE these skins! The hummingbird flowered one is gorgeous!!!",5
"Mine turned out very well, very happy with the final product. The white sticker that came with it was very useful in applying the actual one properly.",5
Nice cover and easy to process.,5
Almost impossible to see the design and arrived stain on several spots. Cheap packaging too...,1
Awesome! Just as described! Just what I wanted,5
"The MacBook stickers came faster than I thought. 
Putting it on isn’t very easy on such a big surface (not like on a smartphone for example), but after a few tries it looked very nice! I already have it on for a few days and it stays on very well, also the edges are good and still stick on my MacBook.",5
This cover is absolutely gorgeous and the seller is not only prompt with shipping but follows up to make sure you are 100% satisfied. The instructional video and the practice film are great resources and make this an even better purchase! Would love to do business again if I ever tire of this skin.,5
"Excellent communication with seller and very friendly, fast response. Nice product. Thank you very much 😊",4
"The decal gives my mac a bit of personality which I do love. The color on this decal isn't as vibrant as shown on the ad but that's probably because it's printed on a clear vinyl rather than a solid background.

I had an issue with my first decal but Andrew was very responsive and replaced it swiftly.

One downside is that shipping does take a very long time but I'm overall happy with the product and would purchase another decal from this shop.",4
The application was very easy after I watched the instructional video! the design is absolutely gorgeous and I’ve never seen anything else like it! Ive already recommended this to a couple of my friends 😊,4
"The picture looks different than what I received, and it took a really long time to get. I think the idea is good but was hoping for a more sparkly one, but it is rather dull. This ships from the Ukraine, so makes sense on why it took so long, but over a month is longer than I hoped.",3
"I just received my sticker today for my MacBook Air ""13 and it doesn't fit. 
It's too long unfortunately, but I thought I can could use a scissor to make it fit but the apple logo is too big, so it wouldn't look right even if the size is right because there would be space between the logo and cut out apple in the sticker. 
I am very disappointed, waited 3 weeks for a product that doesn't fit.",1
"Lovely design. Received in 3 weeks. However, I was disappointed with how the colour was not as bright and vibrant as the pictures and was washed out in comparison - the colours was one of the main reasons for choosing this seller and this design. Skin is also a lot thinner than other Mac skins I've had. Was further unhappy about the fact I gave the seller the measurements of my Mac and the skin was about a mm off - spent a whole hour trying to get it all perfect and lined up to the edges but in fact the whole thing was slightly off because it was cut too short. Not impressed with this as the price paid was a lot and more than other sellers, hence 3 stars only.",3
"First, it took almost a month to get to my house. Second, I paid $55 for three stickers??!! What!!! The top I assumed was going to be an actual case. To anyone looking at this...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!",1
"Good seller, top quality !
U can track the order easily.
Communication with the seller OK, no prob",5
"Top quality, good seller! You can buy with no doubt",5
Great communication from the seller. It looks awesome on the computer..,5
I LOVE my Mac skin... easy to apply and so elegant! Thanks :-),5
The quality is very high. The shipping was very slow (I ordered in Nov 17 and got it on Dec 17) so I took a star off for that. But I am very pleased with the art and the materials quality.,4
"Quick shipping, great product! Love it!",5
"Very easy to apply, and looks just as pictured. I’ve received a lot of compliments. Looks beautiful~",5
"Do not buy. Definitely does not look as described, the pictures are enhanced, plus the cost of shipping plus the time it takes to get to the United States is both too much. Buy from a seller in the US that actually is open to exchanging and returning as well because it took opening a case instead of just being humble and offering an exchange.",1
"I love it, it's easy to apply and it's exactly like the picture.",5
"The stickers are beautiful on my MacBook Pro and I get a lot of compliments on it. Also, Andrew cares for his customers as I had a small complaint and he was very responsive to his messages, which I appreciate. Thank you!",4
My new laptop decal is beautiful! Andrew even worked with my to make a decal custom size for my Chromebook. I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend!,5
Easy to apply and looks fantastic on my mac,5
Love these laptop skins! This is the second time I’ve ordered from this and shipping is always Very fast! The product is very easy to install and definitely would recommend this store to anyone and would order again!,5
Absolutely love it! Great product and received as stated. Great communication. Will order again and highly recommend!,5
It looks incredible. Good work.,5
Nothing like it is pictured. The skin pattern is grainy and the color appears washed out. Extremely disappointed,1
"Love it, Good Communication - thank you.",5
schneller versand und so ein schönes muster,5
Took a month to receive and took about 13 days to even ship! Ridiculous,1
The wasn’t a case at all. It’s was $55.00 of stickers. Seriously disappointed,1
"I am obsessed with my new keyboard skin! The seller was in contact with me for the entirety of the order up until delivery to assure everything was correct measurement wise and satisfactory upon arrival. The skin itself is easily applied, a little tedious placing them individually but it's a labour of love. LOVE THIS. Would definitely recommend!",5
"It's a very good quality decal. It is more muted than it appears in the photo, but I actually prefer it. It is a little difficult to get a perfectly smooth finish without any bubbling however.",5
The laptop skin arrived today and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!! It's perfect and incredibly cute and sturdy and absolutely wonderful.   Definitely would order again!!!  thanks for such great service and good product :-),5
"Great seller. Fast shipping, loved the product.",5
"Was a bit long around the top, just above the keyboard, but other than that, I like it!",4
"J’ai envoyé mon clavier pour pouvoir avoir le bon collage et je n’ai pas eu le bon, pour le prix de la livraison et l’attente!",1
Fast postage. Decal is pretty.,4
"Great quality, just like the picture!",5
"Perfect, thank you so much!",5
Nice design. It's a little thinner and more difficult to apply than some other skins i've tried.,4
LOVE this sticker! I have it for everything and it is simply beautiful!!,5
This was a good sticker with high quality graphics. You do need to realize that it is a clear sticker with the world on it. You are not just putting the world map on the laptop.,4
Looks awesome on my laptop!,5
Measurements are off but overall nice product.,3
i love this skin! Such great quality,5
"Item arrived yesterday - thanks! A bit disappointed that there were no instructions on how to apply it (had to resort to YouTube for a tutorial) and wasn't overly happy with the finish so ended up cutting around the decal flowers and reapplying them separately to get a better finish. All in all, very happy though - it looks great now :)",5
There was nothing inside the package. A complete scam!,1
Pretty good quality. Some air bubbles are hard to avoid.,4
Item as described!  Very happy,5
"Awesome laptop sticker, great quality",5
Pretty fast shipping compared to what the estimated time states. But stickers for the keys weren’t as pretty as the picture made me think they would be. I would have rather done the around the keyboard sticker than each individual key.,3
"Andrew thank you for sending the correct set for my Mac laptop! The first set that was sent did not fit correctly so you sent me the correct set without hassle!! THANK YOU!! 
I love it! It is gorgeous, protects my laptop from scratches, and was easy to put on! Now if I could figure out how I could change my design every few days because I love so many of the designs you have. :-) Thank you again you have great customer service and a great product!",5
Took about 6 weeks to get here but I love it! Good quality too,5
"The photo online makes this decal look high quality and sharp, but that is not what I received. I contacted this seller before buying to verify the quality of the image and printing and that it is high definition and he assured me of the quality. This makes me even more disappointed because I feel either I was lied to or the seller does not actually know what a high quality product looks like. The decal is blurry and does not look good. Waste of money, very disappointed. I would have ordered from somewhere else. Not going to put this on my laptop. Beware!",1
Just gorgeous and beautifully made computer skin! Worth the wait!!!,5
"The pink marble skin is beautiful, vendor is very engaged and helpful. Thank you!",5
"The pink marble skin is beautiful, vendor is very engaged and helpful. Thank you!",5
"I followed the instructions to apply it and there were no air bubbles. then overnight, it has so many air bubbles that won't go away now! Also, the finish on it makes it difficult to use the track pad, my finger seems to bounce when I slide it across the trackpad. I am going to remove it from my laptop because it just looks bad with all the air bubbles and the trackpad is annoying to use now. Disappointed I wasted my money on this.",1
Owner got back to me tentatively and refunded my purchase! I did not like the item because it was cut improperly but his customer service is wonderful.,5
"The item is fine, it was a little irritating to not have any shipping updates until almost a month after shipment. (It's fine if something takes 2-4 weeks, but it would have been nice to have known it was even in transit)",5
Articolo conforme e puntuale nella spedizione.,4
Did not fit screen right. Buttons were not the right size either. Some didn’t have the right button printed so i didn’t get to use the whole keyboard because it didn’t match mine. Very disappointing!!!,1
It’s beautiful! Thank you!!!!,5
I STILL have not received my order and when I contact the seller-there is no response! Pooooor customer service,1
"The shop owner was fantastic - he was more than willing to work with me to make a custom decal for a Dell laptop, and the process of everything involved was perfect and (relatively) timely (it had to be shipped from Ukraine to the US, so naturally shipping took a while). But I was very disappointed in the decal itself. The picture on the shop looks like the colors are bright and solid with a transparent background, but in fact the colors in the design are just as transparent as the background. They show up fine on a light background, but on my black laptop, they blended in completely and it was completely invisible. I was so excited to receive this decal, and I was so disappointed to see this when I finally got to apply it. The seller was thankfully gracious in giving me a refund, but I can't hide how much of a letdown it was.",2
"Je suis vraiment déçue, ça ne ressemble pas du tout à la photo. je pensais que ce serait un autocollant à la forme des motifs mais le tout est sur un fond blanc. Je l'ai mis pour me faire un vrai avis mais retiré aussitôt ça fait vraiment pas de gamme. Pour le prix...",2
"Let me first say that shipping on this item takes a long time! I ordered on Dec. 7th and it arrived 2 days ago, January 16th. So if you need this quickly you're out of luck (it comes from Ukraine). The colors are great and I love that a practice sticker is sent! Andrew was very communicative throughout the process as well. I have yet to put my sleeve on but will attack that today!",5
It's perfect and exactly as described! The shop owner was pleasant and made sure that my custom order was exactly how I had described it.,5
Not as shiny as I thought it would be.,4
Came with a second skin where the Apple logo is not cut out - loving it even though there are now and then air bubbles (dis)appearing. Maybe my application wasn't the best. The contact with the shop owner was great and the shipping was very fast. Thank you!,5
"Love the decal, I received it in a short time and the packaging is so great. Will definitely order again.",5
Came in as described. Very happy with purchase.,5
great sticker and communication! thanks for producing this and making sure it reached to me smoothly.,5
"The skin is amazing. Exactly what I was looking for. 
Shipping not on time. I waited 2/3 weeks.",4
"The print isn't quite as vibrant as I'd hoped, but otherwise a good experience.",4
"All good. Athough the quality wasn’t the best, I got a full refund :)",4
"The design is beautiful, but I’m not sure if the sizing was right. Could have been my mistake, but anyhow I decided to use it and trim the overhang. Still love how it looks! Put it under a clear case.",5
Love it- its beautiful. Thank you!,5
"The sticker is BEAUTIFUL and exactly what I thought I was getting! Word of advice though- WATCH THE VIDEO. It's only a minute long! I thought I knew what I was doing when I went to put the sticker on my Mac but I was wrong. I tried to put the sticker on without soap and water and I ended up with lines showing through the plastic where I damaged it from peeling it off my Mac to reposition it. Take your time and put it on the right way! If I hadn't messed it up it would have looked amazing, and it still does if you can ignore the lines I caused. I would definitely buy again!!!",5
"Patience is certainly required when applying these! Be advised, when applying the skin, be very patient in order to apply it evenly and without bubbles. The keyboard stickers, however, are quite simple. Apply the stickers one row at a time (as the stickers sheets are cut and prepared). Press firmly down on each key and slowly remove the wrapper to cover an entire row in one easy step. I also purchased the matching shell and am incredibly pleased with the fit and look of these!",5
"The stickers are relatively easy to apply - I asked someone to help me make sure things got all lined up properly because I don't have a particularly steady hand. One thing about the picture that is different than the sticker is the background. It appears silver in the photos, but was more of a white/ivory on the sticker. I do not mind this, but may be useful to know. It really makes my laptop stand out!",5
Thinner then expected but looks adorable!,4
"I fell in love with the design and I think my end product of it on my computer turned out well but there are a few things that bother me 
1) I was expecting a perfect fit, especially after I sent them my computers exact measurements and they responded saying that it would be cut to those dimensions. The cover I received was 1/2 inch too wide and I had to cut it
2) I thought the cover was a solid piece but actually it was clear where there was no design which would of been nice to know before hand 
3) there are parts where the design was scrapped off where there should be color for something so expensive I would expect the product to not already be damaged when I receive it, fortunately the scratches arent severe and I don't notice them really 
Besides that I do enjoy the product

UPDATE: Seller sent my new skin and it was great",5
"This item was delivered faster than I was expecting and looks beautiful on my MacBook Air. The skin is very true to the picture. Only complaint is the high price, but I love this unique piece!",5
"Wonderful ! Good touch and fits perfectly ! :D 
Very kind seller !",5
"the decal came with two sheet... and no instruction.. so not sure what to do with the matte clear sheet.  
The decal itself looks a little cheap - it has a sheen to it that doesnt feel right.  
After applying the printed decal, I decided to put the matte clear sheet on top of it.  The matte layer actually made the decal look a whole lot better, and I am pretty satisfied with the outcome.",5
I absolutely love the way the skin looks on my laptop. The graphic is very lifelike. Side note: It was easy to apply.,5
This was a major scam. It wasn't a decal or a skin it was a piece of paper with poor quality printing. DO not buy here. Looks nothing like the picture.,1
"The sticker that I've got was so different from the pictures in the shop: kinda faded and not so good quality. But seller offered a few possibilities for solving this problem out, he was very polite and eventually we found a way that works well for both of us. Thank you Andrew!",3
"This is way too overpriced. Does not look like the photo, rips very easily, shipping time is very long. The material is cheap and not shiny at all. Picture displayed is very different to actual product. Very disappointed.",1
"love the colors and smoothes out easily! its just barely too small for my MacBook Air 13"" so you can still see a little of the edges but overall looks fine to me. took a little long to ship but worth the wait!",4
"Great customer service, looks great and is exactly what I wanted!!",5
"It's my second purchase, got one for my friend cuz she loves it so much after seeing mine. It's really pretty and easy to apply as well 👍🏻",5
Perfect! Very easy to apply and looks just as pictured.,5
"Really pretty! However the shipping takes quite long to reach. But well, I still love it!",4
"the customer service was great but I'm very disappointed in the product.I'm sorry but this item is WAY overpriced for what it is. The image is extremely pixelated and printed on poor quality, matte paper. I think I could have printed it at home for $5.",1
"Excellent customer service, even prettier in person, thank you!!",5
This is exactly what I was expecting and looks lovely on. It was easy to apply. Thank you!,5
"I was so excited for the sticker to arrive and I watched a couple of videos before attaching it. Never been so disappointed about a product on Etsy. The 'empty' space between the leaves looks streaky and while attaching it (very carefully!!!) a piece ripped off. The apple sign didn't fit well so I had to remove it (even more carefully!!) and now the sticker is in two pieces. 
I expected a bit more from a product like this especially considering the price :(",1
"This laptop sticker is beautiful! I get compliments on it all the time. Also excellent customer service - Andrew checked in with me to make sure I had selected the correct model (luckily, because I hadn't) and very graciously let me change the address.",5
"The quality of the item is very high, I really love it. Same is the sellers attitude and corporation. The only comment I have is the long time the shipment takes to be delivered. Loved the item",5
Love the design and quality!  Was very easy to apply and Andrew was very easy to work with.  Shipping to US did take about a month.  I would buy again for sure!,5
I got this for my mom and she absolutely loves it. Thank you so much!,5
"The sticker itself is honestly just ok. The design is pretty, but the quality is not great. On top of that, shipping time is just ridiculous. I forgot what I had ordered by the time it got here. Seller responds quickly to questions.",3
"Well where do I start. How about that it took a couple weeks to be sent from the shop and then it took over a month to get to my home after shipping from the shop. Seller had no answers except to keep waiting. Box arrived soaked. Decal thankfully was wrapped in plastic on the inside but it was folded three times and had bubbles on the sheet. Still trying to flatten it back out so that it can be used (7days and still not flat). Would ask for a replacement but waiting another 45 days is just unacceptable in my book for a product that costs $32.00. Stay clear of this shop unless you are ordering for the holidays, then order now. 

Shop owner has reached out and assured that a new one is coming. Rating will increase if it is sent a timely manner and in good condition, review pending.",1
"Those are much cheaper quality then I had before. I just like the design. After using 10 days, some of them started bubbling up...",3
Absolutely gorgeous and fantastic customer service. I will buy from here again when I want a change of design!,5
Looks just like the images. Get so many compliments on it. In love!,5
Love this print! Although it is more of a cheap sticker than I had thought. I did still use it as I love the print but was hard to position without ripping or tearing.,3
Beautiful skin. Came pretty quickly. Thank you.,5
The seller is very nice!!!,5
I am in love with my sticker. It is fairly easy to apply  and looks awesome! Thank you!,5
"Great quality! The skin looks amazing on my laptop. 
The service is great too! I definitely recommend this product.",5
"Although the shipping can be a little lengthy from Ukraine to the states, this sticker is high quality and really dressed up my computer. Plus it is now protected from scratches! Must be patient while applying, as bubbles can come about. But the look of my computer is so unique now and I get many complements :)",5
"It shipped on time, and is incredibly cute! My only complaint is that its fairly difficult to apply, and in the negative space there is a lot of faint lines that you can see in the light. Overall a great product.",4
Its cute though. Quick delivery and great communication!,3
I get tons of compliments for this project.,5
"The print design is exactly as pictured. I was also happy with the nice vinyl material. I was a little disappointed in the shipping method, since it arrived crumpled up, but the shop owner was very nice about it and made it right. I would suggest including application instructions as well... however, I ""Googled"" decal application instructions online and figured out how to apply it myself.",5
"The design looks just like the image. The colors on the top decal and the keyboard are a bit more gray than purple in person, and both are great quality vinyl. 
Both the top and keyboard decals are easily to apply and remove if you need to readjust them. 

The keyboard decals are slightly smaller than the keys, however, this makes it easy to access the side of the decal to remove it or readjust it. 

I received my item about 3 weeks after placing the order. 
Andrew from DecalRow was very helpful and was quick to respond to my questions! Thanks, DecalRow!",5
They look nothing like the pictures. Very disappointing,1
Would not stick for me,1
"The apple on my new MacBook Pro doesn’t light up and is smaller than the decal. This was completely unusable for me. No fault of the seller, just not working for me.",3
"The stickers are quite nice, but they are not the right size (too big) for the apple logo on my 2019 MacBook Air.",3
Would not stick for me,1
Love it!  This product looks just like it's picture except the apple isn't visible as the sticker covers that part of my Mac.,4
Great decal. Looks wonderful especially when it is backlit.,5
The brightness of the sticker is determined by how bright your computer is so when the brightness is all the way up it looks amazing but unfortunately it isn’t always up it’s dim most of the time so I can’t always see it very good,4
I love these decals and have ordered multiple times. I will keep coming back! They are high definition and the perfect thickness so that they do not stick up from the Mac.,5
Muy buen proveedor. Buen Producto.,5
The decal is beautiful and attention grabbing. The quality is amazing and the installation is easy. Seller is reliable and shipped promptly. Returning customer once again satisfied!,5
Great painting! It's already off to be framed!,5
So... I made the mistake of a few people because I fell in love with the decal and didn’t read the description. I ordered it for my Macbook 2018 and it clearly is for the light up logo. Still looks beautiful tho and put it on the lid of my computer.,5
Just as advertised.  Arrived when it was supposed to.,5
IT LOOKS AMAZING! I love that the designer gives you an extra just in case!,5
"The apple on my new MacBook Pro doesn’t light up and is smaller than the decal. This was completely unusable for me. No fault of the seller, just not working for me.",3
The quality and customer service was amazing. It was truly a pleasure doing business with this seller. My Vigo painting is my new favorite thing.,5
"It's great, love it and am very happy! thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
"Fits perfectly! It’s beautiful! Came quickly, too! Thank you!",5
great quality! shipped as expected. could not be more satisfied and will definitely buy from this seller again at some point.,5
"It's a small thing, but I love the way it looks on my MacBook.  I didn't want a large decal and this works perfectly.  Thanks.",5
"I love the desing, but it was a little small for my computer, but that’s ok",5
Fantastic!  Got it stretched and framed and it looks amazing!,5
Very fast delivery. Was accidentally sent the wrong decal but the correct one was sent immediately when contacted.,5
Really great quality amd the size is perfect :),5
Love it! Thank you so much!,5
"Just as advertised,  cannot wait to get this on a frame.",5
Loved it!,5
"Shipped on time, does fray at the sides but good product",4
"正直、届かない可能性も考えていましたが、10日程でしっかり届きました。

商品も非常に良く、お気に入りです^_^

また利用したいと思います。",5
"Super easy to apply and it’s looks so good on my laptop!! The leaf is very fragile, as stated on the instructions I received, but you receive two decals in case something happens. Arrived very quickly and overall Im in love with the product and I’ll definitely recommend this shop to friends!",5
Amazing quick shipping (took about 5 days to get to me in the UK) and the decal is beautiful.,5
Good but has started to peel a lil which makes me sad,4
Awesome seller. Still deciding how to display this canvas. Love it! Highly recommend this shop.,5
Top-rating this even though I didn't get the correct product. The seller was really helpful and reimbursed me straight away.,5
Very happy with the quality of this MacBook skin. The matte finish is a nice change from the shiny vinyl I've used before and I like the texture. Plus the image looks great. Thanks!,5
Sooo pretty! Case shipped out super fast!,5
Wonderful!  Exactly what I expected. Arrived very quickly. I would definitely order from WallMac again.,5
"Looks great, not hard to apply at all.",5
I like it a lot but it doesent come with the apple cut out which was disappointing,4
It was perfect!!!!! Just as pictured.,5
Fast&beautiful,5
"Cute design, but the quality isn’t there for $20.",3
"This was a gift for my wife, and she loved it!  Thanks!",5
Makes my Mac look awesome!,5
This came very quickly - and its perfect -,5
AWESOME,5
It's perfect and just how I imagined it to be!,5
It shipped on time and Ryan is really nice but it didn't fit my new MacBook Pro. So I put it on my MacBook Air and it still doesn't fit exactly. It hangs over the edge a little. It does look cool but it is not as shown in the picture.,2
AWESOME,5

Doesn’t stick as well as I thought.,4
great,5
Really bad quality .. Quality totally different of the picture ..,2
awesome,5
The decal looks great! It came with very clear instructions and I love how it looks on my Mac.,5
"Love this, unique and fits great. Seller was excellent to work with when I had questions.",5
I haven't received the item.. :(,1
The item is great! I would recommend other people to buy it or similar items from this seller!,5
Love it! Thanks!,5
"Bought this for a Christmas present and was delighted with the quality,the seller was quick to get back to me when I worried it wouldn’t get here in time too. Would definitely recommend this product and seller and will definitely purchase from him again.",5
This item was as pictured and super simple to apply. For those of you who like instructions on how to place the computer skin. There aren't any but it's pretty simple. The skin isn't super sticky that if you don't align it properly like I did the first time you can quickly peel it off and attempt again. Love the way it makes my laptop look!,5
Love this item. Fast shipping and looks perfect on my Mac.,5
Amazing and shipped quickly. Fit perfectly on my MacBook Air! Got tons of compliments too.,5
Exactly as described! Love this on my new MacBook Pro! Would definitely buy from Ryan again. 👍🏻👍🏻,5
"fast delivery, Nice look for computer",5
"fast delivery, Nice addition to computer",5
While the decal is detailed the apple logo is NOT incorporated at all as it was suppose to... I regret buying this now.,2
"fast shipping and delivery, Nice look",5
Shipped on time and I got the product I expected.,5
"Great customer service (:  
I Initially had wrong shipping address but was able to effectively communicate w/seller and received my order anyways. Although the sticker / decal is not super precise, majority of the image is shown when placed on anyways. 
Thank you !!",5
"Love the look, very rustic and looks even better in person. However, I've only had it for less than a month and the edges are fraying. I've used scissors to cut away the longer pieces but it continues to fray.",3
"Delivered in about a week, came with clear instructions. Decal looks awesome no doubt but it's incredibly difficult to apply. Adhesive really doesn't like to play nice, and the little leaf didn't want to stick at first but it's looking alright now. It's the nature of this kind of product that makes it difficult but that's in no way the fault of the creator. Can't knock it, super cool 👍👍",5
"Craftsman did an awesome job. I got a 7 footer, custom made and paid extra. Now I'll be placing this at a museum for a trick or treat event as a Ghostbuster. This thing is being placed into a frame, and Rocks! :)",5
Exactly as described -- a fabric sticker.,5
"Great communication, went above and beyond.",5
"This is a great product. I love the design, the look and the feel of it. It provides protection against scratches while giving your laptop a great look. It's a bit tricky to put on just because you need to align the Apple logo just right while making sure it goes on straight. (It's easier with an extra pair of hands.) But I definitely recommend this product.",5
"Sehr gutes Produkt, würde es immer wieder kaufen! 
Auf Fragen wurde innerhalb kürzester Zeit geantwortet. Top Service",5
"Very nice, pictures are a little dark but still great 😁",4
Looks-- and feels great. Thank you!,5
Got here very quick- we love it. Thanks,5
"I love love love my sticker for my MacBook Air. Excellent quality, unique design and perfect price.",5
I wish it would stay on better,3
I'm obsessed! Everyone loves it and everyone is asking where I got it! I'll be ordering more I'm sure. Love how the light shines through.,5
"It looks great! Easy to apply, but just 2mm smaller than I would like. The corners also have a different radial cut than the MacBook Pro case, leaving a sliver at the corners. Getting great compliments on it and love the fabric texture!",4
"Great quality, thanks so much",5
Great service! Love it for sure,5
Shipped out immediately and got here way before I expected! It's beautiful and has a great feel.,5
The quality of the decal was poor and was much too big for the size I ordered to fit my MacBook Pro. I attempted to cut it to make the edges fit on my laptop which only made matters worse.  It didn't meet my expectations based off of the image from the shop's page.,1
"I bought it as a gift to my father and he loved it. I wish the printing could've had a little more resolution to it, but once you put in a frame with glasses, it looks awesome.",4
Love it! Makes my laptop so fun and unique to me! Thank you!,5
"it is not feet:(
i am really disapointed and paid more many for that.
and also it is darker than it s pictures",2
Trés bien imitée. Trés satisfait du produit,5
"This is a beautiful skin. However, the edges do keep ripping and since it's fabric after you take one string off the next follows, which is less than ideal. For something this beautiful the integrity of the fabric is not worthy of the price.",2
Perfect Product! And great Customer Service!,5
"Arrived quickly, the sticker is of awesome quality. Perfect for my macbook.",5
Sieht super schön aus! Außerdem kam es überraschend schnell an!,5
"This is my favorite art piece and I was ecstatic to find there was actual MERCHANDISE for it. It's a unique way to express myself on my mac. I do not wish to tarnish the overall quality of the mac with sticker residue; this product is similar (but NOT exactly equal) to the sticky decals you put on windows for seasonal decoration. I am satisfied with the coloring and the size. 

8.5/10",4
Ryan is very responsive and helpful.,5
"Lovely! Delivered quickly, high quality, and looks great on my MacBook. Easy to install and eliminate air bubbles, so it fits perfectly!",5
"This is perfect! I bought it at the beginning of the week and it came so quickly. It came just as pictured, the graphic is more like a vinyl than most of the skins I have purchased in the past, which makes it more realistic and much more durable. It went on so easily and it looks amazing. I will definitely be back to purchase more!",5
Very fast shipping.  Looks great!,5
Love it! Arrived quicker than expected in perfect condition. Will definitely order from this vendor again.,5
"Package came quickly, looked great! Put it on and it made my MacBook instantly more awesome, in my opinion. Went on fine in the first application and has stayed on perfectly since. 5 stars!",5
"I wish I read the title better.. I didn't want a sticker.. Maybe next time in the description it should just say marble skin. Not everything else, gets confusing.",1
Looks exactly as pictured and went on easy! Love it so much! Thank you! ❤️,5
A picture is worth a thousand words. The pic from the designer is spot on. Or off I should say. It is slightly too small.,4
I purchased this as a Valentine's Day gift for my fiancé. I also had it framed! He absolutely loves it and cannot wait to hang it up!,5
"It's nice, just wish it lined up better",4
Came on time thanks!! Awesome,4
"I love this item, it looks absolutely fantastic on my Macbook. However, due to the type of material that it is I am continuingly having to cut stray fabric from the edges, this is why I have only given 4 stars. Other than that it is an amazing product with easy application. Definitely worth the buy.",4
This is a very nice decal high quality kinda took a while to put on though,5
"I ordered my two skins on a Sunday evening, and they were shipped out on Monday. They arrived on Thursday, and I could not be happier with them! They were a little tricky to get placed, but that has nothing to do with the decals themselves. It is just difficult in general when applying something so detailed in regards to the apple being cut out. I LOVE the skins, and my wife is extremely pleased as well. 100% would recommend to anybody looking to purchase a skin for their Mac.",5
"super cute, i have the coolest laptop in town",5
"Bought it as a present for a friend who is obsessed with Van Gogh, and she can't stop talking about how great it is!
Great quality and was received on time! 
Really satisfied with the purchase, and will definitely recommend this Etsy shop to all of my friends who are Macbook owners!",5
"Bought it as a present for a friend who is obsessed with Van Gogh, and she can't stop talking about how great it is!

1 excellente qualité et se pose facilement..,4
"Excellent product, easy to install and fits perfectly",5
Shipped quickly and looks darling.,5
Exceptionally detailed and well made.,5
Neither of the decals stuck to anything. They're stickyless.,1
very good quality thanks :),5
"This time, I bought this sticker for the first time, I got good and fashionable impression, but, i don't know why the pedicle of Apple mark   comes off soon.",4
I didn't realize that it was a skin and not just a cup of coffee. Looks nice but not for my use.,4
"Fantastic, I get a comment every day!",5
"Envoyer à temps,  très bon produit ! 
Satisfait ! 😁",5
I love my marble decal for my MacBook! It fit great and I like the helpful note attached.,5
Took a second try to get the product shipped to my location but the seller was more than helpful. I will definitely keep my eye on this shop for more products.,4
Frays on the edges almost immediately after I received it.,3
"Very beautiful, strongly recommended, nice service also",5
"It's beautiful! Looks really classy and expensive. Love the feel of the cover. I wish it was just a TINY bit bigger to cover the entire laptop, but I still love it!",5
"Great purchase, love the skins.  Thank you for the quick shipping and order clarifications!",5
I love this decal!!! It's so clear and looks great on my Mac! I'm definitely buying from this seller again in the future!,5
"These skins are awesome.  A very good quality.  Thicker and stronger than I thought.  They look really, really good. VERY HAPPY with these.",5
"Quick shipping! Don't know how it will work out yet, as it is a Christmas present, but the design is lovely... Thanks ;)",5
"Very fast, good quality, and great deal",5
