Nice Item
","
I don't know about guitars, and it's my first guitar which found today. I'm impressed from this guitar. It's true value of your money. If it will not play well, atleast it will be a nice show piece hanging on your wall.

Satisfied with the purchase.
","
wood: ok.action: nice and doesn't need much efforts.pick: nice and flexible enough.Product is up to the mark, but steel strings instead of nylon as mentioned. Comes untuned and takes hard time for tuning, but once properly tuned, sounds good. If you are a beggginer, and want to learn guitar it's a good deal for you.

No truss rod , atleast in my guitar. But rest is good for beginners.
","
I returned it , reason , no truss rod. For people who doesn't understand, it is a rod that is fitted inside the neck because guitar neck bends after a certain time (and that certain time may vary) , especially guitar with steel strings, making the guitar really hard to play or sometimes unplayable. I am not a guitar pro but i do have some experience with it.I really do wanna give this guitar 2.5 simply because rest else is good, as far as beginners go, of you are really low on budget , need this for some time , maybe a year i don't know i am not a pro. But for beginning with the cheapest you can get you are not gonna get anything cheaper than this and at this price better than this.I hope this helps. üòÄ

A good affordable guitar for beginners and enthusiasts. Build quality material is average, one that you would expect from a Rs 3K product. But this is not a downer. The sound produced is very good with a rich timbre and resonant tone. After a little tuning you are ready to rock-n-roll. The product was properly packaged. Delivery time left a lot to be desired and can be improved upon considerably.

Hi, I am writing this review after 1 week of practice. I just ordered this as a beginner and with doubt as I am 5.11 height.But, it exceeded my expectations and was in fine state for my arm length and height.I don`t say, it was the best.But, after all you will get what you pay for. And for the price of Rs:1,999/- I am more than satisfied with my purchase. Thank you amazon for the super safe packaging and prompt delivery.

for the price, it is perfect. at least better than kolkata made stuff. but it does not have an adjustable truss rod with an ln key, so will counter bending issues.

Pathetic Product.. Absolute Waste of Money..!!
","
This is a pathetic product and one star is also given because there is no negative option.firstly the build quality is very poor and if one is serious even for using this product for a decent period of time, I doubt this will not work.secondly there are lots of parts missing in most of the cases. there are many who are suffering as per the review of other customers as well.In my case, strap hose is missing due to which i cannot attach strap to the guitar.Amazon does not offer facility for pickup at most of the areas except top cities even though the product is delivered and fulfilled by Amazon.. another pathetic service from Amazon part.I guess even if one is a first time user and is tight on budget, do not go for such an inferior type of guitar.

The product has poor material. The neck broke off the second day itself while tightening the strings  to tune, i could not raise the complain just because I had presented to my daughter and she was really upset ,so I had to use fevicol layered into the sliced broken neck and stick it back.

Great Value for Money for Beginners

The guitar is unbelievably low priced -The best value in the market we saw. Though we wouldn't recommend it for advance guitarists - it is ideal for a beginner. The only caution is that it's an adult size guitar so not suitable for a very small kid... Please read the sizes mentioned clearly on the product.

Go for it! I was skeptical because of it's cheap price but the performance exceeded expectations. It is a bit smaller than standard size, but good enough even for a adult beginner. The quality may not be as great as other branded ones. But at less than half the price, it is best for beginners.

The guitar is of poor quality.The distance between the string and the fret is very high and playing some thing on first fret is really punishing.You might feel it would get better as you use it.. not at all..It suits better  to pose for pics..
