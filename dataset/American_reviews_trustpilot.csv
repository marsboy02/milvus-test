0,I bought first class tix from Tampa to Providence RI (connect ia DCA).  Weather & mechanical probs on both flights (no prob- it happens).  However our connecting flight had no first class available (again no prob - lets just get there).  So i ask for a refund on the non first class portion of the flights.  First is $400 and economy is $200.  I get $58 back. No explanation no one to contact.  I'll avoid AA in future.
1,"We booked our vacation through Sandals, including airline tickets. Our flight was supposed to leave at 6am and we had an hour and a half for the connecting flight. Our flight was delayed and therefore we would miss our connection. The next flight was 18 hours later, not happy. So we did not get to spend our first night at the resort. On top of that our return flight was delayed 1 1/2 hours. I would rather walk than us American Airlines again"
2,"They were sending me to the wrong city. It was completely their mistake. However, since I didn't realize until my layover, they would do nothing to fix it. Tried to charge me $1000 for new tickets to fix their mistake. They said I should've caught their mistake and since I didn't, (at 5am), it was my fault. I will never fly American again. Also, no decent inflight services. Basically, they are always a disappointment. This time they outdid themselves with their extreme levels of incompetence, apathy, and uselessness."
3,"I paid over $200 for Main cabin plus because I am 6 months pregnant & incredibly uncomfortable.  For all four of my flights to and from Boston, I was told they gave my reserved seats away & that I would be reimbursed.After weeks of emails ( they have nobody to contact by phone), they told me sorry but seats aren‚Äôt guaranteed.The ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù to Main cabin plus was a complete scam.  I was crammed in a middle seat in the back of the plane, while having to get up and bother my neighbors for frequent bathrooms breaks & leg movement.  On our flights from Boston to Maui there was no food given or available for purchase (both over 6 hour flights).  NO free entertainment or option to purchase wifi.Total Scam."
4,"I wish that it was possible to rate American Airlines Customer Service less than one star.   This past summer in Europe was the worst experience of my wife and myself flying anywhere in the world.   American Airlines Customer Service could not have been less interested in remediating our covid-caused flight changes.   The AA ""Customer Service"" seems to exist only to be able to tell customers that they are not going to do anything for the customer.   They must be trained in the fine art of saying ""No"" while repeating the mantra that they are ""Customer Service"" and really care about you as a customer."
5,"they cancelled our flight at 11.25pm 10 hours before our flight, already at Heathrow airport. 4 months on despite promises of compensation nothing has been received - they ruined my moms 70th Birthday and couldn't care less. I've had confirmation all forms received for compensation 2 weeks ago but still nothing, they don't care- not replied to messages and replied to some without actually reading the message. disgraceful....."
6,Me and wife are newlyweds. We're traveling on American to our destination when changed our seating arrangement.. we had assigned seats ridiculous.. had to ask to sit next to my wife.. crazy business totally unprofessional of a company.. Also had assigned seat coming back same thing terrible company unacceptable..
7,"Wish I could give zero stars. Bottom line:  AAL simply does not care about passengers. I am canceling all future AAL flights, canceling my American Advantage membership and writing a complete review to The US Department of Transportation. AAL needs to be sold to a competent airline operator or fined out of existence."
8,"American Airlines honestly was disappointing, to say the least. I previously put them in a higher tier than many other airlines, but they proved me wrong. My wife and I were delayed an hour during an already very long international flight from Fl to PA and then to Ireland. Because of the flight being delayed, we almost missed our international flight (we barely made it, we were the last ones on the plane), and to make it worse, the flight attendants said they couldn't even serve snacks or refreshments (we paid extra for alcoholic drinks). Then on the way home, we paid extra for all-day internet, and it did not work at all. To be fair, the stewards were very apologetic in these scenarios and very nice, but unfortunately, this does not make up the money we spent on extra conveniences which were not received. My wife tried calling the airline to see if they could offer some compensation for the money we spent, but not only was the customer service not helpful they said they needed us to write an email basically explaining the same information, which to me seemed very redundant and ultimately defeats the purpose of having customer service hotlines. Finally, they responded a few days later, basically stating that we got to sit on the seats we purchased and that essentially nothing is guaranteed, even if we paid to receive extra services."
9,"I booked a flight via their website, but they didn‚Äòt accept my german VISA credit card. So I was passed on the german website of American Airlines, booked it there and received a booking confirmation. Then, at the airport check-in they said that my flight is not paid yet even though I saw the blocked charge in my credit card account. I offered to pay once again at the check-in, but was not possible they said and I had to book a whole new flight. Price was twice as much then!! What an effrontery! Be careful in case you don‚Äòt book via the .com website of American Airlines! That‚Äòs a rip off!"
10,They are the worst company to deal with during the recent storm we were cancelled due to the airport being closed they put us on a flight the next day but that was cancelled as well our only option was fly from Miami on the Thursday as mco was still closed they would not pay or help with the cost incurred to get us there no help what‚Äôs so ever the food on the plane was inedible DONT USE THEM
11,"Flight cancelled, sent us to a destination that made it impossible to catch their transfer flight, no more flights till tomorrow, they refuse to pay for a hotel..."
12,"Pack some food, you may not get any, even on very long transcontinental flights. When contacted AA explained that food isn‚Äôt guaranteed‚Ä¶ no apologies."
13,"Trice and Charnette from American Airlines Chicago O‚Äôhare Airport customer service were the BEST!!! Trice helped me with my flight, my stay, made me feel like a special customer!! Thank you girls!!üòçüòç (ps: there was a total a.hole didn‚Äôt want to help at first. So look for a friendly face!!)"
14,"Many years loyalty with AA and they don't  care. Stranded at the airports several times because they over sold and lied that there were no other flights out... i was booked early. However, I was found out later their were several flights available. Recently, experience that they kick me out of the selected seat have confirmed, to the back of rear airplane. This is what they said they care about the elite members. Call AA is not able to resolved it. I hope they need to improve their service and care about their elite members, by be fair and trustworthy."
15,We flew AA from Detroit to Chicago where we were supposed to catch a flight to Los Angeles. In Los Angeles we would board a cruise ship. When we landed we were told our flight had been delayed due to mechanical issues. Ticket agents tried to find a flight that would get us to LA. Boarding was at 1:00. There were no flights available. So we missed our cruise!AA gave us six meal vouchers. None of them worked. They put us in a hotel. No luggage. We got up early the next day to catch a flight back to Detroit. This flight was pushed back again and again. I contacted AA. They offered us 2500 air lines as compensation for a $2300 cruise. I contacted them again. They gave us $350 credit each. I tried again and they added another $200 credit each. This is NOT acceptable compensation. AA should reimburse me the price of the cruise!
16,It is damn near IMPOSSIBLE to get a complimentary upgrade on AA.I am a LIFETIME GOLD MEMBER and have flown just under 2 MILLION MILES as a customer since 1990.I alway request the upgrade when making reservation...NEVER score the upgrade.
17,AA has lots of issues but still better than most other options. Way better than United imo.
18,I had a flight cancelled on the day of flying and had to sort out alternative flight with them. They were not very helpful and the delay was over 4 hours. i complained and so far they have taken until now to rspond. they offered ¬£260 compensation which I understand is half of the standard amount and still having problems with no response. Anybody got any ideas
19,"Please do not fall for their marketing ""value of tickets never expire and you can make unlimited changes"". I found out my tickets expired in July this year when medical issue prevented me from using the ticket.  Do better, American Airlines. Taking my hard earned money and taking advantage. My choice will be to take my business somewhere else."
20,"American airlines is the absolute worst! In the last three trips I've taken, twice I was unable to get a wheelchair and had to walk, and put myself out horribly, in order to get to my gate, and now I'm sitting waiting for a flight with two other people I was supposed to be traveling with, and after spending over an hour on the phone 2 weeks ago, I found out our seats were never properly assigned and nothing that was requested was ever done. They have the absolute most horrible customer service of any airline I have had to deal with.  Then, they tell me it's my fault because I didn't double check to make sure I had seats even though I was told that I did. They are nasty, rude b****** and never want deal with American again. They can't even be nice about it. Amazing how people could not do their jobs, be rude to people, and do everything wrong, and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about it. They don't have a problem, they don't lose their jobs, they're not uncomfortable, they're not the ones that can't walk for 2 days after traveling, they couldn't care less. Save yourself! Do not use this airline"
21,"Trice and Charnette from American Airlines Chicago O‚Äôhare Airport customer service were the BEST!!! Trice helped me with my flight, my stay, made me feel like a special customer!!

22,"Our experience on a flight from Nashville TN to Frankfurt Germany has been awful. We did this same route 10 days ago leaving Germany and it wasn't nearly as difficult or upsetting, but honestly both trips had me in tears at parts of them.Most of my grievances are specifically with the Charlotte/Douglas Airport American Airlines employees. The outward bound trip had almost a 3 hour delay getting on our connection flight from there to Nashville... this was after the first long leg flight from Germany to Charlotte, so we already had a 3 hour layover as we had to customs in NC and collect our bag and bring it for drop off to our connection flight to Nashville. After doing all that we end up being delayed almost 3 hours (so 6 hours total at this Airport).... we could have rented a car and drove to Nashville in that timeframe which we would have preferred honestly because then maybe our toddler would have gotten some sleep. Once we finally made it to Nashville the baggage crew had us waiting almost an hour for our bags. Now coming back to Germany trip is where it gets worse.... Nashville flight to Charlotte everything was fine with exception the plane we had this time had like micro storage above that no one could fit their carry on bags which caused a lot of bag drop off and pick up at flight gate and of course our travel stroller is the last item that comes out getting off that flight in Charlotte NC to transfer to our connection to Frankfurt Germany.At that gate (D9 specifically) in Charlotte NC is where I was having to deal with the very rude woman at the gate and that's where I'm positive I also ended up leaving behind my brand new jacket while I was being rudely talked down to and ultimately had to just walk away to avoid further confrontation with this American Airlines employee. This all started with boarding the gate when the woman employee requested I fold down my stroller, so she could check its size in the metal carry on baggage thing they have near gate. Ok no problem I'm confident we will not have an issue as it's the same plane we took coming here and I know the travel stroller fits in the overhead with no issues (Joolz Aer -specifically super lightweight and compact for airplane travel). My husband and child continue boarding as we have a carseat to install and need the time to do this, so I'm standing there with my stroller on the measuring thing and it fits perfectly when she started telling me NO it's too big and comes right on the max line for size and demanding I bag and tag it. I question her on this and said it was no issue coming here and fit fine to which I'm told, ""I don't care what they let you do on that flight you're not allowed to bring that stroller as a carry on because I say it wont fit and I just told some first class couple the same too about their stroller, so if they can't bring it neither are you!"".... OK wow, so I tell her my husband has the travel bag in the carry on suitcase and I need to leave and get on the plane to get it from him and I'll be right back then to which I'm getting all this attitude from her and she began saying things like well that's not my problem I didn't tell him could go ahead and board... blah blah blah. I quickly board and get the travel bag from my husband and run back out to the gate entrance to bag and tag the stroller. While doing this I sit down my jacket close by and then become rushed by an different attendant about tagging the bag. I ask her to give me a minute while I bag it and she sticks on the tag and hands me my receipt and tells me to bring it the gate drop off where I saw someone else leave their stroller near plane entrance. I pick it up and turn to grab by jacket when I'm suddenly screamed at my the original rude attendant to drop it now and do not carry it anywhere or we're going to have a problem... ok WOW. Really...is she for real saying this to me and no one blinks an eye!? At this point I want to explode on this woman as she is really pushing me, but because I did not want to escalate an already tense situation I sat down my stroller and walked away back onto the plane. Only at take off do I realize I walked off without my jacket and I'm sure I will never see it again with that woman working the boarding desk. No one on flight was willing to help either with contacting the desk and at least putting my mind as ease about my jacket, so now I'm on a long haul flight paying $30 to use their slow internet to try and submit an online lost and found ticket and writing this review while it's still fresh in my head."

25,"Flying from UK to Hawaii. American Airlines changed our flight without informing us. Luckily we noticed in the week before. This change meant we would arrive in Honolulu two hours later, therefore missing our connecting flight to Maui where our hotel and hire car arrived. This was the last flight of the night, therefore we had to sleep in the airport and miss a night in an expensive hotel we'd already paid for. We called American airlines to try and find a solution, they just kept offering us flight's that got us there even later!! They offered a ¬£50 credit to use on American Airlines which we'll never get to use and doesn't help with the financial losses suffered.Terrible!Plus, no food whatsoever or blankets on the 5.5 hour flight from LA to hawaii ! Freezing and hungry"
26,My 20 year old daughter flew out of Heathrow to Chicago with American airlines (AA) on Oct 23rd. She was also booked on a connecting flight with AA to Buffalo that same day. Unfortunately the original AA flight to Chicago was diverted to Iceland because of a medical emergency. This delay meant she missed her connection. My daughter booked both flights through British Airways (BA). At Chicago passengers were told that AA would sort out any missed connecting flight.  They refused to help my daughter as her flights had been booked through BA. There was no-one at Chicago from BA either to help her. She had to book a new flight at a cost of $330  to get her to Buffalo.  We thought ut would be easy to get a refund for the missed flight- big error on our part. AA are refusing to refund her as they say it's BA fault. BA are refusing to refund her as they say its AA fault. Both companies have been shocking and should both be ashamed of how they have treated a young girl and left her out of pocket.
27,"We were supposed to go on a trip in July but due to circumstances were unable. In July, American Airlines said that we had until the end of the year to make a new reservation. Fast forward to yesterday and I spoke with a supervisor. I gave him the new dates to travel and after almost an hour on the phone he said it was all taken care of and because the new tickets were less than our originals we wouldn't have to pay anything. He said he would email a confirmation email after the call. The email never came, so I called today. They had no record of my call from yesterday and there was nothing in their system that said I had any flights booked and there was zero notation about my previous call. After an hour on the phone they finally got the flight booked except it was going to cost almost $900. I couldn't pay that so they said they could redo all the tickets in economy, so after another hour on the phone they changed it and I was going to be charged... $730. Then after a half hour on the phone arguing that they should honor the price I was already told, they brought it to $334. I was trying so hard to be polite but they wouldn't budge. So, I went from paying nothing to $334 because American Airlines doesn't honor their own prices, and spending hours on the phone. Will never fly American again, and you shouldn't either."
28,"On November 5, 2022 I had a flight going to Puerto Vallarta out of Manhattan, KS (MHK) at 6:04 am which is 10 minutes from my home for my son's wedding but this flight was canceled at the last minute. I called several times to make sure the American Airlines app was an error in which it wasn‚Äôt. I had to rearrange my flight and book out of Kansas City (MCI) which is 2 ¬Ω hours away.This incident not only caused me distress, anxiety, and a major risk in the middle of the night trying to catch a flight but also additional funds lost and spent. I arrived a day late and lost $398.40, paid for additional gas $65 to get to the airport, paid for food $60 for the overnight stay and the next day travel, paid for parking $32.50, and numerous emotional breakdowns on the way caused me PTSD and swollen legs from the numerous flights and wait time. This is unacceptable and I demand compensation for the major issue American Airlines has caused. I also paid an additional ticket price for the departure and return to MHK instead of MCI for convenience.The stress of getting to my destination ruined my whole vacation. I also had to drive back home on November 9th 2022  in the middle of the night on a dark highway 2 ¬Ω hours away from home. I didn't get home till 2 am on November 10th 2022 when I could have gotten home in a matter of 10 mins if this issue didn‚Äôt occur. This situation has stressed me out, depressed me, and tainted my view of traveling and ever booking with American Airlines and I demand compensation and a response to this issue as soon as possible and not just a $50 credit."
29,Wish i could give 0 stars! They canceled last minute claimed they were sold out. I looked after and saw flights going out. Very very unhelpful.
30,I'm so upset they make these extraordinary offers and say that you're insured and that your flight will be taken care of if you need to make arrangements or need somewhere to stay they didn't do anything for me and I paid for the insurance and they didn't do anything the insurance company wouldn't even answer the phone and I had to travel during a hurricane scared and they did not care they lied on the website and said that the flight could be changed for free but when I went to have help to get it changed no one would help me do not waste your money time or efforts on this airline you will regret it I know I sure did being stuck in another state and not knowing what's going on and you buy insurance so that if something does happen you're good and then you're not good that insurance is it worth the paper that it was printed on so save your money and your time and try a different airline
31,Normally I expect to be treated like trash flying economy but I was flying first class round trip and I was shocked at the service. When you fly first class with AA you get no greeting or hello. A racist look up and down making sure you didn‚Äôt upgrade yourself just grabbing a seat from economy. You also get an attitude and a bag of peanuts and one drink. Flight attendants act like they are doing you a favor and can‚Äôt be bothered to provide service.Also there is no lounge access for first class flyers unless flying international. Oh and they overcharged for my upgrade. One upgrade said there would be free alcoholic beverages we received nothing. Never flying AA again. Lesson learned.
32,"I hope this reaches the masses. This airlines strives for your loyalty. The propaganda they present about all the perks and rewards are superficial. Please do not be drawn into their words and advertisements. The fact that they strive for your loyalty but show ZERO loyalty back to you when needed is prevalent at the most in opportune time. I was a big advocate for this airlines being that I fly between 3-5 times a month. The perks for being a loyalty member were ok at best. The more you ride the train the more you see that loyalty is just a number. When you ask of them in a time of need, they will not be there. All you are is a number when it comes to their customer service. I booked a flight 5 months in advance. Their policy is within 24 hrs of booking you can cancel for a refund. I cancelled within 48 hrs and all they would be willing to do is give me a flight credit of the amount spent ($2500). They do not budge and the lack of loyalty in return is magnified. Spare yourself the stress and find a more customer orientated airlines to be loyal too. Let me add that you cannot talk to someone physically over the phone in their customer relations department. You‚Äôre Left with submitting a form and waiting for their response which is 7 business days."
33,Thought I would give ‚Äò‚Äòem another try. Too reminiscent of the US Air days to use them again. Back to Delta. FYI their customer service is terrible.
34,"I had a flight scheduled through this Airline from Indianapolis to Dallas and Dallas to Seattle. Instead it took me to Phoenix instead. Second issue is they did not do preventative checks and maintenance between flights from wherever they came from to Indianapolis and from there to Phoenix. Our flight got delayed causing me to miss my flight to Seattle. I was on government orders by the military and needed to get to Seattle to switch airlines and get to my overseas destination. Customer service at Phoenix sucks and they told me my baggage somehow made it to the Seattle flight as I was told that night. When I got to the airport next morning, I found out that the luggage was still at Phoenix. My next problem was due to trying to make it on time to my government purchased flight, I asked what is the earliest time I could get to Seattle they said 0830 and I thought she said morning. Woke up next day and looked and my boarding pass said pm. When I need to be at Seattle by AM. I had very little time left to get to Seattle now and booked on another airline to hopefully make the next flight on time after getting luggage and then recheck it but now instead after the purchase on the other airline I find out my luggage is still at Phoenix and the office isn't open in time for my next flight. This is the worse airline I have experienced, traveling on Federal orders and this is how I get treated. I appreciate the vouchers however but goodness someone needs to pull their head out their butt."
35,"I fly a few times a month out of ohare and usually use united (not great either) but, American has been terrible and especially the last 4 flights I've had with them (I booked with American only because of availability and timing). Every flight I've had with them had either last day cancelations or was delayed significantly. They do not give realistic updates and tell you boarding is happening soon even if there is clearly no plane even landed yet at the gate. They habitually over book and request volunteers to move flights the day of and force the gate checking of carry on luggage because of their inferior aircraft overhead space. I'm not one for reviews but don't book american if you literally have any other option."
36,I had a flight cancelled on the day of flying and had to sort out alternative flight with them. They were not very helpful and the delay was over 4 hours. i complained and so far they have taken until now to rspond. they offered ¬£260 compensation which I understand is half of the standard amount and still having problems with no response. Anybody got any ideas
37,DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES!!!Let‚Äôs start with arriving for my flight on 11/4 that was suppose to depart at 6:59am for LGA to RDU. It never departed until 12:35pm but not before all the passengers on the full to capacity plane sat on the runway for over 2 hours before we returned to the gate and deplaned. There reasoning was due to the bad weather at RDU which was partially a lie because it was foggy there until 10am the latest. NY however was foggy. So after departing at 12:35pm and finally arriving at RDU and out the plane by 1:45pm it gets worst. Due to the above complications my return flight to LGA for 4:59pm on 11/4 had to be switched. I explained to customer service what occurred which was no fault of mine and they still made me pay a $150 to change the flight to a later time for my daughter and I. Okay so I paid it and was scheduled for the 7:30pm flight to LGA. Upon my arrival back to RDU to get on my flight which was set to depart at 7:30pm and what do you know flight delayed until 10:30pm then while still waiting flight delayed to 11:15pm then next thing I know flight cancelled. So I call customer service to find out what‚Äôs the reason and can you believe the reason is they have no crew members. They provided no hotel accommodations so my child and I was stranded in the airport and I had to basically negotiate my $150 refund back with customer service and I am still sitting in RDU waiting to board another flight to get back to NY. Mind you it is now 11/5 and oh yeah only new flight I was able to get from them was going to be at 6:59am to JFK and my car is parked at LGA where all this madness started. Despite all this I spoke to three customer service representative who were very helpful out of the 15 I spoke to over the last 24 hours of madness. The utter lack of compassion and respect for the customers is very disturbing. As a major airline they need to be more transparent on what is occurring so customers can make appropriate  decisions or alternate preparations.
38,Had miles transferred to another AA member and they said it would cost $77 which was fine. When they got to the airport AA then said I didn‚Äôt have enough miles even tho they had my seat reserved with miles and I had cancelled.
39,"I am writing this review because the experience that I have had with AmericanAirlines in the past two days is honestly unbelievable. My daughter is a minor and was flying back from Anchorage to Myrtle Beach on November 2, 2022. When she arrived at the airport for check in They sent her to the gate with the app on her cell phone for boarding. She is an unaccompanied minor which I paid extra for so you cannot use the app for boarding. That was their first mistake because by the time she went back to the desk she ended up missing her flight. Because of that she did not return to Myrtle Beach when she was supposed to. She had to be put on a flight for the next night which was extremely inconvenient especially because of her school. She then leaves Anchorage on the next flight which was the next night and when she arrives in Dallas she has no unaccompanied minor tag or chaperone. When I find this out I go straight to the Myrtle Beach airport to find out why my child is alone in Dallas. In the process she finds someone and ask about her chaperone  and she is told that she is not on a list for a chaperone. A lady sits with her anyway but tells her that she will probably not have a chaperone  when she gets to Charlotte. While I am at Myrtle Beach airport I find out that Anchorage airport put my child on the plane and did not list her as an unaccompanied minor so she was not chaperoned. I wasted my entire morning at Myrtle Beach airport trying to make sure that my child was safe and would make it back to Myrtle Beach because she still had another connecting flight. I am making this review to make anyone aware that has a minor child to possibly find another airline because this is the most unacceptable thing that I have ever had to deal with. I am extremely unhappy with this entire situation and I can say that if nothing else the one mistake that an airline should never make is not having a chaperone available for a minor that has three different flights. When booking this flight I was assured multiple times that my child would not be alone and that was not the case. Once again this whole situation has been absolutely unbelievable. I pray that no parent ever has to experience the stress that I have with this airline."
40,No customer service email address for enquiries regarding AAadvantage.
41,"Please do not fall for their marketing ""value of tickets never expire and you can make unlimited changes"". I found out my tickets expired in July this year when medical issue prevented me from using the ticket.  Do better, American Airlines. Taking my hard earned money and taking advantage. My choice will be to take my business somewhere else."
42,I am very satisfied and appreciative of the American ailines crew that assisted us on our entire journey from Honolulu to Heathrow London. ABIGAIL GRAY is her name and she had eased our  worries and stress.If all the crew is like her then i wud gladly confirm that your airline will be of a huge compliment.i am making these review to thank her so much.
43,Cannot check in onlineThe website is awful.  It wants you to download their App but you cannot if you do not have a US zip code.It would not let me select a passenger to check in. The WORST airline website ever. Even Ethiopian is better
44,"As a twelve year military veteran, I‚Äôve spent a significant amount of time on flights all over the world. In that time, I‚Äôve never felt the need to write a bad review until American Airlines. Prior to the start of the trip, we had to rebook multiple times and reschedule plans due to the airlines canceling flights and expecting us to deal with their total lack of organization via email and numerous phone calls.During our first flight home, they canceled our connecting flight three separate times. They ultimately rescheduled us for a flight that departs 25 hours later. Bear in mind, we had originally paid extra to get an early flight home and now we‚Äôre an entire day late. We spent 30 minutes attempting to locate any American Airline employees to help in the airport. We finally located the ‚ÄúAdmirals Club‚Äù (a club to supposedly help American Airlines guests) and asked for assistance switching the destination to a closer airport so we could rent a car with our own money and the guy refused to help us because we weren‚Äôt card members. Not only did he refuse to help us, but he proceeded to mock our circumstances and went as far as having the audacity to ask if we wanted to sign up for an American Airlines credit card because he would then, and only then, be able to assist us. If you want to pay thousands of dollars to be treated as if you don‚Äôt matter, American Airlines is the place for you. I‚Äôm going to happily spend the next 25 hours on every travel review website explaining just how our experience was, to hopefully advise other travelers to book elsewhere and help them avoid enduring this horrific experience. Flight Confirmation #: LDKKVA"
45,"Key West, Fantasy Fest weekend.  Trying to leave our flight is delayed 11 times,  flight #1925. AA claims it was weather related and no compensation. There are no rooms available anywhere due to 50,000 plus people hitting the small island this weekend. Looking out the window its bright clear and wonderful weather. Im confused. We were told we could take advantage of the complimentary lobby seating for our overnight stay and perhaps they could honor their travel commitments tomorrow. When I was younger the airlines were a special way to travel. Customers were treated as a valuable commodity.  Today they treat you as an inconvenience at best and with utter disdain most any other time. You are not a customer but a victim to their greed and incompetence. When a merchant sells you a product or service they either deliver or go out of business.  Not so the airlines and AA in particular.  They get propped up by banks and governments with no need to provide quality service for payment rendered.  I will drive 10,000 miles before I put my family and myself in their clutches ever again. You are nothing but cattle to America Airlines. Looking out the lobby window there is a bit of haze. Perhaps its from the crack they might be smoking at American Airlines."
46,"We spent almost 1 1/2 hours 100 ft from gate waiting to exit the plane at Baton Rouge BTR.  They said no gate was available, but I have a picture out the window showing there was an empty gate.  Pilot said there was bad weather in Dallas and that was contributing to the delay exiting in Baton Rouge.  They turned off the wifi and wouldn't turn it back on.  They could have pulled up mobile stairs and let us exit the plane that way.  If there had been an emergency on the plane, we would have all been off in 5 minutes, but they made us wait for 90 minutes!"
47,Rewards members treated poorly Thank you for being an awards member as it means absolutely nothingFlight cancellation announced at 10 minutes to boarding Customer service absolutely no help !!!!Place on flight to the dirtiest airport  Dallas where the bathrooms cannot be used to how bad they are Went from Charleston To Dallas to cleveland And yes wait for it Dallas to cleveland placed me last row next to the bathrooms that smelled as nice as Dallas Thank you american for ruining a vacation With absolutely no respect for your clients time. Health .....
48,"Never fly with American Airlines; Spirit or Frontier are so much better!8th Oct 2022, I was flying Pensacola, Florida to LAX with a connection in Charlotte, North Carolina.There was a maintenance detail leaving Pensacola which caused a missed connecting flight from Charlotte to LAX.Landed in Charlotte at 9.30pm and was told the next flight to LAX would be the next morning 7.10am. The Service desk suggested as there was such a short period of time between flights I should sleep somewhere in the airport. Mind you, there are no hotels in the airport complex.Firstly, it is a ridiculous suggestion to say a passenger sleep on the floor or a seat somewhere in the airport. Someone in front of me asked for a blanket and the service desk said ""We don't have those for offer."" At that hour all the airport shops were closed so noone could purchase a blanket.The cheapest hotel I could find within a 30min drive from the airport was $140USD.It wasn't until I put in my refund request a few days later I was told the ""agreed rate"" for a hotel refund in Charlotte was $101 dollars.On top of that, I missed one night of paid accommodation in LAX. They are not offering a refund for this.Instead I've been offered a $125 paper travel voucher which will be delivered to my Australian address in 6 weeks time and a lesser than full refund for a hotel I needed due to an airline fault.I've emailed consistently and gotten responses of ""you're a valued customer"" and ""we appreciate your feedback"" but no addressing my request of full refunds for the hotel and missed LA accommodation.Its been 3 weeks of handballing, sidestepping the issue and delayed email responses. Poor behaviour American Airlines. I'll never fly with you again, a budge airline has been customer service than you."
49,The lowest of low customer service.  I broke an ankle and they refused to issue a refund or reschedule.  No sympathy whatsoever.  Just greed.  Take your money elsewhere.
50,Oct 24  -  flight on AA Dfw to Boi.  Mechanical issue over utah and land at SLC around  1230 pm.   They then have to bring another plane / crew in which meant waiting around 8 hrs at airport or what I did rent a car and drove 4.5 hrs to boise from SLC.  Lucky I did not have checked bags.   Their CS solution.  Here is a $50 credit to future AA flight.  needless to say I won't fly AA again.  They can take their insulting $50 credit and gth.
51,This is the worst airlines of all the airlines. if you have to pay a little bit more money find another airline to work with...do it. They wouldn't let me get a boarding pass because my flight took off in 43 minutes which is 2 minutes past their 45 minute time frame. Completely ridiculous!!!
52,"We arrived at the airport in Houston on time, but we were informed that we had to wait at the tarmac for planes that were diverted from Dallas because of bad weather. We ended up waiting 3 hours on the tarmac!  When we were finally allowed to deplane, the bad weather had reached Houston, forcing us to have to get a hotel at the airport, given that the weather was bad enough that we could not dare drive for the 40 minutes it would take to get to our house in Conroe. The question is why were we displaced from our gate in favor of several planes that were diverted?  Why couldn‚Äôt they let us deplane while those planes waited on the tarmac?  Instead it was us who were supremely inconvenienced and forced to spend money on a hotel room for our safety. American Airlines should at the very least have offered to pay for hotel rooms. Frankly, it is unacceptable that we were the ones forced to wait for 3 hours!  There was zero explanation given as to why those planes were given priority. I will NEVER fly American again, ever!"
53,"Don‚Äôt, I only fly them because Alaska Airlines uses them to get me home where they don‚Äôt fly. Unreal how terrible they are, timelines are a joke, staff is very incompetent and they are genuinely the worst. Won‚Äôt be sad if they go out of business. Alaska is great but should connect with a better airline."
54,Horrible experience and unwillingly to accommodate for their delays
55,"AA oversold the flight, cancelled it and rebooked all passengers on a SMALLER plane. Make it make SENSE!!!Everybody was put in completely different seats, families with children were seperated and it was complete chaos."
56,"I flew from London to Charlotte  on 10/04/22, I was allocated a seat ( 40E ) at check in. When I boarded the flight attendant asked me to sit in seat 29C. A lady sat in 29A and her husband sat in my original seat (40E), I asked her husband if he wanted to sit in 29C but he declined.The lady in seat 29A was extremely unwell and coughed throughout the flight, it is obvious she had Covid and then I tested positive for covid.I know you can‚Äôt control viruses but why was I moved from my original seat to a seat that had obviously been allocated to man and wife who somehow managed to get their allocation changed and then I was in direct contact with with an infected person?AA‚Äôs actions put me in danger.They admit it was their ‚Äú cabin crew who made the switch‚ÄùI am aggrieved because I flew to USA to see my brother who has cancer and because of their actions I am not able to see him. I do not know if I will see him again.I approached AA for recompense suggesting an upgrade on my return flight or a refund for the original flight but they showed no sympathy whatsoever and merely said they reserve the right to move people at will. I sat alone in a caravan.AA displayed a total neglect for my safety and refused to explain their actions.There are better airlines."
57,"What a joke mainline American has become.  Don't bother paying for a First-class ticket because the only thing it gets you is a bigger seat.  The service is such a disappointment.  I traveled from RDU to CLT for the first part of my trip and during the flight at NO time did the two lead flight attendants offer anything to the first-class cabin.  Instead, they sat up front the whole flight and chatted.  They also brought full bottles of water to airline personnel that were traveling in the coach section who were non-reviving and heading home.Then they had the gaul to walk through the cabin and ask for garbage because they would be to lazy to clean the plane at the end of the trip. The discussion in frost class then became the lack of customer service that was happening.  I tried asking the gate agent the name of the flight attendants when i deplaned, but she refused to give them to me and told me to contact customer service. Please read the generate and canned response from American airlines.  This airline has become the joke in the aviation industry.  Then to top it off they want you to review the customer service agent begging for good reviews.  WHAT A JOKE!!!!AmericanAirlinesCustomerRelationsOctober 23, 2022Hello Ms. Thomas:Thank you for contacting American Airlines. We strive to put our customers at the center of everything we do.

58,"Worst airline, always delays, terrible communication, bad service"
59,"Very very poor service‚Ä¶.they were not clear about the Gate no. Update ,missed my flight..even though I reached the counter 10 mins early, after waiting at the last updated gate no. For 2hrs. They miss placed my bag and could not find it and took 2 hrs to find it and I missed my connecting flight. When I contacted the customer care they very rudely said it‚Äôs not their fault and that baggage missing issues is faced by many customers and they are not responsible for me missing my flight.very irresponsible,don‚Äôt care about customer satisfaction abd very rude. The customer care service is useless."
60,"American airlines has the worst customer service ever!!!On October 4th, my uncle could not travel due to health concerns. So he and his daughter/caregiver canceled their flight.  I submitted an email to the refund dept along with his doctor's note stating my uncle was not able to travel due to his health.  (He has cancer) Refund was denied and ticket credits were given to use before expiration date. So i spoke to a reservation agent requesting to extend the expiration of ticket credit from March 2023 to October 2023 because that's when my family will be having our annual trip. Also,  requested to have my uncle's ticket name changed to someone else since he is not able to travel according to his doctor.  The agent told me i had to email customer service my requests and someone will contact me where I can explain my situation.  I sent an email.  Customer service rep Karla Brue responded via email instead of calling me.  Her response did not contain a phone number to call.  She replied sympathetically in the beginning of the email,  however stated due to policy we are unable to fulfill your requests- extension and name change. I replied restating the reason for extension and name change for my uncle.  If AA will want my uncle to travel under his condition (against his doctor's wishes) and the airlines will be responsible if anything were to happen to him? She responded with they understand but again they are following policy. And next time we should purchase insurance protection like most businesses and corporations do when their people travel. I was not happy with that response! AA are the worst airlines! I will not recommend to book your flights with them.  I've never requested for anything like this. I work for the hotel industry and understand there are policies, however we have made exceptions to accommodate our guests in certain situations.  All we asked was to extend for few months later and one of the tickets to be transferable (name change) and they are not willing to bend.  Don't ever fly with American Airlines!!! Hawaiian airlines or Southwest are the way to go!"
61,Always late.. customer service is rude when trying to re-book a flight or figure out different connections.  Obviously American Airlines doesn‚Äôt care about their reputation.  Highly recommend using Delta!
62,"Just wanted to take the time to leave a positive note. Most people only leave reviews when they have something to complain about. However, I recently had to travel for my step dads funeral, and American was great about accommodating last minute changes.I bought the cheapest tickets you could buy that looked like they didn‚Äôt even have the option to change your flight, Both me and my boyfriend ended up needing to change our return date. I was able to change his through the app, with no issues. Mine I ended up changing the day before I was set to fly home. It was too late to make the change myself, but a very nice agent helped me over the phone with basically no hold times. They didn‚Äôt charge either of us anything extra for the changes. I also paid for exit row seats, but when I changed my boyfriends flights, the planes he ended up on didn‚Äôt even have an exit row, so I requested a refund via email which they sent, no questions asked. Also, I didn‚Äôt even tell anyone at any point that I was traveling for a funeral, they just did all this without any question. Overall, pretty great experience as far as flying goes. If American is available, I‚Äôll definitely pick them over any other airline."
63,"Worst company ever! Even checking in is a nightmare, cannot do it without an account. Appalling service."
64,"The AA agents in Tallahassee saved the day,week, my whole trip.  They did everything possible to get us on the trip of a lifetime when all odds were against us.  I'm truly grateful for their extraordinary efforts.  5 stars ladies!!  Thank you!!!"
65,I have never traveled with any airline that doesn't provide food on 10h flight! My flight was at 9 30 am the gave us lunch at 11 (pasta and cheese) super early I felt like they want to get that done asap so they can relax. Then the dinner was served 30min before landing and after 10h they gave us a bun just a 1 small roll! This is truly unacceptable.on the way back the food wasn't great again some pasta in BBQ sauce. And after 10 h of flying due to some small turbulence we didn't even got a coffee nor a food.
66,Unhelpful person directing to check in - excellent check in lady - poor food and choice - awful wine - no customer ‚Äòservice‚Äô - off hand staff attitude- no checks on seat belts secured etc.
67,"Will never travel with these again staff very rude and they cancelled my connecting flight while I was in mid-air so left me stranded at airport for nearly 20 hours before I could get another flight. I missed my embarkation of my cruise and had to get a flight to the cruise first port to pick it up. On top of this they lost my baggage so had no clothes or anything they told me to buy some clothes and they would reimbursees' me, but they had not. One of the worse airlines around and I travel a lot using different airline so will stay well away from these have already cancelled two holidays as I was using these so have booked again but with another airline."
68,Thank you American airlines for keeping us safe on our travels not allowing pilots to fly any aircraft that oppose any issue I took flight from Indianapolis going to Charlotte I was delayed for my connection flight to Charlotte American airlines make sure that me and my 6-year-old kid had somewhere safe to sleep and food to eat thank you for a wonderful experience I truly appreciate it I don't know what I would have done probably sleep at the airport until my flight tomorrow I appreciate it
69,I would give zero stars if that was an option but American Airlines is the worst airlines ever. So rude wouldn‚Äôt let me into lounge at Boston after promising I could. Most useless credit card ever and such a waste
70,"Horrible, horrible, horrible‚Ä¶ so many of the flights are late, late, late. You miss your connection they don‚Äôt care. Your luggage gets sent on another flight a different flight!We changed to a later flight in the day they charge me $181 to change to a different flight! Same destinations, same originating city I was flying out of.  Then I had to end up paying $25 per seat because all the free seats were gone!!! SCAM !!!!! Never again. Plus, they will never give you your money back on the ticket they always stick you with a credit. I don‚Äôt want a credit I want my money back!!!!!!"
71,Worst customer service and reliability of any major airline.
72,"Booked seats 38A and 38C When we got our tickets at the airport found out we got 34C and 34B When pointed out the mistake was told could do nothing. Once on the plane asked member of crew can we move to empty seats. was told would sort it out. we never got moved. The crew where rude, Dont use AA they dont give a s%&t about you"
73,"Writing this revue, a month after our flight. I‚Äôd need time to calm down. I booked the one-way flight from Nashville (BNA) to Vancouver BC. (YVR) for September 11, 2022, on November 27, 2021. A full eleven before departure!! I‚Äôd paid up for First/Business Class. This was part of our Anniversary trip. Return trip was one way from Calgary (YYC) back to Nashville (BNA). FYI: it was least expensive than booking round trip.    The original flight was Nashville to Chicago, then onward to Vancouver via Air Canada. During the early part of 2022, American Airlines and Air Canada parted ways, (Oneworld Alliance). So, getting this reschedule was not fun. The computer system re-booked us automatically but with only 25 minutes between flights. Trying to get from a national terminal to an international terminal in 25 minutes is NOT going to work.   So, I called AA Customer Service and got through in a timely fashion, wow! The rep Chad was helpful and got us re-booked thru Dallas/Ft. Worth. So now we are going to Nashville to Dallas to Vancouver with a 2-hour layover. Nice!   About 2 weeks or so later I received an email from AA nothing a change to my flight from Dallas to Vancouver and that my seats were chained!?!? I was somehow bump/move from first class to main cabin on the second legged of our trip. (From 2 D, F to 10 E, F) So I called right away. A rep did a lot of research and spent 35 to 40 minutes with me. She believed that the flight (First Class) may have been sold out before the re-booking or*** that an AAdvantage member, Platinum status, Loyalty, miles, etc. tends to get first choice. She let on more than she should have. So much for booking early.   I call many times to get my seats moved back to first class but on luck. The day of our flight I talk to the gate agent, and she was not showing any First-Class seat available. When boarding the aircraft, I ask for the Purser and that I did to talk to her ASAP. She came to our seats, and I told her about the above situation. She said she would be back before push-back and if there are any seats in first that we may have them. There was only one and I offer it to my wife. She declines saying if we both cannot go that she would stay here. The Purser did let us know that we were/could get a refund for the difference once our flight was completed. Good to know.   We did get a refund of $327. We paid $1197 less the $327 equal $870 so it all work out, kinda.Overall, the flight left about 5 minutes early and arrived 15 minutes early, too. Did miss our meals but we got snacks!! (sarcasm) The flight crew was really good, and the aircraft was clean, Boeing 737-800. Note: we could not connect to the free Wi-Fi, but I downloaded a few movies to my laptop. It's a shame that a once great airline has become an over price budget airline,Just disappointed that we did not get what we paid for up front. I‚Äôll get over it one day, maybe..."
74,"I got a R/T ticket from 9/29 to 10/2 from Rochester to Orlando, all the flights were canceled by the company. I was told that I will get a refund of $750, received only $410. I called today and an agent called Jose very rapidly a rough said after I explained all the case that he doesn't do that research and I have to send an email to check on that. This person shouldn't be a customer representative because he doesn't help in anyway and even more his attitude was very bad. No more flights with AA, very bad service in all the ways."
75,"I won‚Äôt bore with the details. The story of incompetence, rudeness, and layovers due to overbooking and canceled flights is too long. Just know that overall, AA is a horrible airline to fly if you actually have a schedule to make. If you do decide to give AA a chance, plan ahead because your booking will most likely cancel and they‚Äôll reply with zero sympathy or assistance and then tell you you‚Äôve been rescheduled for a flight that leaves in TWO DAYS!!! They are absolutely horrible!"
76,"As awful as the majority say. A delay with their catering caused me to be removed from my connection (also American). They first claimed I caught it, then decided I didn‚Äôt warrant a refund, and finally just ignored the evidence. They will write you standard emails telling you how much they care but they simply don‚Äôt do anything. If other businesses acted like this they wouldn‚Äôt be trading for long but their position in the market seems to foster a couldn‚Äôt care attitude. They make BA‚Äôs transatlantic service seem amazing. Avoid wherever possible."
77,"I'm a disabled veteran and I purchased a ticket but had to cancel within 24 hours.  I was told twice that I would receive a refund by online chat and customer service.   Now, I m given a flight credit.   VETERANS AND DISABLED VETERANS DO NOT FLY WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES.   THEY DONT RESPECT VETERANS"
78,"Flying to JFK with British Airways (I will be writing a very positive review)Checking in : Nothing too much of a problem, can check in extra bags above what we had paid for - (which were much lighter than the allowance BTW) - excellent polite service from the front desk, polite pleasant etc - no queues + efficientFlying from JFK with American Airlines:Queues and slow to processUnfriendly check in staff, everything a problemCould not check in extra paid for baggage (though our documentation showed we had paid for etc. etc.Some companies just dont get customer service do they ?"
79,Spent about 3 hours in the plane only to get told 3 different excuses 1.) the smoke detector was broken 2.) the weights and balances were ‚Äúoff‚Äù and then 3.) the pilots were now timed out because of the 3 hour delay and a new crew was called in. The flight was delayedt by 8 HOURS.. every hour they kept saying that it will be one more hour‚Ä¶ egregious service..
80,"I booked a flight back from Monterey to Norfolk. In Monterey our flight was delayed because of ""paperwork problems"". My connecting flight was rebooked for the next morning which caused a delay of 13 hours. In Dallas (my layover) I called AA and received a hotel voucher. However, no hotels were available so the voucher was useless. I had to keep calling back to find the ""status"" of my request for a hotel. I received a food voucher after having to beg for it on the hotline but all food venues were closed by that time. To add insult to injury, AA sent me a $50 credit for my next flight with them. This is a disgrace and an embarrassment to the company. They clearly do not care about their customers."
81,"America Airlines allowed a possible terrorist to steal 30,ooo miles and use it to book travel from Bangladesh to Dubai with my miles.  They did not reimburse my miles however they did verify they were stolen and used in the middle east while I am in the USNow I have lost my status because my miles were stolen and AA is doing nothing to rehabilitate my miles and or status.  they are also not working with US authorities to capture and prosecute the criminalsThey have dumped all responsibility into the travelers hands,We all my have better luck with another US carrier like United who seem to value travelers safety and status more"
82,"Always had nice experience with them, although a bit pricey lately"
83,"In March 2020, we were planning a tour of Ireland and then going on to Scotland via American Airlines.  Suitcases were packed and we were flying out with our daughter from Wyoming and meeting our son from Colorado in Ireland, a trip of a lifetime.  Then, Covid hit and our trip was postponed.  We were disappointed, but made a new plan for 2022. Our travel agent was able to rebook our tickets and we thought we were set.However, covid prevailed and our tour company again made the decision to wait.  So here it is time to get tickets for 2023 and that is where we hit a huge snag.  American Airlines refused to book us a ticket for 2023.  We were told that tickets must be issued by September 30th and must be used by December 31st, 2022, no exceptions.  Since out tour is April of 2023, it is not a plausible plan for us.We have tried to talk to American Airlines, but they say policy is policy.  That is fine, but give us our money back.  How can American Airlines just keep over $4000.00 of our money because of policy for no service rendered?  Our son is the lucky one, he booked with United Airlines.  No problem, they are happy to accommodate.  We, however, have hit closed doors and feel cheated and mystified by American Airlines.  My advice to everyone, do not fly American Airlines.  They cause only disappointment and stress."

I dont think ive ever had such a bad flight in all my years of travelling.I will prefix this complaint by stating that my wife and I BOTH have credit cards with American Airlines and we take flights with American Airlines often. One such very for example: WJUPDL... However, my complaint lies with YBDRGRMy entertainment system didnt work for starters. So I asked for help. The flight attendant told you, you wont believe it, she told me they will fix it for me in Bogota. So when I get off the plane, never to return on the same place, I am satisfied that its fixed for somebody else. Really??? Is this how you train your staff?Next, the same flight attendant kept bashing my knee with the cart. Not only that, she acknowledged doing it but didnt say anything at all. Do you pay your staff enough, or is this a training issue? I dont remember her name, but she was a larger black lady.The bigger problem was later when I pushed my service button. The lady came over and turned it off, then walked away. So I put it back on, she did the same thing. I repeated this FOUR times until I finally snapped and told her why she keeps turning it off and NOT acknowledging me!?! She said 'They turn on by themselves'. Yeah bulls***. She CLEARLY doesnt want to work, for whatever reason. I do not know why or what the reason is, but this really made me mad. I purpose booked with a different airlines for my next two trips because I was so madI want you to make this right because i dont accept this as situatable customer service nor aircraft maintenance.If I dont hear a suitable resolution, I will cancel my credit cards and use a different airlines moving forwards."
85,"American gave us flight credit for a cancellation.  Their website stated it was good for a year, but when we tried to redeem it seven months later they said it was no good, ‚ÄúCompany policy had changed‚Äù.  Each employee gave a different answer and none of them lined up with their website or the email they had provided.  Essentially and organized group of thieves."
86,"Really bad service. This was a code share with British Airways which I booked on the same ticket & flew British Airways on the way out. BA allowed me to check a bag and choose a seat for my flight once I checked in without issue. AA failed to let me check my bag or choose a seat at all, although they admitted that it made no sense that my ticket had allowed me to check my bag in on the way to the USA. They were unwilling to do anything to help. I was particularly disgusted with the behaviour of Auerlie Noinville (based in Liverpool) who was not only extremely unhelpful and left me in a distressing and disgraceful situation, but proceeded to laugh at my predicament twice during our call which was very disrespectful. Her manager Ruan was completely useless. They convey being a credible airline but in fact worse than Ryanair who at least acknowledge that they are a bargain basement airline. AA are not fit to be transatlantic carriers. On board, the service was far poorer than BA. It has tighter seating, shorter seatbelts (unsuitable if you are a bit overweight) & the entire flight was extremely cold with the stewards switching the aircon back on because they were hot despite the fact that our entire row was freezing & covered in jumpers and blankets to try and keep off the cold. I would seriously avoid this airline going forward if I can."
87,"I have purchased tickets from NY to IL, however for some conditions, I had to go to IL earlier than I planned, I wanted to change my ticket dates even if I would be charged extra money and then I find out that I cannot make any changes nor I cancel it, even if I would do so, they said that they will not return any amount of my money for cancellation. After I have read the reviews that have been left before me on Trustpilot and App Store, now I‚Äòm üíØ sure that I‚Äôm not gonna use this company‚Äôs any kind of service in the future."
88,This is the worst airline to flight with. El servicio de CVG EL PEOR .
89,"My wife purchased a ticket to Buenos Aires for a conference. Flight was delayed 3 days. She missed the conference as a result, loss another $500 in hotel reservation. As an effort to make it right, American Airlines offered me $50 off on my next flight. No trip credit. No refund. No Vaseline. I'm done with AA. NEVER AGAIN."
90,Our flight was delayed in departure and disembarking causing us to miss our connecting flight. AA rebooked us on a new flight but this when we tried to check in  there was no record of this so we had to buy tickets and they won‚Äôt refund us.
91,"Very disappointed in your service level and lack of customer empathy. I can now see why Delta is a market leader in the airline business.  I put in a request on the 22nd of Sept and received a response 9 days later (1-31968207200). Not only were your agents rude over the phone, but so was your customer-compliant automated system. My aged mother who is already nervous to fly at her age will be disappointed to hear that I can not fly along her side in first-class. It is a 4-hour flight.You may be able to hide behind your fine print for economy class purchase, but we will remember. You have a buyer-beware policy that is unbreakable and you make no exceptions for any type of upgrade when you purchase a ""lower- class"" ticket."
92,I paid round trip Phoenix to Bangkok.  I could NEVER reach anyone to get an e-ticket home. I called and spent a total of about 8 hours on hold.  I tried for a refund & they said I didn't show up in Bangkok.  American partners with Japan Air üíï & the nice ladies at Japan Air said they have this problem ALL THE TIME with American.  I bought a new ticket home thru Japan Air. NEVER EVER AGAIN WILL I USE THIS POOR EXCUSE FOR AN AIRLINE!!!!!!!
93,"My review below was scathing because of copy & paste responses which ignored my request. Not giving up, someone finally took action and the response was superb. Kerry Morgan, a professional and responsive customer service person, phoned me and sorted everything out. True quality service.Awfully difficult to get through to Cust Relations. Finally got am email in and the response was meaningless drivel about ""World class cust service"". They completely ignored what I asked for. I believe they didn't bother to read the email just responded with a copy paste to hit some target. AA's target should aim to improve to be ""A 3RD WORLD CUSTOMER SERVICE"""
94,"Booked a 0900 flight to Orlando in Dec 2022 (mind you this was early Sept 2022).  In a two week span (still in Sept), my family's flight (there are 7 of us), we have had our flight changed twice first to a 0700 flight then again to a 0615 flight.  Both times calling the airline speaking to VERY rude, disrespectful, and non-compassionate people that basically stated that we deal with the changes or move our flight to a later time and hope it doesn't get moved or cancelled again.  Telling the individuals on the phone this doesn't work for my family since we have reservations and we need to make sure we get to them and not be stranded can we be issued a refund so we can make other plans, comment was NO, since our tickets were non-refundable we would get a credit, what good is a credit going to do if I have to buy tickets from another airline.  No concern, American Airlines sucker punches there customers, and if we choose to get non-refundable and request refund due to their scheduling or their cancellations customers get screwed.  Also, don't waste money on getting flight insurance, that was an extra waste of money because alliance doesn't do anything either.  Very disappointed and will do everything I can to NEVER fly American Airlines again (would much rather fly spirit -- pay for crappie service, you expect crappie service)."
95,"Wow, just wow. My name is Justin Campbell. I'm positive I'm in your database. I gave you my real name so maybe you could call me and tell me you've made EVERYTHING like no gate or gate number on my ticket to a professional (? I know you guys are short on them.) pilot boarding our plane to move 15 feet and a grown man had a panic attack so we pulled 15 feet back in to let him off and woop de effin doo that was all the pilot had time for because they can only fly so long. So you're telling me if he was in the air he'd have to parachute out and say ""sorry, I'm out, even though I've already broken several laws, like flying a plane when youre not technically even supposed to"" You guys are one step closer to spirit and frontier. Good luck. And most of your flight attendants could give a crap less. We're cattle to you.To big to fail pos. I'd rather die on spirit then ever fly this company again. Sat on 3 different planes for at least 2 and a half hours. In short do better. I know you won't though because you don't care! You SUCK!"
96,"This airline no longer offers online checkin for UK residents flying to the US. First, they require you to upload covid vaccination documents through their mobile app. God only knows why there is no option to upload a document from a laptop. Every other part of the checkin process can be done from a laptop, but not this one. Nor do they tell you it cannot be done on a laptop when you make the booking or when you begin checkin. Second, the app will not recognise UK international covid passports - either the paper version or the digital versions from the NHS app. Without their app recognising your covid passport you are not allowed to check in. As a result it is impossible to check in prior to arrival at the airport. Given the queues at Heathrow, Manchester etc in recent months this is a recipe for missing one's flight. I didn't have any of these issues when flying from the UK to the US with Virgin last month. But American Airlines has clearly adopted inadequate software that doesn't work with laptops and doesn't work with the format of UK government's international vaccine passports. A complete nightmare to deal with. Avoid at all costs!"
97,I had the worst experience EVER with the customer service team at AA - sent 2 complaint emails and spent hours on the phone to people each telling me a different thing. This was ongoing for weeks. The only reason why I‚Äôm giving 3 stars instead of 0 is because at the end of this nightmare I spoke to Amanpreet who managed to help me and was amazing!!!! Thank you Amanpreet and bless you‚Ä¶
98,"AA Complaint number: 14699825001Iberia complaint number: Re: C√≥digo de expediente: P20220919-29248080Abuse and mistreatment against autistic youth by Iberia and authorities at Barajas airport, Madrid, Spain.We bought the ticket with American Airlines, we did not choose Iberia, since in the past we have had bad experiences with this company, AA did not gave my son alternative; therefore you are part of the problem and AA have to cover the errors  made by this company because is as responsable as them, Iberia refunded the extra 200.00‚Ç¨, that they charged him for an error made by them, but for my son, had to stay in Madrid and spend a day and a half on a hotel; pay transportation and food as a result of these errors and Iberia and AA have to compensate him for those expenses. American Airlines should at least refund of the price of the ticket, we have already communicated with Iberia and filled a claim in the BBB and the DOT; we have not included American Airlines but if you are not part of the solution, we will have to look through the organizations that  correspond and not let the whole world look to the side after the terrible consequences caused by these incidents of September 17.We spoke with Michael Blade and wrote her 3 emails at but we don‚Äôt get and answer yet."
99,"After years of disliking AA because for poor customer service on every level, I now have another HUGE reason NEVER to fly them again!  My husband and I are currently scheduled to fly out of Orlando tomorrow morning.  Because of hurricane Ian, and the likelihood of the airport being closed tomorrow, we phoned AA to see about changing our flight to today, or to fly out of another regional airport.  There was one flight out of Melbourne, but AA declared they would charge us an additional $785 for us to change our flight.  My husband flys across the country each week, thus has status with AA (not that that actually means something anymore), but still not enough to warrant decent customer service, or prevent AA from extorting its loyal customers!!  I fly Delta and United (have status with both) and this just reinforces my preference.  Now my husband finally decided to boycott American Airlines too!!!   American Airlines does not care about its customers‚Ä¶ their actions and poor customer service demonstrate nothing else!"
100,"My family and I recently flew to New York with BA & returned with American Airlines. My 19 year old son has a nut allergy and some years ago he nearly died from eating cashew nuts. I contacted BA (both flights were booked through them) before the flight and was told to mention it on day of flying. The British Airways staff were excellent and put our mind at ease. We were allowed to pick our seats together & the staff confirmed BA does not have nuts in their meals and even gave a ""polite notice"" that one passenger had a nut allergy on the flight and requested other passengers please refrain from eating nuts.However, on our return from New York we had to use American Airlines. Having got to the airport nearly 4 hours in advance we were then informed we would not be sitting together (despite having enough seats available). The member of staff at check-in said the seats are allocated at random by the computer and not by staff and if we wanted to change our seats we'd need to pay $69 for each seat change. After 30 mins of arguing with a manager that my son could have an anaphylactic fit and needed us around to administer an epi-pen we were given seats together & told ""we won't do this again"". They did admit that this complaint is common and it is not known why American Airlines allocate seats this way.  However, I believe it is simply a money-making exercise.They added that A.A. did not have nuts on board flights and we should speak to flight attendants regarding making an ""polite notice"" about nuts. On boarding the flight the attendants refused to give this warning over the intercom, citing ""American Airlines could make themselves liable if they made announcement"". I disagreed, saying British Airways were happy to do it & having brought it to their attention I felt they were now liable as they had ignored my warning, but they simply said ""we are not British Airways"". Bizarrely, the member of staff asked where I was sitting and said he'd speak to the people around me. However, I pointed out that it was odd he had refused to speak to all passengers but was happy to some passengers. Also, considering air in a plane is recycled this needed to be addressed with the entire plane. Despite requests during the flight the attendant never spoke to anyone around us.    Later in the flight the flight attendants handed out meals, but they were not aware of any of the ingredients in the meals. This seemed odd as in the UK we are obliged to list ingredients. Having refused meals on our 8 hour journey we were then amazed when the staff proceeded to hand out nuts to every passenger. This bag contained cashew, pecan and walnuts. As nearly everyone in the plane ate nuts my son had an anxiety attack. I addressed this with the staff (who by now were well aware of his nut allergy) and I was bluntly told ""what can we do - we've handed them out now. This conversation is over. We'll just have to deal with it. You should have asked about nuts before boarding"". I did address this before boarding and was informed no nuts were served on the flight. They even continued serving nuts after I'd brought it to their attention. My son wore 2 facemasks during the entire flight from New York to London and fortunately did not suffer an anaphylactic shock. Since coming home I‚Äôve seen reports of other people with nut allergies being thrown off flights."
101,"They are the absolute worst! May as well be spirit airline but with higher prices. At least with spirit, you get what you pay for. The representatives on the phone to help or lovely but so sad they can‚Äôt even help and have no voice or Power. American rips people off and does not care about their customers"
102,"Been stuck on a plane at the gate for 2 1/2 hours. Just tell the truth.  Our co pilot was a no show or sick.  Keep telling us the co pilot is in the airport, the airport is not that big .  Then flight is cancelled for 5 hrs, line to get a hotel is over 2 hrs long. Then the flight changes from 5am to 6:30. I am a dedicated AA flyer, and have never been treated so bad. Gate staff is rude, we know it‚Äôs not their fault, but being rude is so wrong.  Sleeping in a chair for 5 hrs now. Make this right"
103,"This is the worst airline I have ever been on. My fianc√©, now husband, booked flights to go to Madrid we paid 300 dollars EACH to reserved seats. Get the the airport and we are not sitting together for our HONEYMOON!! We paid so much money for these tickets and then they made us check our carry on bags! Plus they made us get Covid testing when not one website said we needed it! This is the worst experience I have ever had and will NEVER book again with this company. This is not the first time that I had a horrible experience. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS AIRLINE! THEY DO NOT EVEN GIVE YOUR MONEY BACK IF YOU ‚ÄúRESERVED‚Äù YOUR FLIGHT FOR HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS!"
104,"I am an Platinum Exec elite traveler on American Airlines and my patience is running thin. Consistently late, equipment issues, poor customer service.  Literally EVERY FLIGHT I have taken in 2022 has had an issue that has made travel on AA unbearable.  Avoid until they get back to their values, flying planes on time."
105,"I wanted to book and pay for our seats to sit together and was not able to, as they only accept American cards‚Ä¶i was trying to get the seats due to the chat, but same problem there, I was advised to do the check in on the airport and ask to sit together there but of course there were no more seats together. This is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable!!! I am not flying with this company anymore!"
106,"My luggage didn't show up when I arrived at the airport. I filed an incident immediately and was told my bag would be there by 5 as it was on a flight to a different city. Once it arrives they would deliver. It's been 24 hours no bag. They will not tell me where my bag is, they will not refund me, nor will they provide a direct line where I reach out since I've received no updates. I've heard Delta is much better at taking care of their customers. Will probably switch."
107,I booked American and they put me on their partner airline JetBlue. If there‚Äôs a drop of rain JetBlue forgets how to operate an airline. I am AA Elite and didn‚Äôt get the AA Elite treatment. Had to wait in the security line for 30 mins. Very disappointed!
108,"I had a flight from NYC to London, they have on boarded everyone to the plane than they have announced that pilot didnot show up and we have to go out from plane and come back 8 hours later.. I am flying very frequantly and first time experience that pilot now showing up for the flight."
109,"they used to bu good in their mileage program, now it is the worst, so decided to cancel my credit card from them. poor customer service, policy has changed a lot. flight changes more often.  it is getting worst. I would not recommend, United has a better policy when it comes to their mileage. and ticketing services, customer services as well, they always have a direct flight."
110,"I have submitted my share of 1-star reviews for American Airlines in regards to bad customer service, especially when it relates to 1st class/Business accommodations (which is how I usually prefer to fly).  However, I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of requesting a refund (instead of a credit) for a non-refundable ticket.    Issue:  I had purchased a 1st class ticket for a family member who suddenly became unable to attend--personal issues regarding her child.  And it would be many years before she would be able to fly.  Therefore airline credit would be of no use to her. So, she requested a refund. It took a little effort to find the right portal on AA.com.  You have to scroll all the way down to the bottom of the screen to ""receipts and refund"".Other than that, the process was extremely simple.  Insert your ticket #.  A drop box presents 4-5 very general options of why you are requesting a refund for a non-refundable ticket. After picking the one that best suits your situation, then you state, in limited characters (approximately 2-3 short sentences), why you are requesting a refund.  My daughter was initially irritated by the lack of opportunity to present her ""essay"" on why she wanted and deserved a refund instead of credit.  However, we can now see the wisdom in limiting the characters in order to get to the main request. ""Just the facts ma'ame, just the facts!""Likewise, you have the opportunity to submit only 2 documents--supporting the given reason & document showing the relationship (if applicable). The size of each document could be no bigger than a 1-page pdf.  The process forces the requester to give only information to support the request--and nothing more.  In under 10 days, a favorable decision was received, and a couple of days later the money was refunded. Throughout the process, we were able to check back to see the status.  When the decision was made, we were promptly notified via email. The process was easy, transparent, and quick.  I appreciate that."
111,Most disorganized and very rude staffFirst time flyer with this companyI can say it was like a free for all when boarding to LondonLetting anyone sit where they wantedTurned into chaosStaff just didn't careFood was disgustingNever again!
112,"Worst experience ever! I do not recommend to get your ticket from this company. So stressful!I am very unsatisfied with this company service. I booked a flight from LA to Philadelphia for 26th July about 7 pm. There was one stop in Las Vegas for 1.5 HR. We got our boarding passes for both flights and got into the first flight in LA but when in Las Vegas received the email that second flight was canceled. The American airline representative offered a flight about 14 hrs later( literally the next day). I could not accept that since we had an event on Philadelphia the next morning and we had no place to stay for 14 hours!!  Eventually we were pursaded to get another flight to NY so we hopefully can get to Philadelphia on time. But rental car and hotel fee was not refunded as we made to change the location in the last minutes. We spent a good stressful amount of time in airport to find a flight and had hard time to get a new reservation for rental car. I asked for at least compensation from this disorganization. After few weeked of email back and forth, customer relation did not accept to compensate anything!!"
113,"I flew with American Airlines in late July. I was coming home (Minneapolis) from a wedding in Buffalo. I had a layover in Chicago. I checked my flight information before getting to the airport. I had already been delayed by two hours. These things happen. I understand that. I went to the Buffalo airport to talk about my options. They told me they could get me to Chicago that night, give me a hotel voucher then fly me to D.C. in the morning then back to Minneapolis. I agreed. I waited and kept getting delayed for the Chicago flight. As I was getting ready to board, I checked my email. American canceled my hotel voucher. I went to the desk to figure out what was going on. The guy tried his best but couldn‚Äôt get his computer to do what we needed. I was told to get on the flight and they would fix it in Chicago. When I landed at O‚ÄôHare, I was directed to the wrong gate for help three times. When I finally found the correct and open help desk, they had to pull a manager in to figure out the computer. They printed a new hotel voucher and told me I was set. I started walking towards the bus area and decided to call the hotel to make sure everything was good. The hotel had no record of me or my voucher. At this point, enough time had passed that if I left to try to get a hotel room on my own, I‚Äôd only have about an hour to try to sleep before getting up and trying to get back to the airport and get through security again. It wasn‚Äôt worth it. I had to stay in the airport all night until I could get on my first flight home. I have never been so disappointed while flying. I reached out to American Airlines to talk about my experience. They offered me a $125 voucher for another flight. I do not believe this was worth what I went through. I do not plan to travel with them again."
114,Worst experience ever!I bought a business class ticket from Phoenix to London.  American Airlines canceled my flight and put me on another flight 24h later on evonomy class !! They even gave an invalid meal voulcher. Nobody at American Airlines desks were helpful. They just did not caf√© and answered the story was closed!!
115,"AA cancelled my daughters flight that I paid for, then rescheduled for the next day.  I had to fly out that day I had an event I need to attend.  Their change in schedule did NOT work. We had the option to cancel  the ticket and requested a refund.  Now they refuse to refund the ticket they cancelled.  AA thinks they can just change schedules and it doesn't matter. There is a reason we booked a ticket that day and moving it to the next day doesn't work. I expect a full refund for my ticket that AA cancelled. Ticket #0017818699501 $237.10 Refund the full amount, instead of scamming your customers. AA should be penalized for cancelling tickets, they are making millions on cancelled tickets they are not refunding, by inconveniencing passengers."
116,"I purchased a ticket for a trip to Alaska with flight ins, however I came down with Covid.  They did not refund my ticket amount.  I feel that this was out of my control and felt some refund should have been given.  The world is changing everyday and not for the better."
117,"I would never travel with American Airlines again. I charge me for a carry on bag that I always use as carry on. I was charged $100. I received no satisfaction, everyone of the workers said that I have to email the company. I plan to go very far with this. What a way to treat your customers!!"
118,"We have used a travel agent for our trip to the USA and AA have cancelled the flights already twice since we booked in May due to fly in October. We booked extra legroom for three adults after the first cancellation on the return trip, when we went to rebook extra leg space after we received the refund the price has gone up by over ¬£200. We tired complaining to the travel agent but no success so we went straight to AA asking to justify why they have hiked the prices by so much and if they would honour the price we paid originally but all we got was an email with a standard template reply. We will reserve full judgement until after we have flown but are not happy in AA cancelling flights and raising prices substantially with not justifiable reason to the customer."
119,"Remains the cattle car of the skies: rude, arrogant employees who seem to just hate people from other countries.  Told our daughter, at the boarding gate,  that she could not fly back to her home country because entree law had changed in that country that day!  She has dual citizenship. AA informed her download an app and fill out personal info with a photo at the gate using her phone.  Told her that until she cleared that country's security check, she was not allowed onboard.  The plane was boarding now.  At the very last minute she was allowed on, however the clearance had not come through.  Her luggage however was not on the plane.  Our daughter would have been stranded at a major hub hundreds of miles from us.  The point here is that our daughter had contacted the embassy 4 days prior to flying and asked questions about this law change.  The embassy told her it had no bearing on citizens already abroad.  When she finally landed, the immigration people in her home country never mentioned it.  Misinformed arrogant AA employees seem to be AA's stock in trade.  She was treated terribly and was demeaned personally.  We actually tried to speak with a gate agent on her behalf and they would not take the call.  I reported to the airport managers office.  Our daughter has been waiting well over a week for her luggage to appear.  AA has told her that it keeps cycling from the hub to the coast and back again."
120,I checked in the day before online. When I got to the airport they kept me waiting in line so long the lady told me it was to late to put my bags on the plane. Mind you they used this excuse with SEVERAL ppl that day. Clearly they over booked the flight and used that excuse. So of course they had to rebook my flight. It was a guy in the airport sick and just my luck he sits beside me on the plane. Now guess who has COVID in the house. I‚Äôm so beyond ANGRY with AA.
121,"I absolutely love this company they  helped me out so much. I had booked with Thomas Cook because they were NOT helpful, I couldn‚Äôt get hold of them for weeks on end And when I did the advice was the wrong advice I was at my wits end and decided to to go through to the airline directly which was American Airlines. They was absolutely fantastic, they helped me out with all my queries  very quickly and told me what I needed to do ( saved my so much stress)  I‚Äôm still waiting for Thomas Cook to get back to me regarding my issues and I have just got back off holiday!! . When  did fly out with the AA staff were so lovely.. love the aeroplane and the food was gorgeous too .I would definitely fly AA again. Thank you to all"
122,"Horrible experience, rude employees, never again."
123,"I used to like AA, but over the years their service has fallen off a cliff. I was flying NYC to Guayaquil, Ecuador with a brief overnight layover in MIA. I had a carry on bag with everything I needed for my overnight stay in MIA. Clothes for the next day‚Äôs flight, toiletries, medicines, everything I needed. As I‚Äôm going through the gate, they tell me the flight is full and I must check my bag. I told them I need the items in it and the AA employees GUARANTEED me I‚Äôd be able to grab my bag in MIA. Ok fine, I trust their word. I get on the flight, and right above my seat is a completely empty overhead bin. Annoying, but ok I can grab my bag in MIA. When I get to Miami, I go to the baggage office for AA and let them know I need my bag and per the AA employees in NYC, I can grab it here. The MIA employees were astonished that I was told that, and they told me there was no way I could get that bag. It‚Äôs already packed for Ecuador the next day.Next day I had to buy a change of clothes, over the counter medicines, and toiletries at the airport to compensate for AA‚Äôs terrible service. And do you think customer service owned up to this and made this right? Of course not. This was a Spirit Air quality experience, from what‚Äôs meant to be one of the better airlines. Side note, my friend was flying down from MIA to Ecuador the next day, and his flight got canceled due to ‚Äúpolitics unrest‚Äù in the country, but my father in law‚Äôs flight (with Spirit Air), took off no problem. I‚Äôm avoiding AA at all costs from here on out."
124,"Avatar, Nadine, Jhamo, and Kam went above and beyond making our trip from London to Phoenix amazing. It originally was a disaster coming from Naples to London, but after an unexpected overnight stay, this team worked together to get our original seats back and my suitcase brought up ao I could take my much needed medication. Thank you to all.of you! Your kindness and extra efforts were greatly appreciated.  Kindly,Lisa & Ariella"
125,"Terrible, horrible, horrendous are a few accurate adjectives to describe customer service for American airlines.Book a ticket at your own risk, fight tooth and nail when they change your flight without notice! Forget about your flight credits they won't be there when you rebook. Thinking about calling to make your flights easier? Don't, that's how they created this mess. Glad we checked the app before departure otherwise we would have been stuck at the airport for 22hrs after our wedding. But as per customer service its our problem and ours alone!"
126,"I have been a long-time American Airlines customer and today has probably been the worse experience I have ever had with customer service. I tried to use my Grandmother's flight credit for her upcoming flight since she was initially sick during her originally scheduled flight (no issues getting the credit). But when I went to use the credit for a ""lesser"" ticket they wouldn't let me process it, forcing us to have to upgrade our ticket's main cabin. The amount was pretty small, but the fact they refused to just let us use the credit for a worse ticket than what we originally bought just goes to show they don't care about their customers at all and only car about squeezing every last $ out of us. I can't say I won't ever fly American again, but if I have the choice between them and basically any other Airline for about the same price, even if AMerican was cheaper I'd still opt for the other airline."
127,"""American Airlines"" are CROOKS in a red, white, & blue outfit. I wouldn't let them transport my pet SNAKE!!!  I had a family emergency. I cancelled my flight. I was told, I could use it towards a credit. It's been 3 months. I feel like a tennis ball, between Flight Hub & American Airlines. Both keep referring me, to each other.   ""American Airlines"" told me they have a special deal; If I book the flight by 9/30/22 & use it by 12/31/22, I can get a credit.  Flight Hub won't budge. American Airlines their Customer Service?  They put, you on hold & you end up being transferred to a dial-tone; then it hangs UP!  Our Country is going to HELL in a hand basket.  ""American Airlines"" will take you there.  NEVER AGAIN!!AA has 82% BAD Reviews. They will go bankrupt!!! I see people lost thousands. Vengeance belongs to GOD!  I place the crooks; in HIS Hands on behalf of everyone they ripped off!!! In Jesus NAME.  Then they will remember the way they ROBBED 82% of customers who wrote reviews!!!  Watch & SEE!!!"
128,American Airlines is the most dishonest company. They kept $300+ and wasted HOURS of my time showing and proving to them that they are keeping our Trip Credit and not applying it to our flight. I truly wish that I did not have to fly on this airline ever again. Absolutely terrible which is abundantly clear based on all of the other awful reviews.
129,I have a first class ticket toMiami from LAX and I stroll into the lounge to relax for 45 minutes only to be told that my first class ticket is not applicable to lounge entry since the plane has only 2 sections not 3. What makes this the biggest joke is the terminal is empty and the lounge as well. It is the day after Labor Day! The people at the desk are like robots and the policy is just idiotic. This is the worst airline to fly. They don‚Äôt even fake it well. Their people are just too disinterested to care. I went to the customer service desk to complain ( just exhausted and it‚Äôs is 11.40 pm) but they could care even less. One last never even turned to face me when I was speaking. Terrible.
130,Awful experience with American airlines. Flight delayed over 3 hours with no explanation. Stewards on plane extremely rude and unhelpful. Trying to get compensation for delay but AA not responding. Would never book them again.
131,Tried to charge me 300 USD to move my pregnant partner 1 seat. They then gave the seat free to someone else. And that wasn't even the worst thing about my flight. Do not use.
132,"American Airlines operated the British Airways flights from San Diego to Dallas Fort worth and Dallas to Heathrow. At San Diego Airport, the staff were literally abusive. The supervisor told me ""I am the ticketing expert and I know more about ticketing than my boss"" after i asked to speak to her boss about a change made to our tickets (changing a 1.5 hour layover to an 8 hour layover at Heathrow). I said, ""Why have you changed our flight tickets without notifying us?"". Her response, ""I don't know"". My response, ""but you just said you were the ticketing expert and that isn't acceptable when we now have an 8 hour layover"". She responded by putting her hand up to my face and aggressively stating ""I don't deal with smart Alex's, take a step back I am not dealing with you smart Alex"". Now, this is an AA staff member but we booked through BA and so AA are representing BA and name calling their customers. Then my bag was 6 lbs over the allowance and the check in assistance burst out laughing and stated happily ""you're going to have to pay a fee"". I just took some clothes out and put them in my cabin bag. However, her response was putrid. She tried to deny that BA had changed our flight which there is no point in arguing over as the proof is in writing. She couldn't register that it was only our last of 3 flights we were enquiring about. She seemed really confused over the simple task of printing our boarding passes and that alone took about 10 minutes. She told us irrelevantly, ""you should have been here between 2 and 3 hours before your flight departs"", while we were standing there checking in 3 hours before our flight was departing. Then when we let her know we were 3 hours early, she said, ""you should have came here at 4 am"". That irrelevant advice was for a 9.20 am flight. The flight from Dallas to Heathrow was cramped and dirty. The food was the worst plane food I have ever had too."
133,"Bought my ticket on AMERICAN AIRLINES website. It wouldn‚Äôt allow me to check in on the app or the kiosk inside the airport. Went to the check in desk to get help. Was told my ticket wasn‚Äôt any good, I needed to purchase another ticket. Never gave me a valid reason on why my ticket didn‚Äôt work. Told me to dispute it with my bank. This is my first time purchasing a ticket through AA, I usually fly Delta! Worst experience ever, couldn‚Äôt board my flight at all. Before I even left the airport they marked me as a no-show when the flight hadn‚Äôt even took off or boarded yet."
134,"In the last week I have had 4 flights. Worst service ever! Zero personality from any staff and actually witnessed personnel yelling at older customers! Had a connecting flight canceled for no given reason and were basically told we were on our own. No warning, no compensation, no help ‚Ä¶ figure it out, we don‚Äôt care! Will never use this airline again!!!"
135,"American Airlines time and time again proves why they‚Äôre ranked ‚Äúthe worst airline in America.‚Äù AA‚Äôs customer service policies are simply horrendous. My flight out of DCA was delayed, causing me to miss my connecting flight in Chicago. AA claimed the delay was unavoidable, despite it stemming from AA‚Äôs poor planning regarding Labor Day weekend air traffic. I was rebooked for the next morning, but offered no hotel, no meals, no voucher, nothing. To make matters worse, only God knows where my checked bag is. Do yourself a favor and fly with a different airline. AA makes Spirit look good."
136,"Took American Airlines AA 2078 out of Sacramento CA, connector Dallas Forthworth then on to Raleigh NC. Our plane was late due to weather from where the plane came from But was told no problem we will get there with enough time for connector, then!! The next delay mechanical problems that was a quick fix NOT!! over 40 minutes, we were told all good we will make it. We landed with ANOTHER issue, a plane was in our spot and had to wait for them to leave another 25 minutes which caused us to miss connector by MINUTES!!! and was met by a rude staff saying this was all weather related. Until I called 800 customer service was I told this was due to mechanical difficulties and they could not believe we were put on stand by. I did not purchase stand by tickets, I am a type 1 diabetic and plan my trips the best I can and yes issue arise but this was three issues on one flight!!! NO!! Compensation, just well you are in stand by, 800 customer service got us on a confirmed flight the next day so here my wife and I are in airport waiting until morning, this all took place between 9:15 and maybe midnight, at this point what the hell does one do, leave and get a room..ok where, then we need a ride to get a hotel, just one messed up circumstances after another. You can bet this is not the last American Airlines hear from me. NEVER AGAIN will I trust American Airlines with my vacation, my health, never again."
137,"1. Our flight from Orange County to dfw was delayed by 20minutes. 2. There were a lot of tight transfers on the flight, and the flight attendants did absolutely nothing to make sure the transfers got off first. 3. Then the ground crew was no where to be found for 20 minutes. So, someone at the desk had to go retrieve our car seats for the transfer. 4. We missed our transfer after running from terminal A to terminal C. DFW is one of the biggest airports in the U.S. 5. Lady at the desk didn‚Äôt acknowledge myself or anyone else in the line for more than 15minutes. I gave up and called. The person behind the desk was in a deep personal conversation with another employee. Myself and other customers thought we may have been on candid camera it was so bad. 6. Lastly, with so many customers running late from our plane for transfers, the plane took off 5 minutes early. Really, we missed our flight bc it took off early? Other airlines, I remember waiting for some late transfers. Was our seats sold to standby? It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating when no one on AA cared about the customers. 7. Then with two young children (3 & 5), we were given an 8:30pm flight, that delayed to 10:26pm. Not to mention the numerous gate changes in between. By the way, it was terminal changes. This 10hr day became 17hrs with kids. This is my first time on American Airlines, and I‚Äôm so shocked to have all the rumors and poor service come to life."
138,"Worse Experience ever!! Flight was delayed not once not twice but 3! Times all updates and changes that were received via txt we NOT honored even though it was not our fault delays were happening. Person checking us in at terminal were HORRIBLE rude , unhelpful , definitely not courteous and a complete joke. The only thing she stated was that we would need to spend the night in Dallas and their air line ‚Äúdoes not pay for hotel‚Äù even though it was their responsibility to make it right‚Ä¶ our luggage will be in Detroit while we are stuck in Dallas‚Ä¶ We will NEVER EVER FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES‚Ä¶ if you want to avoid a TRIP FROM HELL ..AVOID THIS AIRLINE."
139,"This is horror, what I went trhought. The day before this flight,same company cancel my flight. I bought new ticketd with United,everything went good,I manage somehow to Corpus. Next day I used my ticket with American again ,to try to go back to Orlando.My flight was deleyed 7 times,we were waiting after that in a plane 2 and half hours before we took off. Terrible company,stay away!If I were dying and this is the only company available,I would rather die than go again through same pain, and this is not first time by the way."
140,"Not advisable, or do not ever make the big mistake to booking in this airline, they should not exist to begin with. Everything is none existing. Run away as far as you can."
141,What a disappointment. Flight was cancelled from LA to London without notifying us.  Then no gluten free food for my daughter and they sat our children separately even though they had medical conditions.  Then they offer me trip credit I cannot use. I have asked for a voucher or refund but they‚Äôve refused.  I advise not to book this airline. Oh and the flight out of London was also cancelled.  The customer relations team are rigid and have not even looked into what happened.
142,"I recently flew from London to Bangor via Charlotte. I had requested in advance a vegan option for myself and my companion. Despite this, there was no vegan option available. The crew actually asked me what ‚Äòvegan‚Äô was. I absolutely don't expect everyone to know or care about all types of dietary requirements, unless of course you work in hospitality! So after explaining that ‚Äúvegan is like vegetarian, but with no diary or eggs‚Äù, I was given a tray with a piece of bread (which seemed stale), a pack of butter, a block of cheese, a chocolate cake, and two crackers. I could only eat the crackers, and I spent the whole flight hungry.To distract myself from my hunger I was hoping to watch some of the in-flight entertainment, but the entertainment unit for my seat was not working, rendering it impossible to watch anything at all. Additionally, there was an issue with the air conditioning, the temperature of the entire cabin was extremely cold with passengers shivering and showing their goosebumps to the cabin crew who didn't seem able to do anything.I put this down to bad luck and (hopefully) an isolated incident, however on the flight home our first flight was cancelled and we were moved onto another flight  ‚Äì obviously there was no record of my meal requests on the new flight, and so again I had to explain what vegan meant, and all I could eat on the flight was again a cracker. In comparison, when flying BA, I have had staff come over to great my and explain what food options are being offered today. They are totally clued up on dietary requirements, and everything on board lists the allergens (the UK is good like that), as these days there are so many allergy triggers!It is clear that training is needed for the AA cabin crew on dietary requirements, and improvements required in the range and availability of products in-flight (especially long haul), so that other travellers can avoid long flights of boring, freezing, starvation. I am sure this is not the standard that American Airlines wishes to deliver, but unfortunately this is my experience to date, and it is totally unacceptable. On this basis, I would not choose to travel again with American Airlines."
143,This is my second time with this airlines and both times where ridiculous. American Airlines has to be the worse airlines on the planet. Everything they can mess up the do they lost my luggage plane delayed every possible way. The customer service is super bad so bad I can‚Äôt even put into words. I will never fly American Airlines again no matter what. This airlines will make any trip a nightmare. I would rather walk ! How do they stay in business I have no clue. First class has no tv and only 20 min of internet. Lol what a joke.
144,"American Airlines, your staffs (MOST) in the Philippines messed up by bookings, booked me to travel on two fights at the same time to my destination, cancelled my booking then hang the phone up on me. Call back immediately and stayed 1hr and 39 mins on a call to fix my original booking back. Call back to pay for booking and only to be told it was cancelled and re booked WITHOUT my permission/involvement, no email or call was made to notify m. Ask to speak with the manager and was told she (ALICE) does want to speak with me, after still insisting for my booking to be reinstated the agent hanged up on me. Tried again to get this resolved and again still no solution"
145,"They sent me a paper voucher that it is almost impossible to use as the customer needs to send by ordinary post to their office instead of issuing e vouchers. Besides, they never answer the calls or emails. I feel strongly dissapointed with AA and will never fly with AA again."
146,"Flight 930 26/08/22 (Locator SKBLUJ) GRU to MIA (passenger Gleyce Carrasco + 2 kids). American Airlines violated my rights on this flight. I will make sure that this has repercussions and I will also take legal action publicly if the company does not recant what happened.I am a mother and travelled with my 2 underage children, a 13-year-old daughter and a 9-year-old son, the company had the nerve to put my daughter seated separate from me, with 3 unknown men, I begged them to be placed together and the only answer I got from the flight attendants was that I would have to find someone who wanted to change seats with me, THIS IS ABSURD, a child cannot travel unaccompanied and the company has to take care of this when buying the ticket, the commissioners have to solve the problem and not just throw the problem for me to solve, dishonesty is the least bad of words to describe this absurdity, my daughter having to travel alongside 3 unknown men, on a night fly of approximately 10 hours, I DEMAND RESPECT AMERICAN AIRLINES AND I WAITING FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE RETRACTION, otherwise we will find ourselves in the courts, unscrupulous officials. I write this crying with anger at this company."
147,"Another disaster flying an American flight in first class with American Airlines unable to provide sufficient bandwidth on an hnl to lax flight (16 August 2022). It really doesn't take much for American airline businesses to provide superior anything; that is unless you're flying AA. What corporate operation head holds such a position that the responsible head does not have a clue how to assure sufficient inflight broadband, should be terminated. You're on nearly a five hour flight back, and unable to watch or listen to entertainment. Wait, AA though makes sure you're forced to watch three of it's BS commercials though beforehand with broadband. Then bam, the cocktail waitress (your first class flight attendant) in the sky delivers, ""Unless you jump on real fast there are those who cannot connect through.""Throwing salt on the wound. The inflight entertainment and information pamphlet doesn't state access is limited. It's a WT_? This type of poor service reminds me of my last International business class flight in January 2020 on Cathy Pacific. Horrible all around bull nothingness fisted without pre-greasing first. AA offers nothing special in the air or on the ground. EVA home runs evey American airline business out of the air. Heck, PAL blows them out of the air as well. AA is the last airline I would recommend anyone flying. Thank you AA for turning what I was hoping to be a great experience cap into one of FU American Airlines. Good job on proving support that the American airline business is just as horrible as ever."

149,"Besides all the issues related to a flight cancelled 8h prior departure, they failed again on our coming back flight (we were a group of six and 2 didn‚Äôt have a boarding pass printed as should), they also sent their luggage in a different flight which I guess it is illegal. After a big battle with customer service we got a miserable flight credit ($125) and I could never get my refund for the cancelled flight (which generated almost 3,5K on expenses) since they blame booking.com now. Asked for help and got just mediocre reply mails saying they cannot do anything to help! Sally, you are a joke! There is nothing good about this company, actually if hell had headquarters on earth that would be American Airlines. Stay away, or regret later like myself!"
150,"I was a former pilot with American Airlines who upgraded faster than any pilot in American Airlines history. I was also a former USAF pilot. I flew the E-3A AWACS with a crew of 21 to 15 different countries. I was diagnosed with Bipolar Depression by American Airlines to keep me from going to the media after a door ripped off of an A-300 Airbus that I was piloting on a landing in San Martin. I discovered that it was the fourth time that THAT door ripped off of THAT aircraft TWICE at THAT runway. I was hospitalized against my will a week later even though in the previous week Dr John Herrlin passed me with a FIRST CLASS FAA MEDICAL CERTIFICATE. I hate the label since I suffer from sleep apnea, not bi-polar depression. An anesthesiologist with Willow Bend Dental told me I should sue whoever made the original and subsequent diagnoses. People with mental illnesses enrich our lives! A few public figures who shared my illness include Abraham Lincoln, Virginia Woolf, Lionel Aldridge, Eugene Oneill, Beethoven, Gaetano Donizetti, Robert Schumann, Leo Tolstoy, Vaslov Nyinsky, John Keats, Tennessee Williams, Vincent Van Gogh, Isaac Newton, Ernest Hemmingway, Sylvia Plath, Michelangelo, Winston Churchill, Vivien Leigh, Emperor Norton 1, Jimmy Piersall, Patty Duke, Charles Dickens, and Robin Williams. Now that is a group that I am PROUD to be a member of!!! Don't judge us until you have walked a mile in their shoes. Anyone know a good lawyer??!! When I brought in my pictures to the New York flight office to Dick Kyte, he told me that I was no longer fit to fly! The ALLIED PILOTS association backed the company, the ALLIED FLIGHT ATTENDENTS association backed the company, the ALLIED MECHANICS association backed the company. BOB CRANDALL, the CEO who took a $273 Million Dollar Golden Parachute and bankrupted the company backed the company. EVERYONE backed the company except for the FAA DOCTOR WHO SAID THAT I WAS FIT TO FLY FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When I went to Queens General for a ""REEVALUATION"", SIX GUYS GRABBED ME, STRAPPED ME TO A TABLE AND INJECTED ME WITH SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP ME RELAX. THREE DAYS LATER, I WOKE UP WITH A PANTS FULL OF CRAP AT BELVIEW HOSPITAL IN MANHATTAN. THEY SAID I WAS BI-POLAR. I FOUGHT THIS CASE ALL THE WAY UP TO THE NEW YORK SUPREME COURT WHERE THE JUDGE TOLD ME THAT I COULD EITHER TAKE THE MEDICATION OR HAVE COURT MANDATED ELECTRO-SHOCK THERAPY. I THOUGHT I WAS BEING PUNKED BY ASHTON KUTCHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
151,"In 44 years I‚Äôve never seen anything so dis-organised and unhelpful in all my life when it comes to airlines. After 2 hours of waiting past our flight time American Airlines finally cancelled the flight due to plane issues. There was no clear attempt or a reasonable plan to try and get everyone on a different flight the same day or through another airline. We also had to argue and challenge the airline to get our bags back for many hours afterwards before they put us up in a hotel for the night.The airline expects customers to come back the next day without washing and with yesterdays clothes on for another 11 hour flight. It was chaos and very stressful, never again will I fly with them. It‚Äôs definitely worth paying more to fly with an airline that knows what their doing and will treat customers better than this.All my plans have turned upside down cause of this and I‚Äôve lost money with things I had organised to do in LA and time with friends I haven‚Äôt seen for years."
152,We booked months in advance. First class. We chose our seats. I have anxiety. Both flights they separated us. Because of this we will never fly again. We will drive.
153,They destroy my computer and bag and then they told me sorry we can't do anything for you.
154,Nice service on the plane but not so nice when in comes to adding rewards to your account
155,I wish I could give this airline a negative My 71 year old had a flight cancelled on her birthday with no work around. Never fly this airline they have canceled flights and leave kids alone. Customer service was rude when calling in to try and figure out a new flight.
156,"20 years ago, because of their many canceled flights, I chose to use other airlines. This year I decided to give them another try. Much to my disappointment, they are worse than ever before. They are the most UNRELIABLE and UNETHICAL airlines to date. They canceled 3 of my flights causing me to be stuck overnight in Florida, and they told me to get a hotel and they would reimburse me. When I went to turn in my receipts, the fax number posted on their website didn't work and the address, I was told by other employees won't work. So I finally went online to file a claim where the customer service offered me 7500 points (maybe worth $75) instead of reimbursing my hotel and lyft which totaled over $300. Now I have to take them to small claims. So ridiculous and unethical. AVOID AT ALL COST - this company lacks integrity!"
157,American Airline is one of the worst airline on this planet. I think their employees hate their job their attitude is so negative they must be living a miserable life I had promised myself I will never fly this airline again and somehow I end up booking another international flight even if they give me a free ticket next time I will never fly this airline where the employees are miserable and seems like they hate their job it reflects as they treat their customer very rudely.
158,I travelled three times with amerian airlines. None of them is on time. The worst experience is from Dallas to college station. We have boarded and waited in airport for two hours and then told we couldn‚Äôt take off! 2 am kicked out of airplane and no place to go. Will never buy American Airlines anymore
159,"AA just canceled my December flight from Miami to the Caribbean. No email notice but I saw the change in my app. I called to inquire about my options. I asked if I could be rebooked to a neighboring island since there are no other alternate flights to my original destination and then I would get to my original destination on my own with a separate local flight, which includes additional expenses on me (local flights, taxi to other airport...) because of AA. The first agent was great and made the change, also said I would have 24 hrs to make any further changes, otherwise it would be voluntary and involving fees/fare difference, which sounded standard and fair. I called back 10 hours later the next agent was very weird about the fact my destination change had happened saying the first agent made a mistake and they should have charged me the fare difference. I am just trying to get on the earlier flight because I have to go to another airport to catch my local flight to make it on my own and I need more time to connect there. No luck and a disappointment. I have tried to fly 3 times with AA to that destination in the past 2 years and they always cancel and there are no other good alternative flights/airlines unfortunately. I had no idea that the first agent made a mistake, and it sounds like I'll have to also pay an overnight to connect now. Not sure why they make it so hard to travel..."
160,"Someone told me to look up new legislation on aviation rulings on this:American Airlines on my first anniversary trip as well as my husbands 65 birthdayI booked first class tickets for a cruise in Alaska.  We left fort myers Aug 6.  And had a beautiful cruise. On my trip back from Seattle on American airlines I was booted out of first class and sat in the back. I was told they had oversold first and since I had no point ‚Äú status‚Äù I was being delegated to the back of the plane along with two useless vouchers.  The flight attendant apologized for the issue of over sell and said if she had anything left from the food on first class she would bring it back. Food I paid for, but evidently there was nothing left. I personally don‚Äôt fly first class because of the coveted ‚Äústatus points‚Äù or the copious amount of ‚Äúcool‚Äù points I get flying AA, I do so not for the glorious mileage status with you, but because I am 62 years old and have Multiple Sclerosis .  Being able to be physically comfortable and able to walk off the plain without assistance is more important to me then useless American Airlines points. Discriminatory doesn‚Äôt even cover this. The greedy mistake was on your part  by over selling a commodity you didn‚Äôt have.,not mine. You over sold and I had to pay the price. My disability is  def not status worthy to American Airlines. What good our vouchers I will never use as I will not be flying with American Air again.  As usual in this country Americans with disabilirties are far less important then your ‚Äú mile status‚Äù . It‚Äôs clearly my fault for not being worthy of consideration, except for the consideration of being the fall guy for your over sold mistake!Having MS , carefully making my plans in advance, purchasing tickets to make sure I would be comfortable on this once in a lifetime vacation ( we are not wealthy or clearly we would have lots of miles and points and status) is certainly not as glamorous as having miles points.  You send me a voucher  for 600$? For two first class tickets? Is this even legal?"
161,"My luggage became missing on July 31, 2022. I have spent many hours trying to locate my baggage with American Airlines (AA) since then, spending most of my time on hold. I was initially told that I would be reimbursed for items that I have had to purchase due to my items being missing whether or not they found my luggage. I was informed today, August 10, 2022, that they will not reimburse me for such purchases if my luggage is found. I would never have had to make these purchases had my luggage not gone missing, regardless of whether or not they find it. I was also told today that they will have 45 days from the date I submit a claim to find my lost bag. Initially I was told that they have 45 days from the date my bag went missing. The claim requires a complete list of all items in my suitcase. This has taken quite some time to complete, yet had I known that the 45 day clock started once submitted, I would not have waited to submit it. My claim totals $1,774.31, but I am to wait until September 24, 2022 before I see any reimbursement. Due to items missing, I cannot utilize my gym membership, properly care for my eyes or skin, or promote my small business. I have had to make many purchases since July 31 to be able to go about my daily life and it has caused me a severe financial hardship. I have described the exterior description of my suitcase to many agents (Samsonite brand, blue, hard case, black sipper, number code TSA locks), yet they insist that a black suitcase left at JFK airport is mine, almost shipping it to me. Lastly on our way to our destination or flight was cancelled almost causing us to miss 2 connecting flights. We struggled to find an agent willing to assist us, but someone was eventually able to find us a flight at another airport. While they provided us with a taxi voucher to get us to the other airport, when we arrived, the check in counter was closed. We were forced to sleep on the tile floor next to strangers for 5 hours, until it opened."
162,"Scheduled a flight for my college commencement ceremony. After unexpected expenses from, ya know, the trash economy I cancelled the flights. No where did it say they were nonrefundable. I requested a refund and was denied. I called in to see if I could explain it all and the rep assured me this happens all the time and not to worry. Even gave me refund processing times. But it was denied again. They just keep implying I'm just out of luck. They gave me a flight credit but I explained my ID loses flight compliance soon and that since the expenses are ongoing (increased childcare costs) that I won't be able to use them before they expire AND that I booked this for a one-time event. I filed a case with BBB and they sent the same canned response. They are a 6 Billion Dollar company and can't give me $800 back. I even asked for a partial refund. They are money hungry people that don't care even a little bit about their customers. They won't even listen. Because I used Affirm I will be paying on a flight I'm not taking. I will be sure to NEVER book with them again. EVER!"
163,"I stopped flying AA a few years ago after being a customer for years. Their service started declining about 10 years ago. The staff has some nasty attitudes and from a corporate level they are corrupt. A family member gifted me some points and I wanted to buy a few more. After paying, they changed how many points would be needed to use towards a flight. I wanted to cancel the transaction and they flat told me on the phone they weren't going to give any refunds. The flight ended up costing me double what it would have if I would have just paid with no points. It should be noted, that this company even gets an 'F' rating in its hometown of Dallas, TX through their BBB. This company should fold. They refuse to do the right thing by people."
164,The worst airline they have pilots without experience they change flights all the time without notice.
165,"Took a flight with them, Tulsa-DFW-Austin-DFW and then back to Tulsa. Crew was very friendly. That is my one star. There were no drinks or snacks. At all. On any of the flights. That is a star missing per flight. And the first flight from Tulsa to DFW, they didn‚Äôt even turn on the USB chargers. This flight also smelled like urine."
166,Worst airline EVER. Been sitting on the plane for over an hour. Baby crying and screaming and the captain keeps coming up with excuses as to why we can‚Äôt get off the plane. I have to fly with AA next week but this won‚Äôt happen again
167,Zero stars but had to leave one. Worst experience at an airport ever. Staff dont care no help. Meant to leave Friday for nashville and still at airport now. Cost me over 2000 dollars for extra hotel in new york as 6 travelling including 3 children and an 82 year old to see her daughter who she hasnt seen since 2019 due to pandemic. Flight been delayed 3 times already today plus whole party sat in single seats on plane. Horrendous airline will never use again
168,Inhuman!! They did not provide any refund for age old who were not able to travel due to health reasons.
169,"Tuesday, August 2, the blonde American FLIGHT ATTENDANT between the ages of 57 and 65 who attended this flight and was the one who was in charge of boarding, landing, and the passengers behaved very rude and arrogant before taking off and during the flight .... like us, other passengers and acquaintances of ours from Miami who thought the same and will also do Negative Reviews .....ATTENTION AMERICAN AIRLINES!!I flew in Priority and my daughter in row 16... before takeoff she asks my daughter if she can change seats to sit between two people, when I had paid $93 for my daughter's aisle seat.... my daughter said NO!!On another occasion I got up to go see my daughter and told her come see me, while my daughter was walking into the business cabin, this grumpy and arrogant blonde flight attendent came running behind us, tapping my daughters arm aggresively and asks her, where are you going? She made my daughter cry and I even asked her, why this aggressive behavior?... she went to look for the Puerto Rican companion, to find out if she had allowed me to receive my daughter in priority... what is this behavior?? First time I come across something like this! I do not feel pleasant and after spending that ticket in Priority, flying with American Airlines and this type of rude crew. She deserves to be kicked out of the company.I hope the Central Offices take note."
170,"I couldn't book a seat, so the only available one was a middle seat. On my side there was a woman with a dog on her arm/lap which was constantly moving around. I didn't know they allow them outside of a cage/bag. When I asked the flight attendant if there was another seat or if they had allergy pills, she was very rude and replied ""That's not my problem"". I told her it would be hers if I couldn't breathe due to an allergic shock. She just left!"
171,Despite having all documents lady at counter didn‚Äôt check in us for flight. Manager even was agree she should have check us in we had all documents.it was too late by the time manager talk to us.  We had to book ticket from our expense next day and we was able to travel. Customer service is not issuing us refund. It was completely unknowledable  person was at check in counter . She had no idea about entering country and transitioning from airport required different documents. We had to book next days ticket for international travel . Me and my kids went to so much trauma and still can‚Äôt forget this . Without our fault we had to go through this.Nobody help us at airport . Worst customer service at the airport.
172,It‚Äôs the worst airline nothing is on time Terrible airline people are stranded for days and getting rolled over from one flight to another
173,"Please be aware that on 8/4/22, I spoke with your employee, Shaq Webber, about a refund that I needed. I only called for the ticket number in order to process of my refund. Mr. Webber was not helpful, began laughing at my frustration at one point, and then when I asked to speak to someone else, he would not allow it at first. I became more assertive, and he finally put me on hold for thirteen minutes. At this time, Becky Furr from your company came on the phone, and proceeded to give my ticket information to process my refund.Please be advised that I spent over $430 on my ticket and was never issued a refund, despite cancelling my flight within the twenty-four hour period. I booked through Expedia. Spirit Airlines instantly gave me a refund, while American Airlines sent me to a website which required two additional phone calls to process same. I am still unsure if I will receive my refund. I just want to make you aware that Mr. Webber was not helpful. And it‚Äôs literally his job to be helpful. And he did not care when I advised I would be complaining. In fact, he welcomed it."
174,1. Worst Airline2. Customer service/agent is rude and bossy3. Website is confusing. 4. Bought a preferred seat worth USD330 and they put us back to the original standard seats. Good thing I checked it earlier before the flight5. Email reply took more than a week.6. Email content states there is a chat on the website but there is none.
175,This is the worst airline in America. Don‚Äôt fly American airline spent the extra money and just fly with anyone else but them. 2 hour delay seating in our seats it‚Äôs so frustrating
176,The worst airline by far. They will cancel your flight. They will say it is weather related. They will make you wait 2.5 hours to speak with a live individual. That individual will be rude and condescending.
177,Horrible experience. Got stuck in the Carolinas for an entire weekend. No other flights. What gives AA?!
178,"I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS AIRLINE. STOP! Immediately book with Delta or Southwest. I usually fly delta or Southwest. American does not meet the service level that Delta or Southwest has. The attendants are not friendly, flight 2798 has been delayed several times and the plane is sitting in the hangar. They do t have staff to get the plane.  Now we have been delayed another hour because no crew to operate the planes? I‚Äôve been in the airport for over 6 hours. This is most how you treat your customers."
179,Cancelled First class tickets and didn't refund.  American Airlines has not responded or acknowledged and it has been 45 days now.  I have attempted to contact them many times but after hours of waiting on hold their customer support says that they don‚Äôt handle refunds and they don‚Äôt respond to emails or fax.  I believe this is a clear violation of my rights as they have not refunded me for first class tickets that they cancelled.
180,"Flew from Nashville to Quito with an hour stop in Miami in late July 2022. Flight to Miami was fine, apart from the ludicrous check in system that took about an hour longer than it needed to. Once we got into Miami we found our next flight been delayed about an hour. No worries, even multiple hour delays are expected sometimes, I can deal with that. But from there it got ridiculous. Boarded the plane in Miami, sat on the tarmac for two hours with no refreshments while the cabin crew made up excuses. First it was technical issues, then a shortage of crew members, then finally no pilot. We were asked to exit the plane but assured it would be a short delay. Once we were off the plane they cancelled the flight and told us to get into line for rebooking. The rebooking line took 9 HOURS for us, but as more and more flights were cancelled, people were standing in line for up to 15 hours! When we finally reached the front of the queue we were told that the flight was cancelled due to weather, despite being told that there was no captain, AND witnessing a multitude of other flights taking off and landing during this 'weather'. Because of this absolutely blatant lie of a  cancellation reason we were entitled to NOTHING but a seat on the next flight out (for us 24 hours later). We wanted to fly back to Nashville that night with a refund so we could rebook with a competent airline, but we told ‚Äòyou can‚Äôt because it was cancelled due to weather‚Äô. No hotel vouchers, no food vouchers and even the free water bottles and single cookies had run out 5 hours prior. Not even an apology. There was a group behind us flying somewhere else that would miss a funeral if they couldn't leave the following morning and were just told 'too bad'. We were forced to sleep on the filthy floor of Miami Airport in 20 degrees C (68 F) aircon all night. Finally we made it to Quito where of course I discovered that they had lost my backpack. It has now been two days with no updates and I am stuck in 5 degrees C (41 F) weather with nothing but a thin jumper and shorts. ON MY HONEYMOON.I know Delta and United aren‚Äôt perfect, but this airline actively hates it's customers and will never lift a finger to help you, despite receiving billions of your taxes in bailouts over covid. I will never fly with them again and you should avoid them like the plague. Absolute joke."
181,If there was a way to leave no stars I would. Payed for a flight for me and my husband and couldn‚Äôt make it because the pandemic and they have flat out refused to refund me they only said I can move it to another flight in USA. I‚Äôm from UK and no plans to come back to USA it‚Äôs now been two years they still refuse to give my money back. Not to mention the customer service agent was so rude to me I‚Äôm shocked she has a job. Every other company I booked flights and hotels with for that trip refunded me as covid was a pretty good excuse. American Airlines only one who have outright stolen my money and been so difficult to deal with. Please done book with them use JetBlue even with a non refundable ticket they refunded me. Bad bad bad company all round and I bet they go bust.
182,Worst airline ever. Flight delayed..Tried to rebook..Paid extra for seats NO REFUND..No hotel paid for bc delay was due to weather..No concern. 2 hr wait on phone..THEY SUCK..6025007228..Do right American Airlines
183,AA lost my baggage and didn‚Äôt care. Horrible customer service - impossible to contact and when we finally made contact they were entirely without knowledge or mandate. Never fly American.
184,"This is a horrible airline, I was assigned two seats that weren‚Äôt even together. My sister and I traveled to Arizona and we were separated to a completely different part of the plane. They gave us both middle seats on the opposite sides of the plane. I asked to have the seats changed to several different people and they tried to charge me for a seat change. I notified them that I was pregnant and I preferred to have a aisle seat for easy accessibility to the restroom and they told me sorry we can‚Äôt help you because we can‚Äôt kick someone out of their seats. The customer rep was horrible and nasty no help was offered by any of the parties. How does a major airline not offer any accommodations to paying customers. I will never fly this airline in the future. My experience traveling to Arizona through Delta was so much better. One star is definitely being generous with this review."
185,"My family and I are traveling abroad. We are spending $12,000 between 3 bookings. We decided to change our flight to 8 hours earlier. 2 first booking free of charge. 3rd booking with another representative 1500x5 additional . They raise their website price by almost 100 percent in one minute. The rep said its because there's only 7 seats left. I went back type in a name and found there are 40+ seats left on the plane."
186,"Absolute wreck. Missed our connection Philly to Rome due to mechanical delay. Gate agent rebooked us on Aer Lingus through Dublin ( never go to Dublin Airport) but didn‚Äôt put ticket number on boarding pass from Dublin to Rome- 24 hrs in Dublin (aka: Hell) booked on flight to Naples. Both bags never made it out of Philly- without luggage entire 10 days. Upon return, still no luggage and only answer I get is ‚Äúthey‚Äôre in Philly‚Äù which begs the question: Then why aren‚Äôt they sent home to me?!?!?‚Äù"
187,"We are currently waiting to get my husband a seat after the check in agent de-seated him after we realized our last flight was wrong.  She asked us to call Expedia to make changes and we asked her to not change anything and she agreed, well when we realized everything was fine she ended up de-seating my husband!!!! Now we have to figure out where he is seating! It really has been a nightmare."
188,"I had a flight from Philadelphia to Greenville SC and connection flight in between to Charlotte on July 3rd 2022 . Delay after delay, very unfriendly customer service, lost my luggage after I checked in at the gate in Charlotte, still not found. Worse airline experience ever."
189,"I fly often for business and usually fly Delta since I live near Atlanta. In the last year I have tried using American Airlines for my business travel because the arrival time best coincided with my meetings. On all occasions there has been an issue. Either a delayed flight causing a missed connection, I was forced to sleep in the Chicago airport due to a flight cancelation and all hotels were booked, and on my last flight a gate agent tried to instigate a physical altercation because he asked me to remove my laptop from my bad because they were going to have to gate check it and I was simply trying to ask if the airline was going to allow me to hold it during the flight because it was not in a case. He told me I would just ave to deal with it and to get in the plane. I vow to never again use American even if I have to come in a day early for my meetings so I can fly Delta."
190,The only good thing about this flight is that we landed an hour early.Other than that the flight attendants were salty and horrible.I kindly asked for a napkin and was told to get up and get it myself from the toilet . Absolutely ridiculous.The special food I ordered also didn‚Äôt arrive so I sat hungry for the whole flight .First and hopefully the last time I need to fly with them.Wouldn‚Äôt recommend them to my worst enemy !
191,"For the second time in a row, our flight was delayed. Also, for this flight, I bought first class tickets. That turned out to be a joke. Don't EVER purchase first class tickets for American Airlines. We had a bit more room but that was it. The drinks and pretzels were the same as what the cabin people get. That means I paid about $900 extra for a couple of drinks and a bag of pretzels for my wife and I. A complete rip-off. And, NO. I will never use AA again."
192,"My baby stroller was damaged during our journey from Boston to New York. The leather handle got riped, and other marks were found. It looked like someone pushed the stroller. I made a baggage claim and contacted customer service afterwords. Company said they do not compensate anything thus it was ‚Äùnormal wear and tear‚Äù. Apperantly in American Airlines pushing stroller and getting it riped is a normal thing.If i ever will fly with that airline again, i will also tear the Seat in the airplane and explain it with ‚Äùnormal wear and tear‚Äù‚Ä¶"
193,"Flight 2044 got on African American flight attendant‚Äôs was nasty when we got on. Waited On the runway for a hour they turned off the TVs. When asked why the African American said I didn‚Äôt. We then got to Charlotte and had to wait 4hrs for our flight they changed our gate 6x‚Äôs we ran back and forth then moved us to a Tampa flight cause ours was canceled to find out it wasn‚Äôt canceled. Went to the boarding agent Molly she would not help us then to another Yartisia she refused as well. There was no one that would help us or speak to us. This is exhausting and I will never fly on this airline if they gave me the tickets for free. Emotionally abusive and traumatizing dealing with the staff and inconsiderable behaviors of the employees. Then the gentleman and I say that loosely who was boarding flight 1930 was abusive to the people boarding the flight. Several passengers were canceled and he old them they were boarding the wrong flight. They weren‚Äôt boarding the wrong flight they changed the flight number and never put them in it. Watching the abuse towards the elderly and people who didn‚Äôt speak English was disheartening. Molly, yartasia (sure it‚Äôs a fake name/no name tag)  the African American (also no name tag) flight attendant and the boarding agent, thanks for absolutely nothing and remember karma comes back 10 fold. Disgraceful how you can get away tearing people in this manner. Got in at 1 am then stayed till 2:30am cause of course no bags!"
194,"Used rewards points to book a hotel room. Apparently if you plan on checking in after midnight and you don't call and tell them, they cancel your reservation. So you loose the points and the room, mind you there is no information telling you about notifying hotels prior to arrival."
195,"Hands down the worst domestic airline. Customer service, if you can call it that, makes up rules as they go. Would not let my girlfriend board her international flight over some non existent Covid rule. Meanwhile, I flew from another airport to the same destination with no such rules. $1000 loss after having to rebook with another airline. Choose another airline when you fly, any other airline. Also, the customer service told her to shut up when she questioned the ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù. Unbelievable."
196,"Actually one star is still to much. Spent two hours trying online check-in. Not working. .Had to pay 33 euro for a seat, because one flight had ONLY seats with extra pay available.Submitting check-in form just returns you to start page for check-in. Calling paid help number just hangs up on me,"
197,Gave up the will to live trying to speak to them on the phone.  Someone answered after 26mons then put me on hold for ever. I gave up after 59minsThey say we focus on providing excellent customer service.   Complete BSIf you reading this AA the ref is SUYWKQMaybe you have the good manners to call me and leave a message who I speak to or send me a emailI want to change one flight and no doubt this will be financially to your advantage but let‚Äôs see if that makes any difference I‚Äôm appalled at the service to dateTried calling again and no joy. Gave that up after 34 mins
198,Aa loaded the plane with no pilots on board which equated to no A/C.  I don‚Äôt appreciate sitting in a pool of sweat.
199,I wouldn‚Äôt even give this airline one star. They never have ‚Äúenough room‚Äù for carry ons and there‚Äôs a lot of room in the back of the plane. I will never fly with American ever again. Worst airline EVER!!
200,We flew from Punta Cana to Charlotte then on to Cleveland. The customs area at Charlotte was a disaster and we were delayed getting to our gate for our Cleveland flight   When we got to the gate even though the doors were still open and 10 minutes left before departure they would not let us on because they sold our seats to someone else.  They said they knew customs was backed up but had called our names over the pa but of course we could not hear it in customs. The agent at the gate was very rude but thank goodness able to get us on another flight a few hours later which we then sat on at the gate for over an hour due to a storm. It was out of our control at customs and out of theirs because of the storm but customer service is definitely not their strong suit. Be very concerned if you choose to fly American
201,I can't even begin to explain the mess they caused on our flights and now I just want to a refund for the first class tickets that we purchased and they are only giving partial and won't respond to my emails asking why partial and of course there isn't a number to call them at.
202,"Worst airline experience ever, cancelled flights, lost baggage and stolen items in the bags that have turned up. No customer service, we have received 4 out of 6 bags now, but we still cannot get any help with the last two bags. We are in Mexico and about to start a massive multi-stop journey back to Australia and have received no help tracking the remaining two bags. Avoid at all costs"
203,Delayed flights and lost luggage!!  No customer support - an absolute nightmare of an airline!! AVOID at all costs!!
204,This is now the worst airline. Spirit has passed AA in customer satisfaction. For my entire adult life (24 years) I was an avid customer. However the new cancellation policies coupled with seating is separately when I put chase tickets is simply untenable. I‚Äôm done with American.
205,"My returning flight from Dallas to Houston was cancelled along with my 4 children. They offered no solution for lodging or anything else and our bags were already at our destination. Money had to be spent on hotel, uber to and from the airport and eventually a rental car to get home. The flight was originally purchased through Priceline. Once the airline cancelled and rebooked the flight for Jun, 02 2022 and cancelled again the Travel agency stated that they no longer have any control over the tickets and are not responsible for the refund. AA stated that a refund was issued on June 12,2022 to the travel agency, but as stated Priceline stated they have no notification of the refund and it's not their responsibility as the Airline cancelled the flight. I have contacted customer service from American Airlines and Priceline and keep getting the run around.  It should not be this complicated to receive a refund for a flight that was cancelled not by the customer. I have provided all necessary information and it is now mid-July and have still yet to receive my refund. I was told by AA because I did not have a credit card on file, they did not have anywhere to send the funds to as well and in that instance, I provided my physical home address when requesting a refund and requested a paper check. A service was paid for and not delivered, and they seem as if it's my responsibility to resolve the issue as to why I didn't receive the refund."
206,"During airplane boarding, the display screen showed incorrect information (said Group 2 out of 9 now boarding) even though they were ""inviting all passengers to board."" Given that information, I waited, expecting Group 2 to reach 5 momentarily. Next thing you know, the boarding gate closed and the plane was already taking off; I asked the AA agents there why they had not updated the screen and if they could let me through because I thought it was not my turn yet logically because of the screen information. They apologized and said they couldn't do anything; they even tried to blame it on me for not coming to the gate. Well, now I missed that flight and my ticket is NOT refundable ‚Äî TERRIBLE experience with AA. I've been a loyal AA customer for some time now but this is really off-putting and demotivating for future travel. All I can say now is don't fly with AA ‚Äî use Delta Airlines instead where they can ACTUALLY process a refund in a case like this."
207,"Worst Airline I have ever seen. Canceled my flight i was stuck in Austin. Had to pay for a hotel, Dinner, chargers, tips. Lost a days work. My boss was very upset. Customer service was deplorable. Worst experience ever! I contacted them and nothing. I have contacted their management and no reply. WOW"
208,"I booked a return flight with AA in January, 2022 and leading up to the June 2022 departure there were some laborious administrative difficulties, which were ably resolved by the AA London Heathrow check-in staff. On the return flight from ANC to DFW AA817 06/07/22 I checked-in in person and I requested a window seat. I was issued a boarding pass with a centre seat and I did not query as it was a busy flight and most passengers would have checked-in online. When I boarded the flight the check-in staff was waiting for me in the aircraft together with the cabin crew and gave me a replacement boarding pass with a window seat as one had subsequenty become available. That was above and beyond customer service. Thank you"
209,"First time using your international fight and would be the last, WORST EXPERIENCE EVER, starting from the unprofessional staff at the boarding gate (DFW Airport), she was rude and a racist (she needs love in her life), connecting flight from Charlotte to Munich was crap, showed wifi was available, but then there was NO internet service, asked the flight attendant why no internet and answered rudely that he had no idea and then arrival at my destination Munich, Germany with all ""4 luggages"" with all my camera equipments (Note: No single Lithium battery was checked in, all Lithium batteries I had on my carry on, even paid for extra luggage) and clothing left behind at Charlotte Airport, I am here in Munich for a video production/vacation and no equipments and don't even have clothes to wear. I really can't wait to return back tothe States, there will be a lot of claims to be filed. Thanks for the failure in services. DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES for International flight"
210,The widest airlines and customer service in the USA . I‚Äôm platinum with delta and this was my first time to try AA but never again . You have my bags in Orlando which I checked with your agent but you want me to call another airlines to ask them to get the bags from American Airlines to Cairo where they were suppose to bring it . American aliens even charged me $100 for one of those bags . The widest customer service in history who refuse to even try to help fix their own mistake .
211,The gate agent refused to allow bags on the plane even though I was in first class. When we arrived in Charlotte the first class bags were the last out. We went to the connecting gate and the gate agent refused to let us board even though the plane was connectedto the jetway.. 5 people.. she ignored every one and told us to go to customer service.. no first class seats available and a long delay til the next flight .. why did I do this to myself.. never again
212,"What a circus show.    Luggage leaves without me on plane.    Get to gate and was told there was a change,  but couldn't tell us what or why. Ask me to step aside while everyone else boards, and they told an agent to watch me,  not let me go anywhere like I'm some sort of animal.. very unprofessional!! Tariff couldn't even figure it out and they're suppose to be the brains of the operation.    Best ""they"" could do is get me out next day,  no concession or anything.   Total BS!!   Never again,  will I fly American Airlines"
213,"Flights from Ontario, CA to St. Louis with a change plane in Dallas on July 1, 2022. We got left in Dallas - flight to St. Louis was canceled. (7) flights were canceled & the line of angry stranded passengers was app. 500-700 deep. That wait was unreasonable to get a hotel & bus with no flight the next day - which was booked. They would not release our bags either. So we rented a car & drove 9+ hours to St. Louis. Today is July 3rd ‚Ä¶ still cannot get our bags which contain my meds & items for a conference we are speaking at. Worse experience ever. We used to love American Airlines ‚Ä¶ not so much anymore. Talking to customer service is useless as well. Just the runaround ‚Ä¶ excuses ‚Ä¶ never fly them again."
214,"I want to share a lesson I learned today. American Airlines canceled my flight the day before my departure. I rescheduled for a later flight. When I arrived at the airport I could not check in because, according to them, I was not on the flight. A supervisor asked me to wait in line to rebook my flight (for the second time). After an hour and a half wait, I was given no choice. I lost the entire day, my hotel reservations, and what was supposed to be a great weekend with friends. What makes me most angry is that every single person I talked to lied to me in some way and everyone was sorry but no one could do anything about it (I got to speak to supposedly the senior supervisor, probably a lie too) What I learned is that all airlines are the same. You have to lower your expectations and resign to the fact that there is no way to beat this system."
215,"Within one day, AA has managed to cancel my connecting flight from London into the UK. They have no flights to offer me for 2 days. I was told that I should retrieve my luggage before I go to my hotel for the night. I have been waiting for 3 hours to retrieve my bag. The ""customer service"" person has been absolutely rude and completely unconcerned that I am a cancer patient and need to get my bag with medical supplies. I am sitting by the baggage claim in pain and he absolutely does not care. He took my baggage claim ticket and when I went and asked for it back he said that he entered it into the system and that was all he could do. Now I have no documentation at all. Avoid this company at all cost. Never again."
216,"I was travelling from Dallas to Mexico city and experienced a delay and were stuck on the tarmac for 4 hours. We got very little information about the delay and when we were supposed to take off. When we finally had permission to fly, the pilot wasn't fit for flight because of the delay, and we then had to wait for a new pilot.All passengers got one glass of water and a small bag of pretzels. We were stuck in the aircraft for 7 hours in total. The air time is normally 2,5 hours. This was my first time flying with American Airlines and it was not a good experience. The worst part was the lack of information, but also the shortage of food and water."
217,"We have traveled recently with AA from Heathrow to Dallas. Really impressed with the service we received. Also, being able to contact AA over the phone is amazing compared to some uk airlines. The service we received at the AA desk at Heathrow was excellent. Unfortunately there were problems with our Manchester-Heathrow flight - no bus available to take us from the BA aircraft to the terminal. We watched the AA flight take off‚Ä¶.. extremely frustrating. Once we arrived inside the terminal the gentleman at the AA desk went out of his to help us. When you are going through this kind of thing it‚Äôs nice to speak to someone who actually cares."
218,"My experience with America Airlines this time was disastrous.  I, with my minor daughter and a girl with problems, had the flight scheduled for 8:10 p.m., through gate D1 of the Charlotte airport, at no time was I notified that the flight would go through gate D3 of the same airport.  At 7:45 I realized that something was wrong because the staff that notifies and checks the tickets had not shown up.  When I asked an agent, he told me that they were leaving through gate D3. My daughter and I ran to gate D3, arriving 25 minutes before the flight was supposed to leave, but the flight left around 25 minutes early.  They told us that we had to get another ticket because the plane had already left.  After a long wait and terrible choices, we were given two tickets from Charlotte airport to Fort Lauderdale airport.  Luggage My luggage and my daughter's had gone to the Miami airport where I had to pick it up a day later.  For clarification, I arrived at the airport 3 hours in advance and went through security 3 hours before, so they must have had it in their system that we were there at the airport 3 hours before and we were not notified.  For proof I uploaded the photo of the tickets that we had separated, and the photo of the tickets that were assigned to us later"
219,"Absolutely disgusting customer relations department I have ever dealt with! My husband has a disability and as such he needs an extra leg room seat. There were notes on our booking stating this but AA failed to acknowledge this. As such I spent over 6 hours trying to sort the issue out. I tried every UK number, including their special assistance number but got nowhere. The special assistance number was dead and other phone numbers when answered, told me I had to ring the 800 customer relations number. I also tried to fill in on line but all I got back was a response noting my request for a wheelchair! The next day I was shocked and upset to find I had been charged over ¬£850 for phonecalls to AA's customer relations number! I have since sent emails trying desperately to regain that money and have been met with total contempt! Telling me they do not compensate for expenses occured, despite the fact that this is entirely clearly THEIR fault They do not care two hoots about their customers with disabilities! I am dusgusted by their attitude. We will NEVER fly with them again. As far as I am concerned a disgrace to America!"
220,Wore Airlines in the world 3rd world countries has better airlines then AS
221,Horrible airlines.. I flew from Costa Rica to Miami to Houston with my wife on flight 2230Paid to check in luggage and they lost my luggage.. the phone numbers given by the airlines for help were fraudulent no one answers those numbers
222,"I recently (over a month ago) purchased a first class flight round trip directly from American Airlines website. They have repeatedly made changes to my flights without paying attention to ensure I am getting the service level purchased (trip still has not occurred) - including changing ticket tiers from first class to economy and dropping my preferred seating from the flight I was unable to get a first class ticket for and getting it fixed attempt was unsuccessful. Buyers beware purchasing from American Airlines. I know I will be avoiding them for myself, friends and family in the future."
223,"My son arrived on 6/17 we got his Luggage his sea bag was open the lock was not in the sea bag , he lost his navy uniform so as his boots that‚Äôs $500 another two Nike shoes lots of clothes, we went to claim the lady completely lied to us she told us she opened a claim ,after a week we didn‚Äôt get in touch and couldn‚Äôt find his claim we opened another one still no one cares nothing in Process to find his stuff ,he is heading back tomorrow, he had one day to purchase new uniforms and boots will cost him a good $500 this is really bad to happen to anyone but especially to any member in the military ,we will never travel with American Airlines it cost my sailor over $2000 dollars of lost and repurchase for his belongings"
224,"Worst fears realized.  8 delays and never even got off the ground.  I was supposed to get to a wedding, so this was no casual flight. I believe the corporation is being untruthful about just having adequate staff to run the airline.  Compound the delays with others before you who also got delayed or cancelled and it's impossible to get anywhere except, perhaps, from a hub city.   Time to go back to trains.  I'm not kidding."
225,"On June 14, 2022 I booked two one way tickets from LAX to LAS, business class. The total paid was $537.18.  Seven days later I received an email with a flight change, the new flight was leaving at 7:20 PM instead of 9:00 PM.  Unfortunately our flight is arriving in LAX at 6:45 PM, international terminal.  After collecting luggage and clearing customs there is NO way we can make that flight.  I call American Airlines Customer Service and explained the situation.  I was told that the ticket was Non Refundable and they were sorry.  That was the last flight on American out for the evening.  SO SORRY.  I wrote an email to American Airlines and the response was ‚ÄúI am truly sorry to hear about your experience.  We‚Äôre paying careful attention to the feedback our customers are providing us and the details you shared with us have been made available to our leadership to be be used to improve our service.‚ÄùREALLY.. ‚ÄúYour business means a great deal to us, and I‚Äôd like to ask for another chance to rebuild your confidence.‚Äù  I checked my AAdvantage account and they deposited 7,500 award miles.  I checked my husbands account and he received ZERO, nothing.  WHY?This is just not acceptable, Why are these airlines getting away with this?  We have been flying with American for over 20 years.  This is not our first rodeo with them.  We currently have 4 upcoming trips booked with American.. Do they really care about our business?"
226,"Worst ever my fight was for last night 10:25 pm cancel and changed to this morning @10am after that changed to 1:40 pm now the latest is they‚Äôre saying 10:25 pm ,, will never flight with this company again and they don‚Äôt tell you sh‚Äît just hive you $12 for food üñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñï"
227,I‚Äôm stuck at 10 o‚Äôclock at O‚ÄôHare with like 400 other customers that are stranded. The line is longer than a football field. And currently I am told the flight that could possibly get me to my destination tomorrow won‚Äôt get me there until 10 pm tomorrow. No empathy for the total lack of execution on their part. If I could post a picture of this line on here I would. Total failure on their part. I will never spend another penny to fly with so called airline.
228,"My son flight was delayed yesterday!!! He was calm and fine with the I‚Äôm thankful for his in-laws !!! The ticket person made the statement that she can put him on the next flight which is at 11pm !! ONLY TO HEAR THAT HE CANT BOARD THIS ONE EITHER DUE TO HYDRIC PROBLEMS!!! MY SON REMAINED CALM AGAIN !!!! ONLY FOR HER TO SAY THAT HE COULDN'T  FLY OUT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY !!!! HERES THE FUN PART (THEY PUT HIM LAST AT THE END OF THE LINE , TOLD HIM THAT JUST BECUSE THERE ARE OPEN SEATS DIDNT  MEAN THAT HE CAN GET ON HE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE ) WOW I THOUGHT THIS COMPANY WAS THE BEST AND YES I WAS WRONG AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE FAST FOOD PLACES HAVE BETTER JOB SKILLS !! I SAW THEM THROWING LUGGAGE TALKING CRAP TO EACHOTHER IN FROMT OF ABOUT 20 PEOPLE YES WE ALL HEARD IT !!!! DO NOT FLY WITH THIS COMPANY AA IS AT THE BOTTOM OF OF MY LIST !!!!"
229,"Super service! 1. ELP/PHX: Jennifer Omija, 30617 Keely Warren, 137792. PHX/PVR:  Jay Tomlin, 400580 Mindy Muenker, 153820 Robin R. Jones, 3564853. PVR/LAX: Step Cossio, 650835 Jaci McCaughan, 139464"
230,Had flight booking amended to make our journey unpleasant.  Spent 70 minutes trying to get through to them on phone.  Finally went to customer relations who said they could not help and told us to telephone the number we could not get through to.  Suggest nobody uses them.
231,"In‚Äîflight service and entertainment was decent. That‚Äôs why this is 2 stars and not 1. AA managed to lose my luggage on a connecting flight. There were no AA staff at the final airport so I couldn‚Äôt file a missing baggage claim, as suggested on the website. I couldn‚Äôt contact AA by phone. I sent multiple emails but didn‚Äôt get a response, even weeks later. I could only contact the them by Twitter, which was incredibly frustrating. They would take hours at a time to respond, offering very little help each time, and you could see them responding to less urgent enquiries (and even praise) while ignoring your messages. Initially I was told my luggage would be delivered to my hotel the following afternoon. When this didn‚Äôt happen, I called the airport and was told I had to go and pick it up myself (within an hour before the department closed!), and was told there would be no compensation or reimbursement for my $30 Uber to get to the airport. All of this after going 2 days without access to any of my luggage, including clean clothes and toiletries. The stress this caused almost ruined what was supposed to be a fun trip. Won‚Äôt be using AA again."
232,This trip was above and beyond the last trip. The airline staff was outstanding in making sure that I was taking care of. And the overall trip was very pleasant and smooth. I am looking forward to my next trip.
233,"I have been a loyal AA traveler until now.  I have almost 9 million miles in the program.  There customer service has dropped off a cliff.  I had some travel credits that they would not let me use because they expired 2 weeks earlier.  I thought I had until the end of the year.  Then I paid for first class ticket for my daughter and son-in-law.  Their special meals weren't on the plane.  When they wrote in AA basically said ""too bad so sad"".  It takes forever to get through even though I am platinum.  I will only fly AA if there is not other possibility."
234,"The Golden Age of Air Travel was about 50 years ago.  I wish I could have experienced it because what we have today is...not.  I experienced four cancelled flights on what should have been a relatively simple trip from DC to Port au Prince Haiti, transiting through Miami.  Instead, I was stuck in Miami for a total of 5 nights, all uncompensated by the airline, which cleverly disguises staff shortages as weather.  Perhaps it would help if pilots and flight attendants were still wearing masks.  My bags have been held for 3 days, and this is the second time on this trip.  I encountered exactly one supportive and helpful staff member in Miami.  That's a real shame."
235,"Awful people!!  A $610 ticket became almost $2900 as they negotiated to get a passenger off the plane to sell me a ticket for my son who we already bought a ticket for which they wouldnot honor, or leave him at JFK alone.  They claimed they needed time to calculate taxes, but was just trying to see how much they could charge me as they knew I wouldn't leave my 15 year old alone.  Duress and unconscionable actions by American airlines,  never again!!"
236,"Flight delayed with missing crew and very unprofessional communication (someone literally announced ""oops we realized after boarding we are missing a pilot and hes not answering his phone""), cancelled after over 2 hrs, difficulty rescheduling, rescheduled by a day without notice (from sun to mon), no financial compensation for sleeping overnight at the airport, split up with child during rescheduled flight and spent an hour fighing it (was told ""no one wants to sit next to your 3 year old"" and to just board and ask people to switch seats on the plane), rude customer service, long lines. Several hours on hold/in callback queue, extremely difficult to reach someone for help during situation. Unable to reach anyone for compensation now that it is over."
237,"Awful experience travelling internationally with them. Waiting 5 hours to check my bag in and there was no one to talk to while queuing in Las Vegas airport. All other airlines I have been on will move people who have a flight coming soon forward in the queue but not them they just left customers to queue meaning that even passengers that arrived 3 hours before their flight, like me, missed their flight. The queue took even longer as passengers had to get rebooked on other flights. They should have had one queue for that and one for passengers who would have had a chance to make their flights but there were no staff to be seen to arrange this and very few staff behind the counter who were already working over their shift time. They need a better system and more staff! Show some care towards your passengers travelling internationally. It seemed like their were lots of staff for domestic flights but that the airline does not care about anyone travelling internationally. Also when passengers are upset don‚Äôt shout at them and threaten to kick them off their flight. I saw this happen while I was queuing just because someone was complaining about the queue."
238,Awful.. dysfunctional. Why do we(the taxpayers) keep paying to bail these clowns out when they still cant get it right. Let their poor service and planning put them out of business already!
239,"We were scheduled to fly out of Atlanta on Thursday morning to Montego Bay. Our flight was cancelled a couple of hours before we were supposed to leave. We called customer service and they told us that they didn't have any flights for us until that Saturday! We were in a wedding and would have missed it.  We decided not to take what they were ""offering"" us, and ended up purchasing a flight on Delta for $1300 the same day. We had to do this because the Resort would not give us our money back because we were scheduled to check in the same day so we would have lost over $3000. On our flight back from Montego Bay, our flight kept getting delayed and delayed. It was delayed 5 times!!! While sitting in the airport, there were several people who's flights were cancelled and they had been stuck in the airport for 2 and 3 days because American Airlines kept cancelling their flights! After finally getting on our flight (3 hours later) we ended up missing our connecting flight because of the delays. Of course, we had to stay in a hotel and they gave us $24 worth of food vouchers (for a 24 hour period) Not only did we miss our connecting flight, they rebooked us on a flight the next day to Philadelphia. There would have been another layover for several hours (7 to be exact) and then we would have had to fly to Atlanta from there. Good knows what would have happened or how many times that flight would have gotten delayed. We ended up getting a direct flight instead but the flight didn't leave until 9:30 the next night. The customer service was horrible and we will never, ever, ever, fly American!!!!!!! DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES!!!!! Save yourself the time, heartache, and money and just fly Delta!"
240,Wow!! I cannot believe how rude this airline‚Äôs staff is. Tried to do the right thing and canceled my flight last year after testing positive for COVID. Should have just been selfish like everyone else and went ahead and kept my plans. Using my voucher has been totally impossible. I was hung up on by a manager named Ben in Phoenix this evening after being  on the phone for over 1 hour.
241,"They are the worst service Rudest service,no help. Airline steward name JoJo was rude was coughing didn‚Äôt wear a mask and was sweating if you were sick he should‚Äôve been taking off the airline Rudest servants in attendance it will not help you my flight was canceled did not want to reimburse you .You take your flight As is."
242,"Worst airline ever!!! We get to the airport early get checked in and then the wait began! Our flight was delayed 12 times! Then they told us they swapped out the plane and it would be here in 10 mins. We‚Äôll 5 mins after that we all got a message that our flight was canceled after waiting hours!!! We knew before the gate agents knew. They timed out on flight hours! We had to have our family member come get us which was a 40 min drive. I called customer service to rebook and they only had a flight from Tucson to Phoenix the next night. We would then have to go from Phoenix to North Carolina to get back home to FL. We got on our flight from Tucson to Phoenix and landed. Turned on my phone to have received a message that our next flights were canceled yet again!! They could have told us that in Tucson and not even get on that flight! We were stuck in Phoenix. Waited in line at the customer service line for almost two hours to get another flight. I couldn‚Äôt even hear the customer service rep who wouldn‚Äôt even look me in the eye when she talked to me. Her other co worker saunter‚Äôs up and they start laughing and joking and having a good ol time while ignoring me. She finally turns back to me to tell me there are no more flights for the night that they can get us out the next day at 7:10 pm and then have a 9 hour layover in Dallas!! I lost it and started crying. She just looked at me and said that‚Äôs all I can do. Once I gained my composure I asked her to check other airlines and she immediately said no one has a flight. I watched her, she didn‚Äôt even check!! I told her fine we want our bags and we will look ourselves! She said it would take two hours to get our bags. Ok fine whatever I just want my bags! She told us to go to baggage claim. Ok great we head that way and they had it closed off and we had to walk to the other side of the airport to access baggage claim. We didn‚Äôt see our flight on any of the carousel so I had to go to their baggage claim customer service to be told it could be 5 hours till we get our bags!!!!  It was 10pm at this time and I was just done and wanted to go but no we had to wait for our bags so we could have our stuff. The baggage claim people were the only ones who were decent to us the whole time. We finally got our bags after three hours and had to have our family members drive to Phoenix to pick us up over two hours from where they live. I will never and I mean ever use this airline again!! They keep saying their flights are being timed out or it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù issue and if that is truly the case they need to stop offering  the later flights if they can‚Äôt staff them! They canceled 27 flights last night!! Never again!!!"
243,"My baggage went missing 27th May 2022, no one will respond to request for assistance, all forms completed. On the rare occasion you speak to someone you get different stories and then they put you on hold and then disconnect. Still no suitcase"
244,"First, I leave Sky Harbor on June 7 2022 towards Philadelphia and the lady who checked me in was RUDE!!! LIKE EXTREMELY RUDE! She didint even let me speak when asing questions..... When I fly back from Puerto Rico to Miami on June 112022, I almost missed my second flight due to wrong programing of the flight. Thankfully we got there early and didnt miss that flight. Also, all seats were given separately to my husband and myself when asked to have then TOGETHER. In the Philadelphia Airport I asked to get a seat assigned and the attendant was also RUDERRR THAN THE OTHER.üö®üö® HIRE REPS WHO CARE AND WOULD MAKE AN EXPERIENCE A GOOD ONE. YOU TICKETS ARE NOT CHEAP. ALSO GIVE BETTER SNACKS. I THINK WE PAY FOR BETTER QUALITY OF SNACKS!!Lastly when leaving LATE TO PHX SKY HARBOR AT 648PM TODAY 06/11/2022. THE ATTENDANT CHANGED MY SEATS AGAIN BC MY HUSBAND DOESN NOT KNW ENGLISH HE CANNOT BE IN THE EMERGENCY EXIT. SO AMERICAN AIRLINES IS RACIST?? IM BEYOND WORDS.

ATTENDANT ASKS ME IF IM OK BEING IN AN EMERGENCY LANE WHICH I HAVE NEVER DONE AND THOUGHT HE WAS JOKING SO LAUGHED. EMBARACING!!!

246,"The only good thing I have to say is that the planes are very comfortable. But that‚Äôs all. My husband and I had our return flight home to Las Vegas booked out of Miami for 6/10 at approximately 6:30pm. Our flight was delayed due to ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù repeatedly every 30-45 mins from 5:30p until 8:30p. Then they reassigned our plane and gate and updated us to a 9:40pm departure. We were given very minimal information during this time. Finally at 11pm, they advised us that they no longer had a pilot and would be cancelling the flight. They sent us to the rebooking counter, which had a two hour wait to be helped. When we finally got to the counter at 1am, almost every flight to get us home was already booked because, as our gate attendant advised us, WE waited too long to adjust our flights. We requested compensation and we‚Äôre not offered any. Instead they directed us to EMAIL customer service (which we did and received an automated response for a 7-10 business day or longer response during peak travel times). The gate ‚Äúmanager‚Äù offered us two $12 meal vouchers for the ADDITIONAL DAY of travel - one of which did not work when we went to use it. Finally, we inquired about a hotel for the evening, but they were ‚Äúsold out‚Äù because we (once again) ‚Äúwaited too long.‚Äù We were offered to book our own room and receive a $150 reimbursement - good luck finding a hotel room in Miami at 1am on a Friday for that price! My husband and I were able to rebook our flights - but all the nonstop were unavailable (which was what we originally booked to get home to our two children - 2.5 and 8months) - so they gave us a ticket which included a 7 hour layover. At every turn no employee was interested in making it right. They were rude. Unhelpful. They acted as if we created the problem and should find our own solution. This was just unacceptable. Period."
247,I been flying 3 flights with American airlines and every flight has been held up for maintenance issues and all they do is stand front on plane tell jokes and you can hear them saying how they love holding up travel.....think it's think  Americans goes out of business......if can t stay on time and keep maintenance up then airport s should kick them out.....been on a plane over hour and they up front telling jokes about presit...    I highly don't recommend American airlines if you have a job or something needs done....they just don't care........
248,Absolutely dreadful‚Ä¶we drove 3 hrs at night to arrive at the airport only for them to cancel our flights last minute! The first time we tried calling customer service to get our flights changed (since our flight got delayed/rescheduled 3 days!!! ) they didn‚Äôt even try to help us! On top of that we found out we couldn‚Äôt even get a refund because our tickets were basic economy‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt even try American or spirit imo. They‚Äôll screw you over and rob you
249,Waiting on my son all day he's been stuck at airport for the last three hours delayed. Now they are on the plane and noones taking off because the pilots aren't showing up. This is the worst . He traveled on credits that he got because they messed up his last flight a month ago. Never again
250,"We spent 15 hours in airports to make one connecting flight home. To be fair, weather delays caused issues at the beginning of the trip which are out of anyone‚Äôs control. Then, our connecting flight had 11 delays for reasons not explained to us; only after probing did we learn the reason, mechanical problems. The departure time kept getting continually bumped back arbitrarily, causing confusion, artificially inflated hopes, and the expectation that alternate arrangements would not be need to be made. Over the course of this time I witnessed an agent lose his patience with upset customers and all electronic boarding passes had to be exchanged for printed passes at midnight because they would no longer function. I am very disappointed with the blatant lack of transparency and customer service which demonstrate a low regard for their customers. I will not be flying with American Airlines again."
251,Do NOT give any business to American Airlines. I had wet clothes and laptop plus and arrived 7 hours later than I was supposed to without an apology or anything other than file a complaint online for baggage and 7500 miles.
252,"I want to Preface this review by saying that we are American airlines members and pay monthly for this service‚Ä¶.. We had a flight booked for Washington that was going to connect with an international Airline and fly to Istanbul then Italy. We checked our bags and got on the flight and sat on a plane that did not move for two hours, after this they came and told us that there was no pilot and we had to get off the flight and attempt to reschedule. The only option they gave us was a different connecting flight and we did not want to take it. After we declined we wanted to get our bags that we had checked and the man said that they are downstairs and that he‚Äôs not allowed to go down there and that the people downstairs were not answering the phone so we waited a couple more hours and ended up leaving after they wouldn‚Äôt give us our bags and said they would try to find a flight in the morning. Our bags ended up getting flown to Washington without us and initially they did not know where our bags went so we couldn‚Äôt go to Washington and get them and we lost our international tickets from the other airline with no refund, lost our rental car in Italy with no refund and had to buy new items like clothes to try and travel that weekend, and were not reimbursed for any of that. They also gave us Economy class ticket refunds when we bought business class so we lost money on the flight as well."
253,"Sitting in the plane: flight cancelled !!During a stopover, after having delayed by 1:30, make us sit in the plane 2 hours without a pilot and then they cancel the flight !!! It's 11 p.m., (we were supposed to be at our destination at 10:20 p.m.) they send us to a far Hotel, in the city, by taxi, dont pay us for any meal at night (I'm pregnant), to sleep for 2 hours because they put us back on a flight at 5:49am. No taxi found to bring us back at the airport at 3:00am.  The new booking is a flight with a stopover to replace the only flight we had left to do;  we will be home more than 12 hours later, hungry and tired!"
254,"American Airlines moved us onto a different return flight to the one booked with no notification. Only happened to find out thanks to our checking in early.  No answer on customer services phone number. New flight was 12 hours earlier than the one we booked and to a different airport so on top of losing a day of our holiday, we had to spend a lot of money amending other travel arrangements. No apology, no compensation offered. Really disappointing and a sour end to our holiday. We will never book with them again."
255,"Suitcase was lost in my travel to Pereira, Colombia. American Airlines will not reimburse me as no claim number exists.  The American Airlines agent in Colombia provided me with documents reflecting the loss; however, he did not generate a claim number which American Airlines is now requesting.  I have provided AA with all the completed documents provided by their agent; however, American Airlines will not reimburse me because it is policy and procedure that without a claim number reimbursement cannot be completed. I am disappointed in AA's handling of this incident when their own employee did not comply with their policy and procedures."
256,"I am extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with the lack of compassion, care, curtsey, respect, customer service, and honor American Arlines and government TSA have for people especially at Chicago o hare airport, we flew in fromJamaica to Chicago o hare- yes it was 25-30 min early- but we only had an hour in a half between two flights to get through about 2,000 people in customers, once through that check point we which took an hour just in line, we had to find our bag amongst hundreds of bags took about ten min just to find baggage and another ten to find our bag, then had to get in another check point line had about fifty people in front of us, then they closed our lane and re routed us to another lane which added another 25 people in front of us, that took almost an hour just to get through that line had to find where to drop off bag, then had to find a tram to drive us to the terminal all this cutting us 10 min before the flight closed, got to their terminal the signs are misleading got to the TSA check point it was closed went back towards the other direction asked a worker where the gate was had five people in front of us, got through, my husband has to sit to put his shoes on he is handicapped from a bad accident he almost lost his life from so we‚Äôre trying to walk as fast as we can to the gate he can‚Äôt run he was already having trouble walking fast breathing, we get about a mile down the long hallway which our gate was the very last one. No one there but a lady sitting in a chair I asked her if she worked there, she said yes, the gate 18 is closed have to go to gate 8 to get another flight, plane still there can we get on- no they shut the doors, go stand in line 15 min the plane sat there, we could have been in our seat, our luggage on the plan we checked in‚Ä¶ supposedly, get to talk to lady at gate 8, no flights out till Monday- it was sat evening, we have kids and work, can‚Äôt do, have to do rental care to get home, they wouldn‚Äôt give us a refund, wouldn‚Äôt get us a hotel room, no food vouchers- nothing but well it‚Äôs your fault and the governments fault not ours, called costumer service same answer, spent over $1,000.00 more than we planned to over this mess, luckily while they were giving us the run around my just married husband and I went online and got a car, because when we got to the car lot they were sold out unless you reserved one, just to get to the car lot was a mess, this poor older couple group went to get on the tram to get to the car lot, we were following a worker because we didn‚Äôt know where anything was, the team was closed , we didn‚Äôt know what to do , I follow the worker and ask him while he is briskly walking to get to his destination, my poor husband behind because he can‚Äôt breath from all the running around, find out which bus to get on, I asked the old people where they were going, they were going to same place so I told them to follow us. Then I had my aunt back in our home town stop at the Fort Wayne airport when our flight was there to get our bag- no bag- we are on hold for three hours to talk to baggage claim for them to say I think it is here and I think this is we‚Äôre it will go and when, we can‚Äôt find our bag we have been to the airport three times this last time sitting for four hours only to be told we don‚Äôt know where it is- it has my husbands cpap machine and our daily must have medicine on it among other things we need. So long story short American Airlines and the government better fork up a lot of money if they do not want this to go any further and want me to take this post down, I hope more people stand up to how horrible they are and seek justice- I want &500,000.00 American dollars tax free to make this couple happy. This was our honeymoon and you all have lost my respect. Melissa Harper.  PNC Bank route # 071921891 account # 4699489134 for wire transfer # 041000124 - I hope you look into this and start working on teaching your workers, care, respect, compassion, curtesy, honor, and better customer service. Man at Taco Bell we stopped at could tell we were having a bad night and apologized even though he had nothing to do with it and gave us a coupon for a free taco- that is the best service we have had on our whole trip and we were driving home. I can only imagine the other poor souls that have to deal with this Baloney. And we still have not got our luggage, sitting in airport in Fort Wayne 4 hours and also on the phone with customer service for American Airlines for 4+ hours waiting to find out we‚Äôre our luggage is. I also had a severe allergic reaction on my face and had to go to the hospital after we finally got our bag after waiting 4 hours- never did get connected with customer service on the phone sitting there for the 4 hours.

257,"I purchased 2 overseas airline ticket with American airline for $1,700, then in order to travel 12 hours like a human being I upgraded for an additional $213 to seats with more space. Somehow because of the way they fool and deceive you on the website ON PURPOSE, I didn‚Äôt realize these were non refundable even though that was a top priority while purchasing. Because of Covid we ended up having to cancel the trip. For a year and a half, I have been trying to use up my credit with this airline but they credit you in such a way that it‚Äôs like a black hole. You can NEVER actually use all your money at once, you can never get your money back and you end up constantly having to buy new tickets for only a portion of the credit you should get, and having more left that can‚Äôt be used together. Bottom line, I have $527 that I paid American airlines and I just can‚Äôt get it back unless I make 3 NEW purchases. Money in the garbage! Very unfortunate for me, and for them as well, because we travel a lot and I will not spend 1 dollar till the day I die with them! Do they care? Of course not. Sad but true!"
258,"I am happy with the service, but AA should realize that the seats cannot get much narrower and smaller. It is becoming uncomfortable for many to sit down in a tight space for a long flight. I remember reading about how airlines are boosting profitability by putting more seats in planes - this can only go up to a limit before people become very uncomfortable."
259,Absolutely terrible. My child‚Äôs flight was canceled because they don‚Äôt have pilots. I see my kid 5 weeks a year and after booking him a flight months ago they cancel it 1 hour before the flight. Terrible
260,If I could give negative stars I would. How do you delay a flight because you don't have pilots but then get pilots who don't have enough flight time to complete the flight? Three pilots didn't even mention that until they were also telling us they were turning us around because of a storm that they didn't have fuel to go around. Why was the plane not fueled completely? I'll never fly AA again. First and absolute LAST TIME! I'd ride a Schwinn to my destination before I bought a ticket from them. Pathetic. One more thing...a flight attendant got in a woman's face because she was talking to someone in her traveling party expressing her feelings about the situation. The people's removed the lady and her party but fine nothing to the flight attendant although she was at fault smh. I guess good service means putting your finger in someone's face that wasn't even talking to you.
261,"After multiple experiences and flights with this airline, I can definitely attest to the fact that they are crap. Terrible customer service, constant flight delays and cancelations, terrible planes that don't have near the accommodations or upkeep as other airlines, the list goes on. Expect terrible service and expect to get to your destination anywhere from 12 to 36 hours late. Speaking from multiple experiences here."
262,"The worst airlines and staff possible ..horrible service , lack of any support- help -empathy or any professional approaches .. terrible expiriences during my flight with small dog 9 lbs weight poodle üê© no any help before or during ordered flight very unkind bad service before and during flight chicago - Fort Meyers on Sunday 8.57 am which was changed suddenly to 10.20 am than suddenly back to 9.10 am than they again moved me and my poor dog to flight 12.22pm than moved to 12.40 pm not allowing even take out for moment my poor scared thirsty  small dog from crate which they in chicago airport ( 4 persons incuding extremely rude unkind guy ) asked me to  change to difrent one crate ( not accepting the one I was travel and use many times on other lines )without any normal acceptable reason .. lack of any knowledge , kindness , professionalism - all AA staff in chicago - worst possible - no any help understanding or any kind support very unprofessional rude bad service ..I expect any explanation from AA at least after horror I went trough together w my poor dog charging me whatever I was asked not even suggesting any help .scandalous !!!

263,"Third World service at First World prices. This company enjoys an oligopoly within the US that protects its bottom line despite being one of the worst airlines in the World. Delays, garbage food, awful customer service. You can choose!"
264,"By far, the WORST airline I have ever flown with. ABSOLUTELY A F**cking MESS! Do not, under ANY circumstance, fly with them. They are a pathetic mess. They will delay your flights, make you loose connections, loose your checked bags, and don‚Äôt give a damn if they return them back to you. They are just a f**cking mess. Not worth the money or the time. Absolute joke of a company!"
265,Even third world countries such as India's bus service is better than this third class service. Ripped seats on a world's busiest route London to New York and local service in the US is a complete kiosk and poor too.
266,"On May 19, 2022, my wife and I were nearly the last to board a full flight (561 Phoenix to Portland, OR). We thought there would probably be no chance of sitting together...until agent, Paul came toward us and explained that he 'worked it out' that we could be at least a row apart. We boarded to seats 9A and 10B respectively and found 9B still empty. Shortly, a very tall woman came and seated herself in 9B. When I asked her if she would consider swapping with my wife in 10B, she jumped at the chance (more legroom in the exit row). Please acknowledge 'Paul's' kindness to us!!"
267,"Today 05/27/2022Guys don‚Äôt fly with American Airlines please, it is too much delay, and no one is responds in LaGuardia airport New York"
268,"This is by far the worst airline to fly with. Customer service is unhelpful, rude and unprofessional. Our flight was delayed, then canceled and customer service did nothing to help us find a new flight. Issued credit is useless if there are no flights. I will never fly American Airlines again"
269,Sad. Trip booked and planned with my son for months. What do they do? Seat us 4 rows apart. But wait if we want to pay $97 each they can find a way to seat us together. I‚Äôll look for any alternative to this airline going forward.
270,I was on a multiple carrier international trip. First leg St. Louis to O'Hara. I checked in paid extra for my bags no one told me the flight was delayed an hour. If the had I would have to United flight left 20 minutes after the American flight was scheduled. No I checked in went through security Sat down at gate then I get the email. Ok I can still make my next flight. No another email add another half hour. Now I have 25 minutes to wait for bags and change terminals. Then the plane didn't depart for twenty minutes more. No hotel. No help making reservations or offer to pay extras fees. Norhing.
271,"My flight was delayed for 14 hours. We stayed inside the hot plane for 8 hours straight. No compensation, not even a sorry."
272,"Not 1 flight on time.  They leave late, land late. Will never fly American again"
273,They canceled my flight 10:25 and because I am not a member of there rewards. I have to wait until 4:30 cutting my time with my family 6 hours. Thanks American Airlines. I want be flying with you no more
274,"We booked return flights in March for travel in July from UK to US. AA then changed the flight dates and times on 5 separate occasions, without any explanation.Going through an agent made it even more challenging as the agent did not have access to all the alternative flights on their system, in addition to the ""you need to contact the airline"" / ""you need to talk to the agent"" ping pong.On the 5th change AA could not provide a suitable alternative to the outbound flight or any assurance that there would not be further changes, so we cancelled and went direct to Virgin.Oh and just to add insult to injury it takes 30 days for AA to process a refund."
275,"one of the worst airlines in the worldthey overbook every single flight then start to offer vouchers to volunteers to bump them out when everybody shows up .the boarding and un boarding take fore ever because of lack of spaces for overhead compartments, then when there is a delay or anything, good luck finding places for all the over booked people, starting to place them apart in different seats and non-direct flights opposed to their original bookings, and refusal to hand people vouchers when they cancel a flight or the first flight miss the connection, what a shameful company we used to Rever and love"
276,"So my flight into St. Louis was really bad , Was put next to a drug attic .. I felt very unsafe , so on my return flight I ask to be moved to the front . I would just like to feel safe on Flight 4246 , but The Man the was working was very rude and called another woman that had ask to get her seat as was help . As for me .. not one word .. I will never flight AA again .."
277,I had the worst flight in My life.im 68 year old I'm handicap.i bought leg room seat and they gave me the seat in back of the plane in the middle seat.im 6.  5. I wouldn't fly with aa again if they paid me
278,"The London flight was delayed by 3 hours. First we were told due to maintenance requirements, then they were waiting for crew to show up, then they were waiting for the food to be loaded even though we had seen this being done an hour earlier. The loading gate was in complete chaos as no loading announcement was made. When we finally boarded the captain made an announcement the three would be a delay leaving the gate as they were waiting for food which we had bee  told was being loaded much earlier. The flight was cramped, the crew so so and the toilets smelling like a public urinal from where we were sitting. As for food, dont bother it was inedible the worse we have ever had.They just did not seem to know what happening at CLT and we will not be travelling AA again"
279,"I tried to get a flight change for my wife and my 2 year old granddaughter to match the added cost ($65) that my daughter received via an email, vs. what is available to them ($213 per passenger).  I spoke to customer service and their internet dept., but was told that those offers are ""computer generated"", and can't be generated by a human.  Both dept. supervisors refused to speak to me, so our 3 flyers will be camping out in Dallas for a 12 hour layover vs. the offered 1 hour, with dozens of available seats showing on the short layover flight.  Yes, I was asking for special assistance, but their was nothing offered, beside an opportunity to take a 1 question survey . . . All in all, a very disappointing experience!"
280,"The worst customer service. American Airlines not only decided to just change our already booked/paid afternoon flight for an early morning flight (5:30am) but they also wanted to charge us more money to get a later flight. To add insult, on the flight home the agent at the terminal insisted that there wasn‚Äôt room for more over head bags and requested we check our bags. So we did however once we entered the airplane there was plenty of overhead storage. The flight attendants told us it was too late to get our bags and then we stayed grounded for another 30 minutes. Not sure if it‚Äôs staff incompetence or poor company policies or what, but we will never fly nor recommend American Airlines"
281,"Unfortunately, a once trusted airline service has lost my respect as a customer. American Airlines gave me Trip Credit for a cancellation which could be ""credited to a future reservation"". I purchased a ticket for my mom, and when I tried to apply the Trip credit to another reservation, I was completely denied because of ""name change"" policy. As the purchaser, and having the ticket billed under my name, I should have ownership over the credit (you would think). After waiting an hour to speak with Candy Mack, I was simply told to email Customer Relations to file a complaint. And although, I purchased trip insurance through the American Airlines website, the third party Allianz insurance provider is a separate entity that I will have to contact for a refund. They are conveniently not answering their customer service line. Update: A month later Customer Relations changed the status of my trip credit so I can apply it under my name. In summary, Just keep pushing customer service until you get what you need."
282,"If I could give them 0 stars I would, but unfortunately you have to choose at least one. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. The representatives talk to you as if you were bothering them. The people I know who have booked with American before, told me it is the worst airline, but I had never had bad experiences so I used to say that it was great. After today I agree with them, they have the worst customer service."
283,"I'm grading this on a curve. Out of all of the airlines out there, AA is not the worst one. They are a little above average, hence the 4/5 stars. They nickel and dime you on everything but, so does every other airline. They aren't Emirates, or even Turkish but, they are far better than Spirit or frontier."
284,"Some airlines just never learn. At terminal 3 departures. Queue backed up, 4 desks open out of 10! Shocking! Irate customers standing in the queue fir an hour.Stop treating your customers with contempt AA, show a little respect!"
285,"FORGET ALL ABOUT FLYING AMERICAN AIRLINES.Worst customer service ever.Long haul flight, 2 persons, same PNR number but not seated together.But loads af free seats, if we would PAY extra to sit together.DISGUSTING."
286,"Flight from Nashville to Chicago to connect with overnight flight to London on Saturday. Change time was quite tight, but then a delay was announced, making the change almost impossible. This was due to ‚Äòbad weather in Chicago‚Äô. Then The flight was cancelled. Gate rep totally useless. Gave us a card with a number to ring. After 45 minutes on a mobile we were booked on a flight via jfk the next day. No apology, no offer of food or accommodation. On the flight cabin crew could not raise a smile or pleasant word between them. Food awful. Avoid"
287,"I will not fly AA again.  First, they cram you onboard like sardines and the seats absolutely suck and, it never fails the person sitting next to me takes up their seat and part of mine as well.  Not because they are a lot larger than me but because the seats are very narrow. The seats are designed for children not adults.  The second thing that is sorry about AA is they offer you to pay for your check on luggage online but when you get to the airport to check your bag/s, it does not show you prepaid online. Your bank alerts that you did but not the counter check in.  They force you to pay at the counter or you will have to leave your bag/s behind. They then make it impossible to contact them when you arrive at your destination, so that you can get a refund for the over charge. By the time you make it through the refund process on their site, your time expires, and you must start over. After several times of this you finally give up. AA has now successfully stolen your baggage fees with little recourse for you to get a refund. I had to contact my card provider to dispute the charges and am now waiting to receive my refund. Where I come from, they call that theft. Flying is an unpleasant experience now as it is, but AA ensures you will be further dissatisfied by stealing from you. I know my not flying with them won't put a dent in their bottom line but I will never again fly AA."
288,"Called the number for customer service. Was on hold for 20 minutes, and then the line went dead. Woeful."
289,"Do not fly American - we've flown on some poor airlines in the past, but American has to be the worst of all. Too many examples of poor customer service to list here but some highlights include:Check in: I don't begrudge anyone who is willing to spend the extra for first or business class although if you are thinking about it, I wouldn't with this airline!! but AA should really have a priority check queue especially for those passengers, they shouldn't allow the ‚Äúpriority passengers‚Äù just to walk to the front of the economy queue as they arrive leaving the ""lower classes"" including many families that have been standing at the front of the queue for an hour watching on!! You can't imagine how frustrating this was and how irate the other passengers were getting - there was very nearly an uprising!Seating: even though you might think that you as a family have seats booked together and this is clearly shown on the plan of the plane on the AA website - don't rely on this, the check in staff think otherwise and will place you in random places on the plane when you arrive at the airport - we as a family of four were split up on all of our flights, on one particular flight it would seem that the rows of empty seats at the back were required for the cabin crew who needed 3 each to sprawl across whilst having soft drinks and pretzels and watching their iPads, the cabin crew are obviously overworked and need time to relax! The cabin crew aren't very accommodating at resolving these sort of issues and you just have to get on with it. Cancelled flights - our flight out of JFK to San Jose was cancelled meaning we missed a day of our holiday, no help was forthcoming as the ground staff basically couldn't be bothered, better airlines got passengers hotel rooms and gave meal vouchers but not American! I know this as we met several other passengers in our hotel in one of the less than pleasant ends of JFK airport, (Probably one of the last ones available as the better ones obviously booked out by the better airlines that care about customer service) We had to ask our travel agent to find a flight for AA to book us on to the next day, aa Ground staff weren't keen to help us out with this and acted like they had done us a big favour! Air Traffic control congestion is the lame excuse that has been offered as a reason for the cancelled flight but I don‚Äôt see how this can be an unforeseen event as they must operate the same schedule on a regular basis and the other airlines with a similar issue were obviously more accommodating to their customers, needless to say compensation hasn‚Äôt been forthcoming. From what I‚Äôve read on here cancelling flights is all too common for AA so I guess you just have to book and cling on to some sort of hope that you might reach your destination on at some point. Baggage: Very mixed messages about this from AA, on our outbound flight, check in staff at Heathrow said that our bags would transit through JFK to our final destination of San Jose and we wouldn't see them but I think it's a bit of a gamble! As our outbound connecting flight was cancelled our bags had been dumped off the carousel and were waiting for us at JFK (and were waiting for us for quite some time as we stood in massive queues due to very limited staff at immigration and quite a lengthy process to gain entry in a country that we weren't even technically visiting)On our return journey we were told that our bags would go straight through to our final destination (Heathrow) only to be told on the plane that we had to collect them and then take them to a bag drop for further scrutiny - this resulted in waiting at half an hour waiting for the bags to arrive and preparing to stand in another queue only to find out that as we were transiting through the airport to an international flight our bags had already been transferred! I think it's a bit of a gamble what happens and you just have to play it by ear -  ground staff at AA don't seem to really know what's going on! Poor communication in any caseThere has to be a better alternative to flying with American and I would urge you to explore all options before booking any flights with this dreadful excuse for an airline, our experience was awful and our story sadly similar to so many others on here."
290,Flight from Chicago to LondonMy family a member of Four had to sit in 4 different places on the planeNot great in a Corona pandemic
291,"The AA website is screwball to the average human.  It must be.  I'm a webmaster and it took me 2 HOURS to view my mileage!  Then the agent on the phone said to click on the FEEDBACK button on the right navigation bar, and I spent another 10 mins. telling him it doesn't appear on the public's site.  NO, IT'S NOT THE BROWSER.  I'd rather keep this confidential with my suggestions how to make their site pages less cumbersome.  A REGULAR SERVICE REP. DOES NOT UNDERSTAND TECHNICAL LANGUAGE.  POS."
292,"All American Airlines vouchers credits have expired on March 31, BEFORE Covid pandemic was over, and it was safe to fly! Now, company is sitting on billions of dollars of customers money without providing any services! Shame on you!! These vouchers are useless right now! My family had to cancel two vacations booked with AA, lost thousands of dollars! Just so CEOs of the company can be enriched from this situation! Taking advantage of American people during this Covid pandemic for personal wealth. That was they do!"
293,If you want a company who adds layovers to your direct flights you payed additional for without asking and then said layover gets cancelled and they leave you high and dry with no accommodations and blame you for not rebooking the flight when the layover was added and then their customer service agents will ask if ‚Äúyou want to fight them‚Äù when you were not in the slightest being hostile with them this is the airline for you. Worst customer service I have ever encountered.
294,"This was our first time flying out of IAH to ATL and we ended up with a stop in DFW. Weather came and shut that down which is understandable and out of their control. However from then on it just got worse. The flights kept getting delayed until eventually getting pushed back, we were trying to go to another airline or airport and couldn't find one in time. They rescheduled us for another flight and we told them we'll get a hotel (which they don't cover if due to weather, again semi understandable) we get to the carousel and wait and turns out they shipped our bags out to our final destination. Mind you we have a long layover tomorrow and now have NONE of our stuff even after advising them we want it. We tried to reach the support line and the wait is literally 1 hour and 38 minutes. This was my first and last experience with American."
295,"The worst online booking, the agent can never help you, after the company advertised something and the customer trying to resolve the problem with Priceline and AA mess-up errors. Keeps getting the run round and that they cannot help, the company is quick to collect your money however when their issues and the problem is out of the customer control and want to cancel and get a refund they cannot help. The worst company to do business with."
296,"I'm so done with Covid excuses.  Purchased an airline ticket through Cheap-O-Air in March 2020 for a summer vacation.  No communication from Cheap-O-Air or American Airlines regarding length on ticket extensions.  The location which we've been waiting to vacation (Hawaii) has finally opened back up (without significant restrictions), so we are trying to redeem our credits.   Cheap-O-Air claims they've called AA and informed my credit has expired., I've called AA on 2 different occasions and was told AA has extended credit to the end of 2022 if you book by Sept 30th.  So after failing with Cheap-O-Air for a 2nd time, I called AA again and now this agent basically tells me because the ticket was issued by a third party, they will not tell them to extend credit.  Never again will I use any 3rd party or AA.  $1,600+ of my family's money was stolen.  They are thieves with empty apologies."
297,"Long story short. Flights from Munich to Cancun and back. On the way to Cancun one of my connecting flights was canceled out of nowhere. 'Luckyly' my final flight was delayed so at least i was able to get catch it after the customer service rebooked me. Still this was very stressful. On the way back the real nightmare occurred. I had to enter and leave the airplane 3 times due to technical difficulties. This led to me missing my final flight home. So they rebooked me for a flight where i arrive !!!!37!!!!! Hours later then planned with one additional transit and one stay at a shabby hotel. To add insult to injury, they gave me a rediculois 12 $ voucher so i cold get something to eat for the additional 26 hours i would have to stay at the airport.So to sum it up: total delay of around 40h hours back and forth, one stay at a cheap hotel, a 12$ food voucher and no compensation whatsoever i dearly warn you DON'T TRAVEL INTERNATIONAL WITH AMERICAN AIRWAIS."
298,"This airline is awful. Customer service line is a premium rate, long waits for help, double charged for baggage and generally very bad attitude. Never book with this airline."
299,Been on hold for 47 minutes and counting! Awful experience. The most unaccommodating Airline company ever.
300,Every Flight is constantly delayed.  No answer on when we can leave. No compensation.  This is the 5th delayed flight in a month.. 2nd delayed flight today alone! Horrible experience.
301,Cabin crew very good attentive professional on flights comfy seat food quite good
302,Worst flight ever Palm Beach to Charlotte delayed 2 1/2 hours missed connecting flight by 5 minutes customer service desk was a joke.  Had to fly to alternate airport 2 hrs. from home.  AA offered no help or restitution for all issues.  Will not fly AA again unless no other alternative.
303,"DO NOT BOOK THIS AIRLINEDo not book this airline unless you want your baggage to either be delayed or lost. This is the worst airline I have even flown with. And every time we call the airline they tell us different information about ur baggage. We flew from Dallas to Canc√∫n the 14th of April 2022, but haven‚Äôt received our baggage  yet on the 16th. When we call to hear about the case, they either tell us that it has arrived in Canc√∫n already, haven‚Äôt been sent from Dallas, or due to the DELAY ON THE FLIGHT, haven‚Äôt made the flight going to Canc√∫n in the first place. EVERY time we call it‚Äôs a different story. WORST experience! So if you wouldn‚Äôt like your baggage your entire vacation and would like a delay on your flight - go ** ahead. Book this airline. I certainly will never again."
304,"Just travelled to the USA from the Uk and returned 2 weeks later. Although covid issues caused some delays at the airport, AA web site and the verify app made the experience less painful. Flight staff were excellent and polite and made the journey as comfortable as possible. After an absence of 3 years since our last visit to family in the USA due to covid the whole experience was overall good. Thank you AA"
305,"We'll fly a commited airline instead, or stay home. We have a max of 9 years left to make our global future semi-safe... AA will not be part of our future. They're a ""legit"" airline in that they do operate their flights (for now). Their service our case of late flights and a missed connection was not good. Long story: Their flight from NY was delayed by two hours due to weather. Happens all the time now, so no biggie.  A bundle of customers, including families, were told to run (indeed!) to their connecting gate. They did so to find it had closed boarding five minutes early ""not to miss their flight slot"". Too bad. This happens on a Wednesday evening. Next connection from DFW to SAF, that they could put them on, ""is on Saturday"". Wait, what...?! In fact, Southwestern fly the same leg barely two hours later from DAL, a mere 20min by taxi! (Pricewise, for your overnight hotel... flightwise, would've been less kerosine burned and a lot less stress.)Instead of letting their customers know, they promise they will fly them to SaF ""next morning"" (11am, in fact!) from Phoenix, where they have to now fly overnight and ""will receive a hotel voucher on arrival"".After another hour delay (now waiting for more stragglers despite bad weather) they arrive in PHX at MIDNIGHT. Only to hear local gate operator say ""we NEVER pay for hotels if weather is the cause"" and hand him a flyer with a QR code that every traveling website offers. Plus: Got on that plane to SAF eventually and did not crash in stormy conditions.  Onboard staff acted decent enough. Minus: Stressful, wasteful way to travel, just to ""save"" a few $$. Way below standard we're used to from traveling with any even half-serious airline in Europe. A day lost in needless criss-cross transits, little sleep, and we paid for the hotel, too. Fazit: We will not fly them again. Avoid booking a connecting flight with them. Stay home if you can, if not, try to fly a committed airline. Thoughts: An airline makes their money by ruining our global climate for decades and then cries wolf when, inevitably, weather begins to turn less decent as a result? Their pricing policy must be very off reality indeed. We will not stand for that any longer!"
306,"Non existent customer serviceFamily of five returning from us to UK via Madrid on AACrazy Spanish rules 're. Covid means that transit via Madrid requires additional forms for return flights that are not required on outbound. For outbound no requirements for transit if under 18. But for inbound need covid vaccination documentation even if under 18 according to AA. Spanish ""spTH"" website the worst I have ever seen. AA attitude  --  not our problem since flight was BA code shareHaving missed flight had to 're book on BA where customer service was much better"
307,"I have traveled for years and American used to be a good Airlines, now they are strait garbage. I booked a round trip ticket overseas and while there got sick and the day before departure called and they said when I got better call them and they would issue a travel credit. They did not and kept all my money. They do not care if a person gets covid and charge for everything... Do not use American Airlines if you want secure travel plans because they will mess you over."
308,AA has lost my luggage both times I have flown with them. NEVER AGAIN. Lesson learned.
309,"I have been a long-term flyer with American airlines because they go to one of the locations in the United States that I travel to frequently and usually have the best schedule for flights there. I also have an American Airlines credit card and enjoy different perks because of my frequent flying.Nonetheless, I‚Äôm leaving this review here because I have found that I cannot trust the service that I receive over the phone with American Airlines service representatives.Specifically, I have had three instances in the last year where a flight was canceled or I had a problem with the online booking and so I had to call their toll-free number.  in these cases, the agent seemed helpful and told me that they had rescheduled a flight or booked a flight however after the phone call and after I gave them a top rating on the phone after the call, I found out that they had not actually booked the flight or did what they said they did and then I had to call back again and go through the whole long process to make sure that indeed I would be booked on the flight that originally they said they booked me for. One person was very rude to me and when I told her she didn‚Äôt seem very empathetic she told me she doesn‚Äôt cry about every customers problem is what she literally said, and then she threatened to transfer me.I filled out American airlines online complaint form, but it‚Äôs been about two weeks and no one has gotten back to me.If you do have a problem booking a flight or a flight is canceled and you need to call American Airlines, I recommend that you ask for the record locator number of whatever action they say they have accomplished for you and while you are still on the phone with them go on the app or go online and enter that record locator number just to confirm that what they did shows up in the system.  The last time I had to call them I did this and I was able to confirm before I got off the call that what they said they did they actually did.I assume that if the above is my experience, it must affect a lot of other people too. I don‚Äôt have a lot of confidence in making a complaint with American airlines, but I hope that maybe they might read this what I have posted online and try to do a better job taking care of customers."
310,"Refused to allow my son on plane because they thought he took boarding pass brusquely, even though we barely made it to gate after sprinting across Charlotte airport due to typical airline-related delay. They were impatient and urging us to hurry and simultaneously upset that he took boarding pass in rush that they construed as rude (hurt their feelings). What was also behind it was angry exchange with another customer just before we arrived on scene. They allowed that passenger to board after she calmed down, despite aggressive posturing and husbands filming whole thing. They forced him to erase tape before he could board. Poor assessment of who likely constitutes risk, and hubris. Rep said that one swear word is enough to get kicked off flight, and he can do whatever he wants. They are accountable to no one, and my son, a teen, doesn‚Äôt want to fly anytime soon. Also no apologies. I could tell the woman who was upset with my son felt the decision was an overreaction. Guilt was evident."
311,What has happened to this once good company LHR to ORD. premium economy.   Waste of money.  No drinks for an hour and surly angry staff ! Internal flights worse Avoid!
312,"Avoid American Airlines 1st Class:Los Angeles to LONDON, UK.  CHOICE OF MAGAZINES- NONE, CHOICE OF NEWSPAPERS- NONE  CHOICE OF WINE - (VERY POOR)-quality of food- mediocre but palatable. Quality of service- poor and disgruntled best to describe as passive agressive. Cost $15,810.00 In general for long distance travel best to choose another airline, or if it's a discount airline probably just as good as AA first class."
313,"I don't know where to begin... It seems Iberia and American Airlines have entered a competition to see who could be the absolute worst carrier.Their customer service is lousy, their planes are old and not the cleanest, they have a crew that is unincentivized to provide good service, and ticket prices aren't cheap.Best of luck turning this around, they used to be leaders, similar to the Iberia story."
314,covid cancelled our flights to south africa. now they are saying i can only use the $1500 credit if I am traveling from SA. what a bunch of crap. terrible airline. out $1500.
315,"Enough is enough.  We are a family of four that flys every month.  We were recently cancelled at a connection and rescheduled for 2 days later, which resulted in lost deposits, extra charges, and 29 hours of driving.  Now we seem to have lost our credits of about $1,565.  I was told that I had to book my tickets for each of us, place them on hold, and then call back so that they could use the credit to pay for a portion of my reservations.  I did that and then was placed on hold for several hours.  I requested a call back which I received 6+ hours later (2am) - after the expiration time at midnight.  I called again and that agent said to put in an extension request and she would place my tickets on a 48 hour agent hold.  I didn‚Äôt get the credit or the hold.  The tickets cancelled and I just had to purchase them for an additional $300.  Thanks so much for the help!  From the most recent experiences we have had, it is my belief that American Airlines will do anything not to have to pay or refund its customers.  We will be ignored, placed on hold for hours, cancelled last minute, and rescheduled without consideration. The excuses of supply chain, weather, Covid, and staffing problems are all wearing very thin. They no longer care about your loyal customers. They were once our first choice for air travel, now they will be at the bottom of the list!"
316,"I've been flying with American Airlines for 20 years+ and have never had a problem. My flights have usually left on time (with the exception of an MIA-CHI flight on Apr 2021 when all airlines were experiencing delays), and the planes have never seemed like they were falling apart (Spirit, I'm looking at you)."
317,"WHO ON EARTH DO YOUR VILE STAFF @HeathrowAirport think they are? DOES IT SAY ANYWHERE ON EITHER WEBSITE¬† 'BROWN AUTISTIC INDIVIDUALS' AREN'T ALLOWED ON THE FLIGHT? HOW DARE YOU LOT MISTREAT ME LIKE THAT: MADE ME MISS MY 4 month pre booked FLIGHT.Firstly, one disgusting employee named param took my passport at check in to ""confirm with supervisor"" if I can board because I'm autistic, purposefully making me miss the closing time . Then,they further aggravated the situation by changing my  main cabin extra seat without reason to some random left over standard, middle economy  seat and refused any form of refund for the difference even though this is standard  policy.Furthermore, when I asked for a different member of staff to deal with it ,the poor excuse of a human named brenda was further aggravating the situation with "" we'll wait for your daddy , daddy will explain to you"" to humiliate¬† a 26 year old autistic individual. EXCUSE ME . They even lied and  created the impression that I was acting suspicious & airport security were responsible for my missed  flight to shift accountability and justify no refund. Disgusting scum.They made me miss a non refundable wwe event which cost me ¬£2,500 and get conniving fake nice people on the phone to lure customers in ;who are a world away from the vermin at the airport."
318,No one to answer the phones.Average wait time is like 4 hours - that's not acceptable.Staff onboard are friendly.
319,"I booked an $800 flight to Cancun in April 2021. I was paralyzed in a traumatic accident in May 20 21. Originally, American Airlines give me a flight credit that said I had to book by April 2022. I'm in a power wheelchair, able to walk, at the young age of 29. I reached out to American airlines, hoping for a refund or a partial refund. I'm now on disability, and $800 is a lot of money and could help me financially.I explained my full situation to American Airlines, impressing upon them that I am in no condition to fly anytime soon. Do you want to know what this $11 billion company did? Extended my flight credit until September of this year. That's only six months away. Not only am I physically in capable of flying anytime soon, but I also have no intention of booking any upcoming trips.People with disabilities already have a difficult time getting accommodations when it comes to flying. I'm not asking for any extreme special treatment, only the basic consideration of my situation. For such a public and high-value customer to completely overlooked my plate, is detrimental to the disabled community as a whole. American Airlines, do better."
320,Just a PSA. Fly frequently and this is absolutely the worst airline and customer service you will encounter. Do not fly them if at all possible.
321,"These people must be the worst airline on the planet, the customer service team must be consistantly trained in poor customer service as each and everyone of them that i have spoken to have been unable to assist with what should be a very simple request.  They deliberately make things difficult, i can only assume that its with the intention of hoping you will give up.  I certainly would be very reluctant to use this airline again and would make sure it was my least preferred.  Come on guys, you must be able to do an awful lot better than this!"
322,"I'm going somewhere for two days for an important visit. They cancelled my 5:00 AM flight at midnight and tried to put me on a flight the following day which did not work with my schedule at all. I tried to look for other options and their customer service is so broken I can't make it work and I had to just end up cancelling. They won't give you a refund they give you ""flight points"" as if I'd ever want to fly with them again. Nonrefundable hotel booking is how I lost $300. Incredibly unreliable."
323,"On March 22nd we had a booked trip from RDU airport to Dallas, and was cancelled.  Following day, the new flight was completely full.  Beware, the airlines are cancelling flights to keep their airplanes full and you have to incur extra hotel payments due to that."
324,"Flight 5408 Boise to Phoenix 3/26/2022: Gabby Susan and Edgar were so helpful when taking my new 5-month-old dog ""Archie"" on his first flight. They not only made sure that he could fit under the seat, they walked us on the flight and helped us secure him for the flight. Thank you 3 for making our day and ""Archie"" is now a fan of American Airlines!"
325,"I‚Äôm from the UK and booked tickets for our holiday for 2020 from lax to Miami. Obviously because of covid we had to cancel. They wouldn‚Äôt give us a refund, only credit. I‚Äôve had to ring up so many times to ask about the credit or refund. I tried to use our credit and was told I could only use the credit on a domestic USA flight and not an international flight which is difficult/ impossible for us to do. They change the rules to suit themselves. If American Airlines expects me to do use then again then they need to issue a refund"
326,"I had booked flights for Spring Break 5 months in advance. We were leaving in 2 days so I went into see when the flights had to be confirmed. I went on the app to discover they had changed our flights both ways! I received no communication from American airlines. I called the customer service line to receive the run around that they could do nothing for us. The flight home was moved from 12:30 pm to 7:23 am! They moved it 5 hours up? How is this okay? We need to get up at 4 am- NOT OKAY! No compensation, nothing but having to get 5 people out of the house and packed at the crack of dawn! Thank you American- we will not be using you in the future. Best of luck!"
327,"My family and I were traveling to Hartford Ct to bury. I am disabled and need a wheelchair as well as utilizing a Service Dog. We travel rarely and when we do I take my service dog with me. From ILM we were treated fine, when we landed at DCA (Reagan Airport). When we went to board to Hartford the ticket agent started in with our Service Dog. The dog in question was certified 3 years ago, by American Airlines. She is up on all her shots, and they wanted to crate her. She is a SERVICE DOG that I am need just in case I get seizures, or low blood sugars, she cannot do her job if she is crated. We were traveling to bury my wife's brother. When she told him that all the supervisor could say is ""don't yell at me"". When they finally let us through, they sat me in the last seat. I am disabled and they put us in the back. I have a hard walking and they board me last.My troubles with this airline continued upon our return from the funeral. The same issue. As we waited in line the ticket agent screamed that she could not do dogs. I explained about my service dog to which she replied I still had to find an airline agent. When I asked where I could find the agent she pointed to the right, at the end. This was an all-out attack on my 12-pound fur baby who helps me and has no teeth. I called the airline the night before my flight, and they said there is no problem. With all that happened we feel that we should be compensated by either three passages on future flights with an upgrade. By the time we got home, both my wife and I had shot nerves."
328,I was flying from Miami back to Boston on business. I was waiting in line to have my bag checked. When my turn came a man cut in front of me. I explained that I had been waiting in line. The American employee or Sky Cap told me that he could not help me and proceeded to let a man who had not been waiting in line cut me because it was a friend of his and they began speaking in another language. I've never been treated so rudely in my life. I will not be using American Airlines anymore. Horrible customer service and the employees are in need of training.
329,ill try and make this short and sweetMy family and i were scheduled for our flight on a Tuesday going back home to TN. During the day on Monday my 6 year old son said his ear started hurting. So we took him to the doctor and had a serious ear infection. So obviously we couldnt fly back on Tuesday with an ear infection for my son. I called America Airlines to reschedule the flight for Wednesday and had to pay an extra 1200 dollars to change from Tuesday to Wednesday flight. Customer service ignored the circumstances that my family was under and completely ignored the fact that we couldnt fly on Tuesday under those conditions. After getting back home i called and emailed customer service if there was anything they can do about a refund (partial or full) to accomadate the circumstance we were in being unable to fly. After several emails back and forth they were unable to do anything. After all the no's i was given i ask maybe they would be willing to give us points for a future flight to accomadate and still receive a no. All i kept hearing was thats our policy sir and we cant do anything for you. I am a unhappy customer and would not recommend their customer service in any way shape or form.
330,"I have been flying with multiple airlines, but now with American it‚Äôs been the worse customer service possible. Trying to change dates, which cannot be done online.  Spent each time over an hour on the phone, international, and even when i reach a representative they keep putting me on hold, without warning, each time for 10-15 minutes, and no way they resolve anything.  Is it because they are underpaid, overworked, or simply incompetent? Or is it American system that needs improvement? Anyway, will try to remember this on my next travels."
331,"This was my first flying with my 4 month old. Although it was a short flight, I was quite nervous at the prospect of traveling and keeping bubs happy. Thankfully everything went well. From check in to baggage claim the AA crew did a really good job. I will be traveling again with you soon."
332,"AA forced us to buy brand new tickets to come home even though we had purchased roundtrip tickets and had the confirmation to prove it. They blamed Priceline and would've easily left us stranded in a foreign country. With no other option, we had to buy new tickets on the spot. When we got to our connecting flight we found another agent to help us. Turns out, AA inadvertently changed our roundtrip tickets to one way tickets when they updated out itinerary and should never have forced us to buy another ticket. I've never been treated so horribly by an airline. We expect a refund, explanation and an apology."
333,"Horrible Experience! It all started when we got delayed in MSP to get on our connecting flight in Dallas to Mexico. We asked the person at the gate when our plane kept getting delayed about what to do because we had a connecting flight in Dallas to Mexico. We were wondering if we should find another flight or get on the flight once it was ready to leave. She told us to wait and if we missed the flight in Dallas we would be put on the 1st flight to Mexico. THAT WAS A TOTAL LIE. When we finally got into Dallas we missed our connecting flight to Mexico. We went to the lady at the gate and asked her about our options and she told us we need to go to D24 to see what they can do. We got to D24 the lady at the customer service desk was rude and told us there was nothing even on other airlines. she gave us a hotel and food voucher and put us on standby for the next day. she never explained the Vouchers. We got to the hotel Fairfield and that was another nightmare, We end up finally getting the correct rooms after dealing with a rude front desk person and went to bed. we got up at 6am to go to the airport to get on a flight at 10 am but we were standby because thats what they put us as mind you we are a family of 5. Well that did not work because standby had only 4 seats and the rude lady at the gate asked my husband to go to Mexico with my children and leave me in Dallas until the next flight that night. We would not travel with out all of us to Mexico. We then got on the flight at night after we talked to another lady at D24 who actually gave us tickets for the next day if we did not get on the plane at 630.  We get into Mexico and then our checked bag is missing. We wait for 1 hr at the customer service desk to report our missing luggage. Its now been over 2 days at the airport and 11pm before we finally get out of the airport. We then try to talk to American Airlines through phone calls and messaging on the app and no one will help us. Our bag finally gets to us 7 days into our vacation. We get our bag and its a mess. Its missing the wheels, holes in it and cracked. We are also missing items. We refused the bag so the person who delivered the bag too it back to the airport. I tried to contact them only to get no help.When we left Mexico we tried to talk to them and they told us to talk to Dallas where the bag was missing from. While waiting in line to get on the plane to leave to Dallas a lady asked me to check my carry on and I told no way your company lost my luggage and I need my items so no way I would I check in my bag. I may have been rude but after 10 days of this mess I was over it. When we finally got back to MSP from our horrible trip we got information on our luggage at the ""repair place"" which it a hard side so it wont be fixed and a email address for our missing items. Still dealing with this headache. Worst trip ever and my son senior trip ruined because all we did every day is try and get American Airlines to talk to us and help us. The luggage had items we needed so we had to buy shoes and other clothes until we got our items."
334,"I wish I could leave a zero-star review. It was my first time buying from this company. Anyone I can, I will tell them to never buy from this garbage company, that don't care at all about their clients. They just want your money and F... you after you paid. I bought 2 people round trip and when I reached out to change the flight date, they said I was a basic plan and said, ""Use it or lose it"". Funny enough, my father in law bought the ticket they said it was main cabin, but we couldn't change the flight either, for some other made up excuse. PLEASE DONT BUY FROM THEM."
335,"I recently traveled to Cozumel, Mexico, on American Airlines. The return trip was the absolute worst flight I have ever been on. They have a program they call advantage member, its more like the DISADVANTAGED MEMBER. Got the Citi Master Card, supposed to have priority boarding, NOPE. Booked 4 months in advance, chose our seats based on our medical conditions. Supposed to recline, and have standard leg room. Arrived early we were actually 3rd couple in line to check in. App still said we had our seats. NOPE AA downgraded our seats with no explanation at all. Seats we got, NO recline, LESS leg room, UNFAVORED location, and we get to hear toilets flush entire trip. Couldn‚Äôt stow computer bag under the seat in front, because my knees were against the seat. Had to turn to the side a little just to pour the soda they give you. I will never fly this crap airlines again. I challenge AA management to fly in these seats. Row 33 needs to be removed from these planes. They charge $$$ for upgrades, $80 for more leg room, they should pay for less leg room, anywhere from $30 up for favored location, they should pay for unfavored location. I paid for a reclining seat, I didn't get it. I figure they owe everyone they bumped to that crappy row of seats a minimum $100."
336,"Talk about the absolute worst experience ever!  After getting married and having our honeymoon in Cancun‚Ä¶the nightmare began.  We sat on the tarmac in Cancun for 52 minutes.  Finally taking off then we get to Dallas.  Since our flight was late, and we had a layover of 1 hour and 25 minutes before the delay.  Immigration was a joke too.  So needless to say we knew we were going to miss our flight.  Called American Airlines to see if we could get another flight.  Lady on the phone said they could get us out but wouldn‚Äôt be until 830 the following morning.  Also they would cover room and food for the delay.  Finally get thru immigration, and now off to the customer service desk, along with about 70 other folks who were going to be missing connecting flights.  After standing in line for near 2 hours there, we finally make it to the counter.  The lady was very helpful, but trying to find a flight was a joke!  She tried sending us to any airport possible.  Said if we wanted to make it back to Portland we would have to wait 48 hours in Dallas on our own dime.  Not even a voucher for food!  Their best option was to send us to Philly the next morning, have a layover there for 7 hours then fly us to Seattle‚Ä¶.and from there find our own way home?  I don‚Äôt think so!  I paid for a round trip flight to Portland Oregon!  We sat in the airport all night long, and they had taken our bags from to us for the flight to Philly.  While we were waiting at the airport, we decided to look for flights on other airlines.  Figured we wouldn‚Äôt find anything since the ticket agent at AA said they couldn‚Äôt find any other flights on any other airlines.  After looking for 3 minutes we found a flight from Dallas, to LAX, then to Portland oregon the next day.  So we decided we wanted to book that flight, but tried to be proactive and get our bags back so they would be with us.  After phone calls and more phone calls, we couldn‚Äôt get any answers.  Decided to book it and say the hell with AA since they had been no help since the first moment.  We went to the ticket counter for AA at 330am to see about getting our bags.  Lady was very rude about it, and said she put it in the computer to get our bags back, but didn‚Äôt know how long it would take and we just needed to go wait.  Wouldn‚Äôt even cancel our flight we weren‚Äôt going to take, or even make a simple phone call to baggage to get our bags!  After waiting 40 minutes for our bags we had to catch our delta flight so we had to leave.  Come to find out, our bags were sent to 3 different locations‚Ä¶.Dallas, Philly, and North Carolina‚Ä¶.what a joke!  Once we FINALLY made it back to our destination in Portland, 37 hours later mind you, we had to put in for missing baggage.  After this experience, American Airlines will NEVER get my service again, and we have let all our friends and family know about how horrible this customer service is."
337,"horrible airline would not recommend them to anyone.I had a 1pm flight to St Louis we had to be there for 6pm to attend an event we had already paid for. 10 minutes before we are suppose to board our plane it get's delayed until 4:30 pm. We get to the customer service desk and they tells us we have no crew to fly the plane, I tell them i have to be in St Louis before 6pm and they put us on a 2pm flight we just have to get across the terminal to the new gate by the time we get to our new gate to check in that flight has now been delayed to after 3pm and we are moving to a new gate again to wait for the plane to get her hopefully. Lucky for us as we are walking we find anoth airline with a 2 pm flight to St louis and we get on it and get there in time. Thank you SOUTHWEST, at leaste you have crews to fly your booked flights. after I get home and call American to get my refund as the service desk told I could they refused to refund my money and would only give me a cedit for the vaule of the cost of the tickets not even some type of upgrde to show that they care that they almost cost me a lot more money they just the tickets for the flight. I guess it's our fault that they had no crew to fly there plane, they can keep there tickets and BS credit I would rather loss it then fly on them again. Trust me look at there reviews stay away it was my first and last time ever deling with American Airlines"
338,"Flying aa for years, however my last experience was far from good. At the counter, the lady insist on scanning the wrong passport (dual citizenship): 'it doesnt matter' she insisted, i ask for a manager that took 30 mins to show up...Then, at the gate, they call my group, 1, and she said that they must check again all our documents, again in a different gate (counter), back when the last passenger boarding. My business class experience, four times a coach ticket, was not good.I will not tell about the flight attendant that woke me up asking to put back my mask.."
339,"Very horrible Airline to fly with they canceled their Flights to NYC claiming weather conditions, every other flights went to nyc that day without issues, they didn‚Äôt even offer hotel,nothing at all but getting us on a flight for the next day. Disgusting inconsiderate people."
340,"I m flying overseas in July, I booked the reservation through the internet, picking up the time that worked for me and my family, the 12:38 flight from Boston to New York, American airlines cancel my arround trip .3 reservations, and they did not call me to check with me about any other alternative. I found out after I  was checking my reservation. The site agent is checking about it, she informed me that that they have 8:45 am flight, 10 hours layover in New York, and not confirmed yet. I have my itinerary with all the flights numbers and the actual time before they cancel. Still waiting."
341,Over abundance of cancelled or delayed flights. Finally got a flight that arrived early. Yeah. Except now have been waiting on checked bag for 45 minutes. On another flight had some sensitive circuit components so put in hard shell carry on size suitcase so could put in overhead bin so didn't get trashed by their luggage handlers. Was forced to gate check it but when plane departed the bins were less than 40% full. Ridiculous.
342,The flight got changed twice and i was no longer able to do the connexion with my previous leg.I called (from France) to be reimbursed.I faced:Unacceptable delay for answering my email (6 weeks).Unacceptable resolution (i had to call several times multiple numbers to get an answer from somebody else)Unacceptable rejection to be reimbursed for the 1 hour i spend on a toll/premium number with nobody to answer my call ($20 cost)I'll do my best to never fly American again.They deserve to get bankrupted again.
343,"Slight Delay from St. Thomas to Dallas.  No big deal, we had 45 minutes to get to our gate for our Omaha destination which was 5 gates away.  Plane landed then stopped moving.  Then went over to Tarmac purgatory.  Captain said they had a ""kerfuffle"".  AA software malfunctioned and applied Daylight savings time a couple hours too early which meant DFW thought we were arriving an hour later and had no gate to unload.  Finally unloaded and ran to gate arriving a minute early and witnessed our plane still at the gate.  Sorry they said, gate closed.  This was the last flight for the night.  AA App solution, the only option we had to communicate our issue since phone care was a 2 hour wait and customer care line was 50 deep with only 2 employees, was to fly out 3 days later with a stop in Charlotte.  6 hour flight to go 1.5 hours north. 3 days later.  Thankfully we were able to book nearby hotel, find a flight to KC next day out of Love field with SW Air and have our son do a 6 hour round trip car drive to pick us up the next day.  Congrats AA, our luggage was at the airport in Omaha.  These were paid-for, class A tickets.Only way to get a refund and a rejection of any other costs we incurred is to send an email with an expected response in 7-10 days.  Pretty sure from below posts, ""kerfuffle"" means ""weather"" in AA speak.Not holding our seats on last flight of the night knowing we are sitting at another gate waiting for the door to be opened reflects a serious disregard for customer care and more importantly, a complete lack of operational awareness and ability.We have been flying SWA for decades.  Yes, no seat assignment can at times be a hassle if you don't know the process.  If you know the process, it's slick and easy.  We have their credit card and haven't paid for a flight in years.  SWA would have held that flight.AA executives clearly not up to the task of running an airline.  Their shareholders should demand a change."
344,My family member has Platinum Pro status and still it took more than 7 hours to get a call from customer service. We had good experience before.  How did the service go down so bad?
345,"I was returning from vacation and they cancelled my flight. The people I spoke to on the phone and in person were rude and basically just took the attitude ""sucks to be you."" They booked me on another flight more than 2 DAYS later. I missed an incredibly important doctor appointment. I missed work. My car spent 2 extra days in long term parking.  I was compensated for nothing. No meals. No hotel stay. Just a big middle finger after hours of waiting in line. They said they don't compensate for flights cancelled for weather. It was sunny out. There is no way the flight was cancelled for weather conditions, they just said that so they did not have to compensate anyone. I have pictures of the ""terrible weather"" that shows the sun shining.Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced"
346,"I flew with my family from Arizona to NY. We left at Midnight with a two-hour layover in PA. Not having slept, on our second flight, I put my coat over my face and fell asleep almost as soon as I got on the plane. The flight attendant apparently wanted to check that I had my seat belt on prior to taking off. She approached me and in order to wake me, she shoved my arm. I woke up disoriented and in taking my coat off of my head, my mask had come down a little. She threatens to take down my name and proceeds to tell me that she will need to wake me to check that my mask is on after this. I understand the rules and always abide by them. I also want to note another passage who was sitting in the row in front of me had her mask down below her nose and the flight attendant was polite to her about adjusting her mask.  But she proceeds to wake me up two more times by shoving me after this in an hour and a half flight. It was aggressive enough that both my husband and another passenger remarked about her behavior. I am not sure why she felt the need to put her hands on me. I legitimately felt targeted. In addition, once I arrived home, I discovered items missing out of my CHECKED bags. I emailed American Airlines and received a basic cookie-cutter reply. I guess they think if your mask slips down that it is okay to be manhandled and targeted by their staff. Also okay to pay them to rob me."
347,"Always late, it's really bad when you want to get somewhere on time. I avoid them"
348,"THE WORST AIRLINE COMPANY EVER !!! So unprofessional and disappointing. Delaying flights, providing false departure time, not replying to emails...and making people wait forever to talk to someone who also helps nothing. Never had worse experience..."
349,Nightmare to fly. Overpriced with terrible routes. Legroom is like a medieval torture device.
350,I work in the Caribbean for 8 or so years so I travel there 3/4 times per year. I got Turned away from my flight today because I did not have a return ticket. (For my work we charter from island to island.) This is the first time this has ever happened and have travelled almost every time without a return ticket. I asked to buy a return in which I was told we don‚Äôt have time I should I arrived 3 in advance. (Bare in mind it was an 1hr 30min to get to check in)
351,"I initially booked a ticket to Chicago with this company which I then had to change to a different destination. I asked for a receipt to be issued showing the value of the ticket as I needed to claim this from my employer. It seems like a straightforward request right? Other companies I have flown with would take minutes to issue something like this. But not AA .. I have now spent over three hours on the phone, spoken to 4 different individuals in 2 different departments, submitted a written request to customer service online, but the receipt is still nowhere to be seen. This company's customer service is appalling. I do hope their pilots are not quite as incompetent."
352,"DO NOT FLY WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES! lost my bags,  was told they didn't even get put on the plane but would be returned within 24 hours, no bags in sights, the wheresmysuitcase.com people said the file hasn't even been registered with them to say my baggage is missing, the AA online baggage tracker doesn't work, they haven't responded to my multiple emails, they won't answer the phone. Been on hold for HOURS before being cut off and costing me hundreds in phone bills. Had to change my holiday plans and buy new clothes. This company have completely ****** me and holiday and won't even communicate 1 word with me to get me my bag back. If this goes on I'll have lost thousands of pounds. DO NOT USE AMERICAN AIRLINES. YOULL BE BETTER OFF SWIMMING THE ATLANTIC."
353,"Three Mondays ago, I had to go Los Angeles to bring my son that was depressed back home to Boston.  I was on flight 377 that left around 6 am.  During the flight,  I shared my concern and worry with the flight attendants and the compassion, care, and comfort that I received was immeasurable.   I asked for their names but have misplaced the paper with them on it.  I believe that their names were Ronette, Susanne, Jeanine, and Matt. Please thank them all very much for their customer service and compassion that they extended to me.  My name is Cynthia Collotta, and I was able to bring my son home for medical care.  Thank you for having such outstanding employees.  It makes a difference."
354,"Thought I was on my way to a much  needed getaway until I checked my reservations online. The site said I didn't have a reservation! Called and was given a record locator number and the site still says I didn't have a reservation. Then when I called for help I was on hold for an hour. All I wanted was a seat assignment and to be able to get my boarding pass. I'm 77 years old I don't need to lie awake for hours worrying if I even have a reservation. I made the reservation through an agent and thought for sure it was taken care of. This wasn't the first time I have had problems with this airline, but it will be my last. I will travel with a different airline from now on."
355,"Just everything is wrong with this airline. Sloppy, scruffy, bad food, rude employees. They lose you bags and take days to return them to you. Not worth it - you‚Äôre better off going by boat than using these donkeys"
356,"Ok. Let me tell you about my experience with American Airlines (frankly, I hardly want to call it an airline of America). First of all, UNLIKE Delta airlines (Which is the best US airline) they did NOT sanitize their airplanes. The airplane was also extremely dirty. I hated it. They also put people on the plane and did not block the middle seat like delta did (Again)... Then they said ""Plz social distance""... LIKE DUH, ARE THEY DUMB??? Like that's not what u say when you do NOT block the middle seat... I hated it. I absolutely HATED it. NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER fly the trashy airline American airlines. Now onto United..."
357,"Cancelled flight, no alternative offered, stranded in a hotel and phone line has a 4 hour wait."
358,"DICTATORSHIP THIS AIRLINE SUPPORTS AND SHARES PROFITS WITH THE CUBAN COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP, ALSO TAKES FUNCTIONS OF REPRESSORS IN NOT LETTING CUBANS RIDE BY ORDERS OF THE CUBAN DICTATORSHIP"
359,"What should have a been a relaxing birthday/valentines vacation to Cabo for my wife and I (her bday 2/12, mine 2/18) became a nightmare. Our flights was delayed 3 times (5am-11am) until an Aa agent finally was honest and told us the plane isn‚Äôt coming and not to hold our breath. The agent checked for a different fight and couldn‚Äôt find anything, but AA was transparent and told us sooner we would have had more options to fly out the same day. After finding a flight for the next day at another airline(delta) we then were advised to go to customer service to change our return flight. While changing our return flight the AA cs agent told us the departing flight we were given wasn‚Äôt properly done and we weren‚Äôt going to be able to get on that fight, so he canceled it to put us on yet another airline (united) which had a layover and charged for carry on. I asked to be compensated for the price of the carry on but he told me there was nothing he could do. To avoid paying for the luggage on this new new flight with united, I spoke to an agent at delta and they told me there was space and I can fly with them if AA release the funds to pay for the flight. This process took me 4hrs of walking back and forth speaking to multiple people for an issue that AA agent caused. Because I couldn‚Äôt get a same day flight I‚Äôm now stuck in a 2 star hotel and missing out on $1000 for a day at my Cabo resort plus the car rental. In my opinion AA owes me for this nightmare which could have been avoided with compassion, transparency, and decent customer service. Thanks AA for ruining my wife and I birthday. I hope I get a response with some form of compassion to help fix this, maybe I should listen to your own agent and not hold my breath."
360,Love American made platinum status this year and I love the benefits that are offered.
361,"Two years into Covid and American still take 3 hours to answer phone calls. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have had enough time to learn to manage their call volumes, but no, their attitude seems to be let‚Äôs ignore customers for as long as possible so we don‚Äôt have to deal with them."
362,"This past weekend was a first for me as our flight home to Minnesota was cancelled and we were notified less than 2 hours from departure.  It was an ice storm on Thursday, so an act of God is tough to make right with people, but American Airlines really didn't handle this one very well.  When we arrived at San Antonio airport on Saturday we had no idea of this until we were almost to luggage drop off.  We then were greeted by a very good employee, EJ, who did everything he could to help us get home.  He finally found us a flight the next morning to Washington DC, then a flight to Minneapolis a couple of hours later.  They put us up in a very nice hotel in Lewiston Texas and handed us some vouchers.  This is where things fell apart.  Much to our surprise we were handed $12 vouchers for dinner that night.  That's right $12 vouchers. We were going to be staying 24 extra hours past our trip and were handed $12 for our trouble.  It gets worse, we were also told that we would still have to pay for our luggage, $30 a person.  We also did not have shuttle capabilities so the next day we forked over $140 in uber fees between the 6 of us traveling as we had our golf bags and needed two vehicles.  Not only missing our daughter's basketball tournament, but then throwing on all these extra costs, was not well received by us the customer.  Also the extra $25 in parking that we paid in Minneapolis didn't feel real great.  Between meals and transportation approximately $70 per person extra and we got a $12 voucher. The rough experience along w/ the fact that no one from the company will respond to our calls about the ordeal will make it hard to not only use, but also to recommend American Airlines in the future."
363,"Worst airline ever, still in shock how they managed to be active after all the flights they cancel and lies. 10 hour delay in Philly in the plane for ‚Äúpilot does not want to fly anymore‚Äù , ‚Äúdoor is broken can‚Äôt get out‚Äù , ‚Äúnever mind door is working‚Äù etc ."
364,"Charlotte airport Feb 4thru 6. Flying home by myself with a bad hip injury and on crutches/wheelchair. Between Friday and Sunday night I had six canceled flights, 4 trips back-and-forth on the shuttle between the hotel and the airport, lost luggage that I still haven‚Äôt seen, 10 hour hold times and one very sour floor manager who lied and pushed everything back on me. I returned to the hotel Saturday from the cancelled flights with another hotel  voucher which they printed with the wrong date, and after hours on the phone american would not do anything for me unless I went back to the airport no matter what condition I was in. Thank goodness the hotel manager had a little kindness and figured something out for me so I wouldn‚Äôt have to get on the shuttle yet again. Even The awesome wheelchair guy who was trying to help me navigate the manager and luggage team and finding my luggage was shocked at the runaround I was getting at 7am as I arrived for my first cancelled flight and needed to find my luggage.  In Three days I couldn‚Äôt find anybody at american who could just figure out a way to get me home. Also, their technology was horrible. My sister never would‚Äôve left me if my flight had shown that it was canceled. The app would let you know until about an hour after a flight is canceled so you go to the gate or you go to the airport and then find out. No excuses for that. 10 years credit card customer. No more I‚Äôm ripping it up. The stats for the weekend say it all. AA had 1,000s of flights cancelled, united and delta barely a 100 combined.Oh and when I finally did get my flight home they didn‚Äôt turn on the electric outlets on a 6hour flight that didn‚Äôt have built in entertainment units (flight attendant mentioned her outlets working so wasn‚Äôt sure why pilot didn‚Äôt turn then on for everyone). A lot of people ran out of juice on this very tight and cramped plane. No wonder people are starting to get angry and beat each other up on these flights. I get it now."
365,3 flights canceled in the same trip!!!!! 18 hours for customers service to call back!!!! Please please please no matter if the flight is cheaper please pick another airline!!!
366,"My husband and I have had the AA credit card for around 30 years.  My points go to miles. We have thousands of points accumulated. We used to fly multiple times a year. We will continue to boycott American and all airlines until they stop these criminal mandates. I've been a Registered nurse for 41 years. They are forcing medical tyranny.    I have major security concerns because of the staff that they coerced/forced to jab. Vax injuries are through the roof. I've seen the proof from my  family, friends, patients, multiple physicians that I know, all treating vax injuries daily, VAERS, and now straight from the DOD medical site for all the thousands of vax injuries from our military. Bloodclots in flight, can be deadly not just for the pilot. And...  I refuse to wear a dirty diaper on my face for hours. Masks DO NOT WORK. They cause more harm than they help. Stop the insanity!"
367,Second worst company in the US after of course Comcast! They just don‚Äôt care!
368,"This is my third time in less than a year flying with American Airlines. All three times, AA has canceled my flight. Last time, I wasn‚Äôt notified that the flight was canceled. I found out when my wife checked the flight status the night before we flew home. She was worried they might cancel since my last flight was canceled and I had to sleep at the airport. It was a nightmare. And the next time wasn‚Äôt much better. This time, they canceled our flight home when we were on our way to the airport. We were unable to get through to anyone on the phone or online. When we got to the airport, we learned that they canceled multiple flights. The line went on forever. The staff told us to get out of a line because it was for international flights and get in line for the kiosk. Our canceled flight didn‚Äôt register in the kiosk and we were directed to get back into the line I was just in (that was significantly longer and still not moving). None of the employees knew what they were talking about and they were just as miserable and unhelpful as the other stranded passengers. No one could help us get a refund. They say you have to do it online. They‚Äôre website is shut down due to user volume. I doubt they give us a refund, anyway. They sent my wife an email asking her to reschedule a flight home two days from now. Are you kidding me?!?!It should be noted that on every trip, every other airline was functioning. AA is garbage. I should‚Äôve learned by now not to fly AA. My advice, don‚Äôt ever book with AA. If you use a 3rd party, make sure none of your flights are AA. It‚Äôs worth spending more money for a smooth trip."
369,"We must be honest that our experience with American was as positive as possible. Of course the muzzles are stupid, but as that is a federal power trip, it can't be restricted to only one airline. There were a couple powerhungry bad attitudes, which is why it's 4 stars instead of 5. However, when we missed our connecting flight through no fault of our own, American paid for us to stay in a pleasant hotel, with food vouchers, and very quickly took care of rebooking the flight. Additionally, above and beyond, I accidentally checked our luggage again (forgetting it too had rolled over in the rebooking). I contacted customer service for a refund, honestly not expecting much. To my pleasant surprise, a kind lady named Sandy informed me that the fee would be refunded, and that we would be given $400 trip credits for our trouble. The refund has processed. And so, for all that airlines/airports can be horrible, I was thankful for the positives in this trip. They did a great job this time."
370,"Booked 1st class for our honeymoon,  lay flat seats are nice but not a first class experience, way out was ""ok"", way back started off good.  But on plane the attendants didn't really care (and even complained to me we were boarded before they were ready), food was serviced quickly (regardless of you being ready or not),  I'd say 3/5 and NOT 1st class.The reason this is 1/5 is the customer service via app or phone or email.  its beyond awful, they can't answer simple questions like ""Can I drop off my luggage early"" (after taking 30 minutes to ""research"").  They don't understand simple requests just response with scripted replies that make no sense.  I'd say pick any other airline, as you certainly won't be treated ""1st class"" and barely treated as human.."
371,"I WAS NOT ABLE TO FLY WITH MY DOG SPOCK I was traveling back with me small dog from Dominican Republic after 6 months of staying there. I was told to get the papers CDC requires for him and my covid test one day before the trip. My flight was on January 21, 2022. After I bought a ticket and attached my dog to my reservation the representative told me that someone from special services would be in touch to verify everything.  One week later they did. I told them all papers I had and we were USA citizens including my dog Spock returning home. 2 days before the fight I received emails with some forms to fill out on line regarding covid 19 and a form  that I did have my negative test. The day we went to the airport, which is 2.5 hours from where I live (Montecristi) , while on line to check in, a gentlemen came to tell me that my dog couldn't fly, that AA had ban dogs and cats. I told him we had the CDC requirements and all the papers in order. He said he knew it but it was AA that had the ban and I couldn't fly. I even had the printout from the CDC that says on December 2021 that dogs returning to USA with proof of microchip, rabbies certificate from USA and 6 months old or more could RE-ENTER.  THE SUPERVISOR SAID IT WAS AA that had the ban not the CDC.  United and Delta didn't have the ban, but they don't fly direct to Miami, it would have been at least 15 hours going to NY or Newark and taking another flight to Florida. The worse part is the there is no one in charge that can do anything. When you call customer services, the are  useless for this things, what it says on their  screen goes, like robots  AA has my personal information since 1995, email Telefone, address, contacts for emergency, WHY THEY DIDN'T CALL ME THAT DAY IN THE AM, and told me that I could not fly? What kind of service is these?  What kind of airline it's AA turning into? First they tell me it's ok then it's not!   I sent and email complaining the same day I couldn't fly, today they told me it takes 10 to 15 days to reply. I try to get my refund on line, but it says I have a credit for future travel  no option to get my money into my CC. This is unacceptable. I'm being force to fly with them, which I CAN'T BEAUSE MY DOG Spock can't go with me.  Am I suppose to stay here until they decide otherwise??  This is an abuse, inconsideration, bad communication between departments, and customer services/relations is the worse I have seen.  We the customers should be first, but I guess they have lost the special touch they had years back, too bad. I am waiting for them to call email either me next week (they don't call) and see what they will say about my refund.  Shame AA, YOU ARE NOT WHAT YOU USED TO BE. In the future I will think twice on flying with you anywhere else without my dog. You are a disappointment 100% and for what I read I'm not the first one to have problems lately.Maria E Alvarez"
372,"To whom it may concern:     As an American Airline customer for many years the situation that took place at the Dallas airport on December 28, 2021 Flight number FDJCRB was hurtful and embarrassing. My daughter and I were taking a much needed vacation after experiencing several deaths of friends and family members. Our flight from Phoenix was delayed by an hour which caused us to get to the connecting flight in Dallas late. We ran through the airport trying to make the flight just to arrive and experience an employee by the name of Sasha disrespect and demean us. My daughter had previously dropped her passport into a pool but had used the passport several months prior to this trip without any issues. We were advised by Sasha that ‚Äúwe were going no where with this passport!‚Äù  As Sasha yelled, she walked back and forth demanding that I get on the flight without my daughter. My passport was new so there was no issue with my passport. My daughter and myself were trying to ask Sasha questions to understand what the problem was but we could not speak with her because she yelled and made such a scene. Sasha demanded the flight was about to leave and she could rush me on but I would need to leave now and not speak with my daughter! My daughter pleaded with the employee who then turned to the system and stated that my daughter would never use this passport and that she would make sure of it. I asked to speak with her manager but Sasha‚Äôs response to me was that her manager was on the phone and did not need to be involved in this conversation. To my disbelief I was shocked to be treated in such a manner! I asked Sasha for my passport she responded that I would get it back when she was done with it. My daughter walked away very upset I was nearly in tears! I waited for Sasha to complete what she was doing I asked now that the flight is gone why does she still need my passport she laughed and stated that she was doing her job and that I did not know what she was doing so she would give it back once she was done. I spoke to the gentleman who originally assisted me and asked him what parent would leave their child in an airport? He hung his head in embarrassment for how we were being treated. Once I received my passport back in my possession from Sasha, I walked away and went to the service desk. I waited to book another flight while waiting in the long line of people that had their flights canceled a manager walked over to the line asking people what they were in need of. I began to explain to her the disrespect that we had just experienced at the area for us to board the Cancun flight. The manager advised that they were not allowed to take the passport if the picture in it was damaged. My daughter showed her the passport that the picture was not damaged as well as the stamp from a previous month in which she had just gone to Cancun and the passport had been accepted. The manager apologized for the behavior of the employee and advised that I inform American Airlines of the treatment that we received. My flight was rebooked and my daughter was booked on a different airline in which we had to pay another airfare due to the season the flights were very expensive.  I had originally paid $400 dollars alone just for seats on the planes which we were caused by Sasha to be missed but not credited. The flight that I was rebooked on gave me a middle seat in which I suffered motion sickness the rest of my trip to get to Cancun. I paid the expensive price for the seats to avoid the illness. Myself as well as my children, friends and family members have used this airline for many years and I am disappointed by the inhumane treatment that we received. I would like to be compensated for the disrespect that we had to endure. We just used American airlines to fly to my sister‚Äôs funeral a few months prior, if there was a problem with the passport Sasha could have just advised that we talk it over among ourselves and figure out what we wanted to do. She could have advised us what the rules were and gave us information of what was available. I did not post any videos on social media or contact my attorney as of yet due to the airline personnel advised that I contact American Airlines to give them a chance to rectify this issue. He was very professional and kind as well as empathetic toward our situation and time of grieving. We appreciate your timely assistance with this matter.  Sincerely, Luticia Taylor"

374,"First of all my wife purchased tickets and return was wrong day‚Ä¶..AA would not refund or change the flight!‚Ä¶kept saying economy. Even though she purchased insurance which those people never answered the phone!‚Ä¶.I booked a different return flight and had to cancel or get credit on this flight due to Covid travel issue. When I tried to get credit they said sorry it‚Äôs an economy ticket no refunds etc‚Ä¶..so my advice is to never buy insurance, never use AA, or make sure you buy a ‚Äú certain ‚Äú ticket that is refundable etc. also good luck getting a hold of anyone at any of these travel companies. I will never fly on AA again if I can help it?"
375,I waited to be called back for 2 hours only to be told at midnight that I‚Äôd have to wait for the points division. I waited and was placed on hold again. When the man came back he accidentally disconnected me. I needed to speak with American Airlines within 24 hrs so I started over. I was to receive a call back within 1 hr and 40 min. After 2 hrs I called and they let me know they‚Äôd be calling in 17 min. So I waited. When the man called me he said hello. I said I need to speak with the points division. He said hello and hung up on me. So now I am waiting 2 more hours to see if a third American Airlines employee hangs up on me‚Ä¶..
376,"My first class experience was horrible.  I scheduled & paid for a round trip flight to Hawaii on October 4.  The aircraft seating was for cubbies with an early afternoon return time.  Within a week of scheduling our flight the return flight times chanced to a late day return.  But wait I paid an extra $900.00 for early return time.  AA refused to refund the $900.00.  When we boarded our return flight in Honolulu we realized our first class cubby  seating wasn't available. The aircraft had been changed to a A32N.  Class of seating was bulk head at best.  We had not eaten, because we always get a lite dinner in first class. We weren't prepared to have our personal tablets and ear-bud for entertainment, that's right no entertainment available for any class of seating. We were offered a drink, but one only drink was delivered.  The hospitality was hostel.  Time to move back to United Airlines.  P.s. I have pictures of the first class seating and the trash that wasn't picked up until just before  landing.  We fly to Hawaii at least once a year.  Over the last 30 years,  we have  experienced little hiccups, but I can not believe how bad this flight was.  Time to move to United  Airlines."
377,"Customer service is non-existant. They lost my bags. I called the only number available. An automated system states they will call you back in 3-23 hours. Sometimes they don't call at. If they do call you back, they will only sell tickets at their only number. They then transfer your call to someone else. You'll be on hold for an hour or two before the call disconnects. This has happened for six days, sometimes more than once per day. They really don't care at all about their customers."
378,"My return flight originally booked direct from Cincinnati to Chicago arrival at approximately 11 am Central. Due to ground member complications, our flight was deplaned and the 65 of us were told to rebook. I was advised if my flight was direct with destination Chicago to standby. The flight was then given a status of delayed, to board approx 3 pm, then delayed again to 545pm. The agent gave no guarantee that the flight would be taking off as they were waiting for a part and she suggested I fly through Charlotte to Chicago. As I have a flight leaving Chicago today, Dec 8 to Spain, my place of residence, I agreed to the change flights. As you can imagine, I am completely unsatisfied with this turn of events and complete waste of my time. I have previously been taking buses from Cincy to Chicago, which take approx 6 hours. I opted for an early flight at more than 4x the price to save my time and energy for my international flight. As a ""sorry"" your team offered me 12 USD in exchange for the 9+ hours of unexpected airport/flight time. This amount didn't even cover a decent lunch in the local storefront - I purchased a bottled water, turkey sandwich and fruit cup for 17 USD. I cannot really begin to explain how disappointed I am that my last day in the US was spent at an airport and running around catching transit flights instead of having quality time with my family. In the end, I did not save my time, money, energy, nothing with this mistake from your team. Everyone makes mistakes, but I don't see why your team's mistake should be at my expense. I spent 12+ hours in transit instead of the simple 30 minute flight I bargained for; I could have driven faster, but I opted for the convenience American Airlines promotes. I might, like many others on our flight stated, make another choice when picking future flights. I appreciate your attention to this matter.Your refunds team stated as I took the flight there can be no refund, that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Terrible delivery and won't take accountability for the poor service. Will not book with American in the future."
379,Flew to NYC and back with American Airlines and had no issues or problems. Staff were generally very nice.
380,"On December 19th, I flew with American Airlines partnered with Finnair from Stockholm Arlanda to Los Angeles. The flight should have departed at 2:15 PM but was delayed. Then I was supposed to fly to Honolulu from Los Angeles. However, due to the delay, my connecting flight to Honolulu was rebooked to the next day without any warning at all. I just got an email that said it was rebooked after I already landed.I received no information and no help from either American Airlines or Finnair's employees on the flight between Stockholm Arlanda and Los Angeles.  I had to go to the service counter at American Airlines and they told me that it was Finnair's responsibility to pay for the accommodation. I then tried to find employees from Finnair in Los Angeles but there is no physical desk for Finnair's customer service center at LAX. As the flight was rebooked until the next day (from December 19th to December 20th), I had to book and pay for a hotel night near Los Angeles airport and pay for dinner. I tried to call Finnair's customer service center and it was closed which is completely unacceptable considering that they have no service desk at LAX. In addition, I had to go to the American Airlines counter several times at which point they literally told me that it ""was not their problem."" They refused to help me find accommodations for the night or even give me any options of nearby hotels where I could stay. I would definitely not advise anyone traveling internationally to fly with American Airlines, because what if you get stuck in an airport somewhere? They wouldn't even help me in United States where they have an entire terminal of the airport."
381,"I recently purchased a vacation package 2 Costa Rica through Riu vacations. I have to cancel due to covid concerns. American Airlines refused to give me a travel voucher or a refund after I canceled my vacation due to covid and have lost $1,200. American Airlines is a multi-billion-dollar company and I really find it hard to believe that they can't find a way to compensate me for my loss. The only answer that they could provide for me was because Ryu booked a non-refundable ticket they could not give me travel credit nor a refund even during covid times. This is very inconsiderate and it creates a hardship for me because I don't have $1,200 just to give away without some benefit for the money that I've spent. I would appreciate American Airlines finding some way to compensate me this is a terrible inconvenience. With many families having to deal with the stress of covid-19 and now the Omicron virus I would think that American Airlines should be able to make an exception. I certainly would appreciate receiving a better response from the airline. I should also mention that Riu because they booked the flight along with the hotel stay they were more than willing to refund my hotel stay. I just wished Airlines would step up and do the same. I welcome a response from an airline manager or someone in a position to be able to compensate me for my loss."
382,"After a day and half trying to get a hold of American Airlines because of a long list of cancelations and complicated lay- over issues and finally getting a return call a half hour before the intended flight out from Pensacola Fl to Manchester NH- I finally received a call from the THE most arrogant condescending AA customer service rep. said to me "" Talking to you people in the northeast is like beating a dead horse..you just go on and on""!!!! I wasn't the only one who heard this as the call was on speakerphone.   I was trying to explain that I've received over 30 conflicting texts about the flight/layovers I was about to take . I finally called back to AA got a really nice lady who booked me a flight out of another airport to MHT. I will never do this again- extremely poor customer services, extremely poor mismanaged flights, and even worse communications.  You can't even make it right by saying YOU""RE SORRY-YOU SCREWED UP- you cost me not only a day and half of stress, and took time away from my vacation but you cost me dearly for reservations...completely unacceptable! This is not my opinion these are actual facts . My opinion goes way beyond this.."
383,"I flew both ways to Charlotte South Carolina and back to Spokane Wa. I am a double above knee amputee and I am a big man. The reason I tell you this I hope it explains why I would have a problem using an aircraft restroom I was in a bad way going to South Carolina but that was my fault but going to Spokane I tried not to have the same problem a going south. I had to fly from Charlotte to Pheonix and when I got off the plane I had to go to the restroom really bad but the people at the airport that were suppose to help me ended up making me suffer very much they told me I didn't have time to go and put me in line to board, me being in a wheelchair I really didn't have much choise, and I am not a pushy person. So I usually get loaded 1st but they had me load last now remember I had to go bad already but 3 hrs later I was about to blow up. The flight crew on 1441 Pheonix to Spokane was the best they felt bad for me and wish they could help me but there was nothing they could do but they did end up helping me the most. The head attendant asked the Captain to let the office know I needed to debark first and they brought the isle chair down and had a wheelchair there to get me off and to a restroom as quickly as possible and to relief for the first time in 8 hours +. Thank you very much Rebecca you were my savior next to my wife. I don't know if I will ever fly American Air again but never say never. Right?"
384,I‚Äôve flown with AA three times now. Booked with BA and flown AA. Every time I‚Äôve flown the air cabin crew have been miserable and Moaned. Will try and avoid BA & AA for future flights to the states. Sad really because their prices are affordable
385,"No comparation, American go out of their way to simply be the worst of all times... I wish they would go away permanently, that way i would be force to find other routes"
386,"The time of Our flight leaving Mexico in 3 months was changed from a decent 2 pm to an intolerable 6am.  When we declined this flight, they gave us a refund.  Good customer service; however Zero dependability!"
387,"Because the cabin baggage was a little bigger, they charged me $150 for itHorrible"
388,"Waited 4 hours for a call back  supposed to be only 45 minutes.   After that incoming call their idiotic system ask me reason to push 1 and 2  on the phone to confirm its me for some reason the system did not recognize and just hang up on me !   This is not anymore American Service its becoming really bad to deal with those companies !   I have to revise the review, even the system was bit designed nonsense but we know IT people are not the best for creating end user friendly  system.  At least the system called me again and got a really good live person on the line.  She checked the covid rule changes and was able to at least issue a Airline Credit,  I wish during this covid time if regulations change customer should receive a money refund,  its hard to predict and book those flights with all the changes every day :("
389,"I once traveled in the usa and used american airlinesThey have sub prime employeesSub Prime, like sub prime mortgages, which destroyed the unites states economy in 2008, remember that year?They tried to overcharge us, for the weight of the baggage and I can guarantee you that the bags were not overweight, as we have a digital scale and we check the weight before checkingI refused to pay the surcharge and the american airline responded by insulting the entire Russian population, saying that we are all cheap charliesI can assure the Orangutan employee of american airline, that even in Russia there are many middle-class citizens with quite good salariesPaying a $ 50/100 premium isn't a problem hereI don't want to pay if the american airlines Orangutan employee wants to over charge customers for no reason"
390,"The worst experience in my life! You have to wait hours to contact customer service. Stay away from these scammers!!! I canceled my flight and received credit for future travels. Once I wanted to use this credit I was told it has to be from Canada. It is ridiculous, I wasn't notified about this policy before. OF course, they won't return my money. Stay away from these scammers!!!"
391,"I have flown every airline recently. AA is absolutely the worst: they are incredibly stringent on the masking requirements, forcing even passengers with HEARING AIDS to wear an ear-bound mask instead of a neck gator. I cancelled a flight that was 'non-refundable' (admittedly, my fault) but when I called to inquire about possible credits or transfers, absolutely zero options were provided to help recouping the lost funds for a flight that is still not for another 45 days as of this writing. Completely shameful, will not fly with AA ever again so long as I live. Plenty of other airlines out there."
392,"My husband and I were flying Jet Blue Christmas day from Orlando to Providence.  Our return flight was on Wednesday December 29th.  Of course, we found out in the morning that the flight was canceled, and we were already at the airport.  We needed to get home that day because our dog sitter couldn't stay with our dogs any longer and we had no one to step in.  The only available 2 seats for all the airlines were 2 first class (in reality they were business class (no WIFI available by the way.)  We were charged $3700.00, and it was nonstop!  Today we looked up the price of those tickets and they are listed at $500.00.  We were desperate to get home and felt we had no choice.   It wouldn't be right for me to write this and not add that the 2 agents at the ticket counter were so kind and were shocked at the price and tried several other avenues for us but there was nothing."
393,"The only way to talk to their call center is to request a callback. I did on Tuesday and an agent helped me book a flight from Seatac to Miami for Memorial Day 2022. I received a  confirmation number, but two days passed and I received no confirmation email and my debit card still didnt get charged. I searched the website. The booking was ""cancelled"".I had to call again and request a callback. The agent that got on the line with me said they weren't sure ""if the original agent knew what she was doing"" and the flight was only placed on hold and wasnt actually processed. She did offer to process a new booking which she did. But incorrectly. She scheduled a flight FROM Miami TO Seatac and back instead. Pretty disappointing level of competence. I cancelled my trip with this airline."
394,Male Gate agent out of Dallas to Miami flight AA477 told me he is a CROAnd walkers (I can‚Äôt walk without it more than a few steps) are not any priority and it must go under the plane. No it‚Äôs a problem I am first class executive and the walker will fit and goes on plane.He said I will never allow thatGot on flight head flight attendant put it in the closetEasy got off flight right away and super duper Male flight attendant graciously stored it and helped me off the planeWhat a great job it changed my attitude just cause gate agent is a jerk all the personnel are not.
395,"Worst flight experience ever with AA. I arrived with a 5 hours delay and my luggage was delivered 8 days after my arrival (8 days)! As a result I had no Christmas present for most of my families (they were in the suitcase) and had to buy loads of items. No compensation was even mentionned from them. The cause of the delay was a chaotic organization at the New Orleans airport. I was there 3 hours before my flight but they failed to check me in before flight time at 11am, like many  other people in the flight. The check-in queue was completely disorganized with loads of people with flights in the afternoon getting checked in before the people in the 11am flight. I ended up spending 15 hours at the airport, arrived 5 hours late at my final destination, and my luggage was delivered 8 days later.Absolutely avoid flying with them on transatlantic journey. European companies may be slightly more expensive but they are accountable by law in case of major delay or inconvenience. AA clearly just don't care."
396,I will never fly American Airlines ever again. Just an all-around terrible experience and too many bad things to list here. All I will say is that you should use a different airline for any travel you plan on doing!
397,"American Airlines is the absolute worst airlines to fly. They don‚Äôt care about me at all. They postponed a flight # 5300 for three plus hours, and didn‚Äôt give me a reason for the delay. Then, they took it upon themselves to change my seat. They didn‚Äôt consider me at all. I have commitments the next day that require me to be at work by 7:00am, but the airlines doesn‚Äôt care at all. They don‚Äôt hold themselves responsible for anything. You pay a pretty penny for an airlines ticket, but there is no accountability when things go south. The customer takes the hit, and has to absorb the impact on their work and personal impacts. It makes me want to buy another american airline ticket."
398,"The absolute worst customer service on the planet! I have traveled to take over 45 countries in the past 20 years and used numerous Airlines and american is by far the worst. I set out to purchase tickets to Thailand over two years ago which of course were canceled due to COVID that is not the airlines fault.  However, attempting to use those voucher tickets has surmounted to the most difficult task of a lifetime. I spent three hours on the phone with a woman over three months ago to have those voucher tickets relayed into tickets to London, however I never did receive an email. Somehow she never hit the ‚Äúsave‚Äú button. Therefore, there was no record, no saved tickets.  A few weeks ago I called back to speak to a very nice woman who did help me purchase tickets however she gave me two tickets leaving at one particular time and two having us leaving at a different time. I attempted to call to inquire only to be met with an angry customer service person. No help at all. I called back again just tonight only to speak to another frustrating agent. Nothing was resolved and no email sent even though it was promised.  Ahh, seriously?I am set to leave in less than 48 hours with still no email confirmation nor a verbal confirmation of the set time of the four tickets. Maddening!"
399,"Garbage Airline I think I flew 3 or 4 times with AA but this was my last for sure. Delays missed flights, stayed at nasty hotel, 12dollar voucher for food with no place to use it. Garbage service payed extra to upgrade seats just a garbage experience should have read the reviews."
400,"To say that traveling with American Airlines is quite possibly the worst airlines possible is an understatement. Please please please, you might think you‚Äôre getting a more affordable deal than with competing airlines, but you will get incurring and hidden fees. To prepare ahead of time so the flight goes smoothly will still not allow you to have a good experience or subpar even. Even when your negative Covid test is of the appropriate date, the airline representative said the test needs to be redone at the airport because the date might be correct but ‚Äúyou should have take the exam at 11pm and not at 1pm.‚Äù Mind you the date is correct. He immediately suggested the convenient Covid testing center at the airlines. The line once I got there was at least 100 people. How could over 100 people at this time not know they needed a test? Could it be possible that hundreds of people failed to read instructions properly? You have to wait in line, pay $250, they superficially and inadequately perform the PCR, so that everyone conveniently has a negative result. It‚Äôs upsetting to see that myself and others had the Covid test completed, with printouts and a negative result, only to be told that this test is better and it will cost 250 dollars and missing your flight. It‚Äôs upsetting when you have the negative results and they find the most arbitrarily reason to pay and not only that, it wasn‚Äôt performed to standard of care. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, the front desk checked me in and said my carry on luggage was appropriate to have as a carry on. This bag has been my carry on for numerous flights. Once boarding the flight, the flight rep that was scanning the ticket said the luggage was too large. As a matter of fact, it fits not only under the chair but as well as the overhead bin. Her desire to exercise her authority on baggage size only showed that her disrespectful behavior, as it became personal to her that she needed to be right rather than reasonably evaluating the bag that was within the carry on limits. What‚Äôs even more upsetting is she became belligerent and disrespectful before the bag was even placed in the carry on measuring apparatus. The employee argued condescendingly that it‚Äôs too tall, when the bag itself was appropriate. How did it pass when checking in and apparently now it got taller when boarding? She didn‚Äôt bother looking at the bag when I placed it to show her it fits in the measuring container, she was ready to start her threats of either following her instructions or not boarding the plane. American Airlines allows this type of disrespectful behavior from their employees, rather than advocating for the safety of their customers. American Airlines is anything but American. It is performing below the standard of care and certainly violates the codes of conduct that Americans uphold. If you‚Äôre looking for an experience short of a nightmare, choose the most unAmerican airlines, American Airlines."
401,"The pilot did not fill out proper paperwork which in turn made multiple passengers miss their layovers. This is highly unprofessional and inconsiderate to everyone on the flight. Since this flight I am discouraged to file with American airline again. Positive,  Louise at Dallas airport helped me get a new flight and was an angel."
402,"American airlines refused to accept a valid COVID test, so we had to get another test where they told us to go. Then we missed our connecting flight waiting in customs because they rescheduled us with inadequate time to connect our flight, missed the connecting flight due to their poor planning, now we are stuck in the Miami airport, on standby for at least 8 hours due to this ridiculous superiority complex about their COVID tests. I am so furious right now I could scream. None of this was our fault, but they hire such inept, pointless, arbitrary rule enforcing nobodies, its not surprising to see the videos of staff incidents all over the web. Maybe retrain your people to focus on customer service instead of self important covid gate keepers. No one gave you this power, but you took it anyway."
403,"I travel twice a month for work and fly southwest or American Airlines. I typically don‚Äôt reviews however, the failure of customer service is very apparent at American Airlines. Your employee all have attitudes and are extremely rude. I‚Äôm not sure if you hire people like this or if American treats them poorly that they hate working there. I can mention a lot of example that I have personally seen the staff disrespect the other passengers or myself. I will continue to fly Southwest as much as possible. Southwest employees have great attitudes, they make jokes & laugh. It is pleasure flying southwest every time. I highly recommend American considering hire people who want to be there and have a smile on their face. American has lost me as a member."
404,"I want to give American Airlines a great compliment in the way they treated my son who is a Sailor and needed to travel back overseas. Delta treated my son poorly at the Love Field airport and my son ended up having to book another flight but could only find one on American Airlines. American Airlines treated my son with respect and made sure he checked in through the priority line rather than having to wait in a very long line.. They also made sure he went in through TSA‚Äôs Pre-check line rather than having to wait in the long line. First of all, thank you for the respect you gave my son, and secondly, thank you for giving us some relief after a hectic morning. We are very appreciative to your staff at the DFW airport."
405,"I have been skeptical of American Airlines for the 2021 year, however this trip was different. At the ticket counter in Charlotte NC Christopher at Main Ticket counter was able to get me on an earlier flight. When I arrived to the gate it seemed that the flight was full and I would be on standby. Other passengers were demanding with words but The gate agent Antonio at B4 handled each swing of words politely. Word of advice to passengers ask politely and you might just get your request granted.Thank you Antonio for being mindful of your customers and being professional and standing firm!"
406,"This airline has the absolute worst customer service that I have ever encountered!  This company cares nothing about the customers, and after repeated issues with them over the past four months, I will never fly with them again!  Every level of customer service has been terrible, from the airport level to the corporate level. Despite the huge hit the airline industry has takes due to covid, the majority of flights that I have taken with American since September 2020 (approximately 25 flights) have been problematic.  They have cancelled countless flights, the staff has been outrageously rude and speaking with a representative is almost impossible.  I have had flights cancelled and rescheduled, through no fault or choice of my own, and in doing so have been downgraded from business class and refunded next to nothing.  Corporate does nothing and cares only about the financial bottom line, with no thought to the customer experience.  Do yourself a favor‚Äî save yourself the time, money and stress, and fly with ANY other airline other than American!!"
407,"My party of four flew American from London to San Diego with a change over in Chicago in November 2021. We flew in economy (coach). Prior to departure, I had a number of points that needed clarification and I found the AA app really easy to use. The chat facility in the app was excellent and had real people behind the chat who were knowledgeable and very helpful. The chat facility was available throughout the day and night and I highly commend the chat aspect of the service.We used VeriFLY as recommended to conduct our pre-departure checks such as Covid documents and this worked smoothly. The check-in agent at Heathrow informed us that two of our check-in bags were over laden. She was polite about this and allowed us the flexibility to redistribute the load across bags which we did. She also let us know that AA weren‚Äôt very flexible with overweight baggage and again this was helpful - our flight was also full which I suppose reduces flexibility. We had paid extra for exit row seats and these were comfortable enough and the legroom was appreciated. The food and drink service was good enough and better than expected. There was a good choice of entertainment and I especially liked the short films. The earphones that were distributed for use with the entertainment system were very poor quality and I would have preferred an option to pair my AirPods. As Chicago was our first port of entry to the USA, then having cleared immigration our bags had to be picked up and dropped bag off for the second leg of the journey to San Diego. This process was simple enough and the bags were already checked in to the final destination, so it was simply a case of picking up from one carousel and dropping off at another conveyer which was well signed. Both sets of flights ran to time and without delay. At San Diego International Airport (SAN), our bags arrived and three out of the four bags were substantially damaged. The bags were brand new for this trip and damage was significant and deliberate. One bag was so deformed that it seemed like some machinery had compressed it. Some of the damage was incomprehensible, such as the front pocket zipper being torn at the stitching level. The bags were also dirty. The ground assistance was helpful. The gentleman offered to replace the bags there and then. He had a size that was smaller in size to the ones that we had brought and we had to make a pragmatic decision to accept what was on offer as there was no other choice. A telling indicator was that the ground agent had cupboards full of new suitcases waiting to be issued. This must be a recurring problem. I‚Äôm not entirely sure if the problem is with AA or the airport baggage handling. I am however aware that friends that joined us later in the week had a very similar experience."
408,"Hello Everyone, I have been loyal customers for American airlines for years and a membership. Unfortunately on Sunday 24th October,  I traveled from Saint Louis Lambert International airport STL, I arrived at the check point to register my luggage. Two agents from American airlines asked to pay for luggage fee amount $75, I explained them the ticket I bought, said 2 carry on free and 1 luggage.  They did not allow me to explain them. Then they told me I will be charge once again on the return flight on the 18th November 2021 at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport CDG.I was charge again for the amount $75.08. Even though I showed them the email for the agency. The director for the customer service at the airport did not care  at all.Please find the extract email with agency:Objet : Re: Re : Re : Introduction to AsapTickets HI Sir , upon checking your ticket includes 1 bag free and 2 carryon free then for the 2nd bag there is additional charge which you need to pay at the airport upon check in.That is within the Airlines already. Sorry I can't call you SIr because you have an international number that I can't call, but we can communicate by email.American airlines did not care about it.On the 18th November 2021, several incidents happened at the airport Charles de Gaulle CDG, before I check my luggage,  one agent from American airlines asked me my passport and I give to her. Unfortunately she was not professional,  she asked several questions totally ridiculous,  where do you live? Which company do you work? Despite I showed her my passport. She did not care. Then she put an orange ticket on my boarding pass. After I went to the customs guard, the officer was si professional, veyind and above unlike American agents. I personally congratulated him and he made the difference with quality of service. At the boarding stand,  after I passed the stand before I boarded on the plane,  they checked me again and again. There American airlines agents were rude and unprofessional. They rushed me to get into the plane. When I got on the plane, I found only one stewardess,  her name was Susan.  She was so professional and I explained her the all history, the incidents which occurred at the airport on the 24th October and 18 November 2021. She listened to me. American airlines needs to change management,  otherwise the company will start to lose customers. In near future, I will travel other companies Delta airlines,  Air France etc...Only Susan was professional. I hope sincerely American airlines will review its management and take deep concern.I have already sent to American airlines, my concerns.  Once again,  the company does not care, even though give them my fully explanation. They did not take it in credit. I traveled every year. I will not ever travel with American airlines. I was loyal customer.  I do not want to travel with American airlines. Sincerely, Quentin"
409,"My wife bought 2 tickets through Iberia, ticket was AA. She even paid an extra ¬£200 for some flexibility to change if necessary 10 days before. She was given notification that her return flight had changed. After checking the details it was extremely difficult with layover times as she is travelling with a child. My wife started searching for an alternative flight and found her original return flight in American Airlines website ‚ÄúBlack Friday sale‚Äù for significantly more money. After 2 hours on the phone with Iberia nothing was fixed.To summarise, my wife and daughter are returning a week later than planned with no  additional costs just inconvenience.AA have not only manipulated the sale for Black Friday, they have taken my wife‚Äôs flight off her without permission and inconvenienced many family members.The trust pilot rating for AA is justified if this is how they treat their UK customers. AA you are a disgrace of a business"
410,"I've been a loyalty member for almost 20 years.I asked for a refund for my preferred seat purchase on two different flights (same trip) because I had to ""voluntarily"" move to accommodate another passenger in my aisle seat both times. A passenger that AA should have never allowed to purchase a middle/window seat - but I was expected to move for them...and ended up moving.They declined my refund. Wasn't asking for a total refund, just on my preferred seat charge.They'd rather loose a customer over less than $200 than refund a long-standing customer their money.Sad, sad airline."
411,"Hi,Me and my family could not use our flights (4 seats) due to a unforeseen event, not COVID related but more Visa related. I contacted AA late, thinking they would not help us. They did, extending the flights so we can use them on the future. Then, I realised they the max time they give us ,12pm the, felt sort of our travel plans next year, so I kindly asked them for an extra-extra extension, without much expectations. To our surprise they extended even more so we would be able to use them. Really impressed with their CS specially when non of this is their fault.  Ever used them before but now I will since they went the extra-extra mile for us."
412,I will never ever fly this airline again the worst ride of my life kids screaming jumping in and out they seat airline stewartest did nothing flirts class delta from now on
413,"This is my 4th time in American Airlines its one of the worst airlines in terms of customer service.Infact I would say bunch of racist gathered in one place.Having travelled in almost all domestic airlines and some of the best international airlines I definitely know what to expect from an airline interms of customer service.I had couple of instances from my first flight I asked for direction to the airport lounge at the Austin airport at a guy standing in Gate 24 and he was like its on the first floor and I wanted to make sure its not far off as I had to attend a meeting and get back to my gate right after it for the flight,and this man started laughing as if I was a fool who didn‚Äôt understand what he was talking about.Second incident was at the front desk the old man just kept throwing passport and my resident card very irrespecutful.And the third incident inside the airline I was sleeping while they had come for the water service and was not thirsty at that point so didnt bother getting anything once We were about to land the flight I walked up to the people behind and asked them for a glass of water and she was commenting after all this you want water and I was like I slept during the flight so couldn‚Äôt get water.Seriously these people need serious customer training service very rude and racist airlines."
414,Very careless customer service. Did not explain and charged money from the card on file when I was just asking questions.
415,"Based on a recent review of my company's relationship with American Airlines we have decided to end our exclusive relationship with AAA as the carrier of choice. In 2020 we spent more than $20,000 in business flights in promoting our books. Our decision was based in part on the performance of the carrier and the sliding lack of customer service and carrier passenger safety. Should AAA improve we will reconsider our decision in September 2022 at our next corporate meeting. Our decision was also based in part on information obtained from The Better Business Bureau and Trustpilot reviews."
416,Worst airline! How are they still in business? Crappy customer service. You get what you pay for. They lost my luggage and claimed never had it checked in? I show them proof of my luggage tag showing I had one. Got my luggage after 2 weeks. What a joke!
417,"American Airlines has been our Airlines , when we do make those trips to see our Darling Daughter & Beautiful Grandkids in Texas .Only wish they had more direct flights from Cleveland, Ohio üá∫üá∏Hope they take better care of the AA Advantage miles members ‚Ä¶ Hence the 4 ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è Glad AA is being more pro active with unruly passengers ..

418,"Greetings,Let me start off by saying that I regretted ever having Americans Airlines as my number one choice to fly for this trip VLDZFG. I‚Äôve been flying American Airlines since the late 1990‚Äôs and early 2000‚Äôs back and forth into Haiti with my family with no issues. The time I decided to choose American Airlines to fly to a particular trip into Thailand, they not only let me down. But when I showed up at the check-in desk at the airport the lady checking my bags told that my connecting flight into Japan to Thailand is not going to happen because Japan is closed and not allowing tourist to connect through it. The American Airlines Agent noted my file telling me about the cancelation of my flight saying that Japan is going to open Nov 15,2021. I‚Äôve book this ticket since October 1, 2021, I prepared in advance with my job to get the requested time off and now your going to tell me that a major company that I trusted and believe in since I was a child deceive me into purchasing the ticket to Thailand when they know that the connecting flight was not valid. That is just unacceptable in all accounts, you don‚Äôt sell tickets to customers that is going to deceive them, that‚Äôs a big red flag and dirty business. Taking the customers trust, and misleading to purchase tickets to later give them flight credit is a scam to the customer. As a major company that represents the United States in the Airline industry you don‚Äôt deceive your customers into purchasing something that is for future use, that is not fair and not the American way of doing business, we call that a scam. Also to make matters worse, I spoke to the reservation agent and supervisor at American Airlines about the issue, they told me to submit a request for refund and I would receive my funds back to my card because of the matter, because they had to cancel my flight. I check my email this morning in Thailand, and the email said your ticket is not eligible for refund 0012302169199. I want to American Airlines and I would never thought I would ever come on here to write such review because of the high regards I had, but you‚Äôre a scam to deny my refund of funds to my card and offer flight miles when you arrange a connecting flight that was not possible because Japan is closed off to tourist, American Airlines that is a scam. I would never forget this or trust you guys, and yes Delta does have valid routes into Thailand connecting through South Korea, I was able to fly through Delta and be in Thailand as I once planned. I want my funds refunded back to my card and want to fly American Airlines ever again if your going to scam me out of my money by giving me flight miles. I‚Äôve work hard for that money not to have back to my card. I want my money back. I didn‚Äôt cancel the flight you guys did. I want my money back, that is not fair dealing with customers like this. Why deceive customers into purchasing your tickets to your business and give them the service. That is dirty business dealing. I want my funds refunded back into my card, I do not want your air miles. That is not the way to go with a customer because of your own mistakes, I want my money back. You don‚Äôt gain a customer trust by doing that. I want my funds back to my card please. I don‚Äôt want to be scam. And if I don‚Äôt get it, I‚Äôll make sure the world knows of how dirty you guys are doing business. That is not fair. I want my funds back into my card."
419,The airline itself I've never had an issue with. It is trying to do anything online/the app or calling in to customer service. The phone system always encourages you to go online to do your transactions but then when you try AA NEVER completes it! There's always something wrong with the website or please try again at a later time. Maybe you wouldn't have atrocious call times if you let us complete something as simple as a flight change online without issue. I literally have tried over 6 times to do it myself and every time I got the same error. Now I'm inconvenienced having to wait over an hour for a call back. Horrible service structure and oxy moronic as  well.
420,"Horrible experience. Flight delays causing missed connections. Told to get a hotel voucher when arriving at next stop only to stand in customer service line for over two hours.  Still waiting for next flight on the following day which of course is delayed again. A trip that was scheduled to be 4.5 hours is now over 24 hours and waiting. Would highly recommend another airline. I would give ""0"" stars if possible."
421,"November 10th, flight from Las Vegas to Charlotte was cancelled outright, after sittinig inairport and experiencing ""updated"" delays for 6 hours.  Then, AA lost my baggage.  Fihally delivered by Taxi, 8 hours later.  On the 10th my wife and I finally returned to Charlotte and flight thru Austin, Tx  Flt uneventful but, once again, AA lost my luggage.  When spending antother mind numbingly amount of time in baggage dept with a group of AA employees who asked me twice if I had a weapon in bag (I did not) I was issued a tracker for luggage which they were showing was still in Las Vegas.  They informed me I could track bag and it would be delivered, along with my meds (I'm in my late 60s) to my home 3 1/2 hours away.  When home, I logged on to check status and NOTHING.  Error.  NO bag.  Now, as I sit here typing this, I cannot speak with anyone at AA and I get NOTHING from the bag tracking service because they want numbers from the bag tags that the AA employee in baggage took from me while in Charlotte.American Airlines appears to be a Fred Sanford type comedy skit.  Pretty sure I'll be speaking with attorney/newssites/elected US Senator tomorrow as I have never seen anything like this in my life."
422,"American Airlines has some of the worst service/customer service I‚Äôve ever experienced. They offered Vouchers for flights during the covid pandemic but only let you redeem the vouchers at ticket centres located in the airport. We went back 3 times before someone was actually at the desk and waited 2 hours to get our money. It is a total scam they make it so difficult, I‚Äôm sure they hope you will lose your vouchers or just give up. To make matters worse I called and left messages 4 times abs not once did anyone call me back. Such a simple gesture would have changed my opinion of the whole situation but this just goes to show they are just another corporate hog and all they care about is money."
423,"This had to be the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had, I‚Äôm heavily pregnant travelling with and infant and a toddler, I‚Äôve had to stay in a Que for over 1hour and 30 mins to then be seen to find out that I can not upgrade my ticket or me and my son would not be sitting together, at the front seat they said I should speak to the persons at the gate and asked to be changed. When arriving at the gates they changed my ticket to find out that they place me by the window we‚Äôre they know I‚Äôm travelling with an infant under one who will need a Travel cot that the airline provides for infant when travelling, once I got on t plane I come to realise that the plane is half full and there was no one with a baby on that plane but me so I don‚Äôt know when the air hostess was giving me a hard time and did not want to change my seat I was really disappointed and frustrated with this as I expected better service from American airline the cabin crew was rude as aswel and did not know what they was going it took two crew members to fit up the travel cot as one couldn‚Äôt do it and he gave me the wrong information regarding the seats when asked to be changed was really really disappointed in the service honestly. Will not be travelling with them again"
424,eff you american airlines i hope you get shut down

426,"We had planned our dream trip, which quickly became a travel in vain due to the horrendous planning and customer service of American Airlines. We are still waiting for our full refund. We have attempted numerous contacts to American Airlines through various modes, but were are posting here because of American Airline's disrespectful and avoidant choice to deny loyal customers a phone line through which to call American Airlines to resolve issues. American Airlines refunded us a tiny fraction of our flight costs, and anything less than a full refund for our trip is unacceptable. We were put out exceedingly more than that small amount by being stranded in another city overnight (while missing our jobs and children), and by having to rent a car and drive from a city over 6 hours away from where we were supposed to be landing. American Airlines needs to refund the entire trip, and future flyers need to be informed of American Airline's horrible customer service, avoidance of customers by making contact almost impossible, and refusal to fully compensate their customers after all they put the customers through. Until American Airlines can treat its customers with full respect, dignity, and compensation, we warn everyone to avoid flying American and tangling your time and money into a journey in vain.¬† The total amount in damages done by American Airlines for our travels to and from our destination is $1,949.03, which we will need in a cash refund as soon as possible. Our flights alone were almost $1,000, and we have not even had that refunded yet. Not even to mention the adverse mental, emotional, and physical health impacts this experience had on us. We will be waiting for your call and refund, American Airlines."
427,"Booked a trip to Hawaii. On the flight home, we got stranded at the connecting airport about 2,500 miles from home with the choice of staying in Dallas for 2 days at our own expense or sleeping on the airport floor awaiting a flight, or making it home on our own. We forked out $415 to get home, American Airlines refunded us $89 after 3 and a half hours of negotiating."
428,"I expected to flight back to Chicago on Sunday Oct 31, came to the airport around 2hrs early before the departure time 3:15 and got the text message that they cancelled our flight. We waited in the line for 2Hrs to rebook it on the next day Monday Nov 1 at 3:39 to Seatles, and 11:59pm from Seatles to Chicago on Nov 2 at 6am as their suggestion. But the connecting flight to Seatles was delayed for over 1.5 hrs due to tech problem, and when we got to Seatles at 8pm, and they said our 11:59pm flight got cancelled and rebooked it to us at 5am on nov2, arrive at Ohare at 11:45, which means I‚Äôm gonna miss another work day. No hotel voucher or anything, we just sat and slept on the chair from 8-4am. We spent almost 3 days at the airport due to their worse operation and unprofessional lame excuses regarding understaff due to holiday and bad weather. Dude, United Airline and other airlines are still operating. And if their staff had ask for vacation off, then the airline should know it in advance and should announce it earlier so their passengers could find alternative solution. They only announced us via text right few hrs before departure time. I parked at the airport and I bet I would have to pay a lot for the parking fee and I get paid by hrs which means no pay check for these 2 days."
429,Booked direct flightFirst they cancelled it 2 hours before the flight without warning or reason Than no flight for 24 hoursThan they gave me a connecting flight next day Missed my appointments Stress and mental problems
430,"I booked a flight for two people, well in advance. A couple of weeks later, upon looking at my confirmation, it had the date incorrect by one day. I had to cancel these two flights and rebook for the correct date. I don't know whether the error was mine or AA's.  Since the price had increased, I had to pay an additional $202 for each flight, plus $21.62 each for a seat. The only seats available were aisle seats 18C and 18D. Since when do you have to pay for aisle seats? These seats were category 7, almost the last to board. Were these really ""preferred"" seats? It would have been good for public relations if AA had honored the price of the first flight, and not charged for a category 7 seat. This is the first and last time my friend and I will travel on American Airlines."
431,"This is my 23 time flights with American Airlines anytime when I flight there are always a problem someway somehow, they are cheating on me all the time the early morning flight when they don't have customers they just remove and said delayed and put everyone together with the next flight and this make all my plans need to change all the time!!!!"
432,"I‚Äôd like to give 0 stars, but unfortunately I need to give one away for free. Delays, unfriendly staff, and way too many questions traveling from Colombia to US. WHAT? Asking personal things to let me board the plane? Once I already have my ticket. That‚Äôs not airline job, buddy. It‚Äôs the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. I‚Äôd never use again AA if I could."
433,They are by far the worst worst worst airlines to EVER exist. Absolutely pathetic. No value of time OR customers. At all. So sick of the delays delays no reason. Never ever want to fly them again. Ever.Pathetic does not even begin to describe what a nuisance this airline is.
434,Horrible!! They delay the flight on the runway and MAKE YOU MISS your connecting flights! What is the purpose of arriving to the airport early to miss your connecting flight due to ‚Äútraffic on the runway?!?‚Äù This is beyond our control and should not be tolerated !
435,"If I could give American Airlines a 0 I would. I bought a ticket for my mother n law but when I entered the credit card by memory it changed her name to my name as the passenger which I didn't notice. I called American Airlines and they said they can't help me I have to send an email which seems crazy that they don't equip their reps to handle this. I sent an email and they say i can change the name but my mother n law has to get an American Airlines Advantage number which seems incredibly odd and inconvenient but she does. It try to call back multiple times but the hold times are long and I miss their calls when they call back. I reach out a third time with a hold with the number they gave me from the customer service email, they have a hold time of 3 HOURS!!!!. I call and explain and they say they aren't the right department and transfer me and now I've been on hold for 40+ minutes. Why the hell didn't customer service give me the right number to the right department. THIS IS CRAZY!!!!! After my next scheduled flight I WILL NEVER FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES AGAIN"
436,No surprise to see that all the review are so bad as I was boarding my flight to Vegas for my wedding I was told been Jen who refuse to give me her last name and say she the manager that I was not allowed to bring on my carry on bad due to the fact that I had my wedding day suit with me when asked why she stated your not I then proceed to see 4 white male allowed to carry on all their bags plus more when I asked her why they were allowed she stated they are fine funny how racism still goes on in this world I will never fly American again and neither will anyone I know I was left speech less and I will keep posting until that racist lady is fired
437,American Airlines changed my flight and then refused to refund the ticket.. Horribly unprofessional customer services as well.
438,"Awful...they need to close this Airline company down, been sitting on plane for 3 hours waiting to take off with clear weather.  They are a pure example of how liberals will show up to work but once they are there they are useless."
439,This issues with American Airlines cancelling flights has to stop.  People book flights to be taken to their final destination not to hear 4 hours before departure that your flight is cancel.  BTW this cancelation was not weather related.  We were told there was not enough crew.  So why sell the flight if you do not have crew.  This is disrespectful to your customers.  this is the third flight that gets cancelled on me this year for lack of crew.  I will think twice before I schedule with American Airlines again.
440,"0ct 21st my 2nd leg of my flight cancelled.  (Along with many others).Everyone that I dealt with were kind and helpful!  I received vouchers for motel, taxie, (to and from motel) along with a food voucher.And I was rerouted - was not what I had planned - but customer service was great.   My luggage was sent to a different airport (as I was going to fly there but I changed that as there was a seat in the morning of the airport I originally Was going too)My luggage was delivered to me!!!!!We are all human - and things sometimes not in our control.  But I was treated good and things worked out. I wish I could thank each and everyone personally who assisted me!"
441,"10/25/21 - American Airline changed the aircraft at last minute. I get that and understand that things happen. That said, they bumped me from 1st class, shoved a voucher in my face and rudely cattle-called me on my way without any representative taking a minute to answering questions I had about another flight. It seamed as though they were going out of their way to treat me as a non-person, just another schmuck that was unlucky enough to entrust American with his travel needs. I am finished with American Airlines...Hello Delta!"
442,"Worse airline to deal with, lost our luggage, and not issuing any credit. Flight delayed for over 8 hours and no compensation, ended up with connecting flights. Long hold times on the phone. Expect to wait over hour and hours if you want to speak with someone."
443,Missed my connecting fly in DFW due to maintenance issue with our plain in Ohio. While at DFW one of American Airlines representative by the name of Flore was very helpful. He got us on the next possible flight. He also got us a hotel and meal vouchers. My granddaughter and I really appreciate his willingness to work with us. Thank you Mr. Flores for making a difficult situation a little better.
444,"Today (October 23, 2021) we were headed back to Ohio, leaving from Maui. The morning of the flight they moved the time of the flight from 6:10pm to 8:50pm Maui time. We had to turn in our rental car at 5pm. When we got to the airport at 4:15 they wouldn't let us check our bags until 3 hours before loading time (loading time was 8:05pm so we had to wait in no air conditioning until 5:05pm to check our bags. Then we get through security and are sitting at the gate when they announce at 5:45pm that our flight 116 is canceled. So they told us over the intercoms to get our bags and go to the check-in counter. We go down to the carousel where the bags for our flight is suppossed to be and our bags are nowhere to be found. After waiting around the baggage carousel for 30 minutes we still see nothing. So we go to the check-in counter where there is a HUGE line. We waited in this line for 2 HOURS and in that time they have only helped 3 customers. I walk up and asked one of the customers what they were doing and they were handing out vouchers for food and hotel stays. It was taking on average 45 minutes per customer and we were about 30 people back in line so we booked a flight through Alaskan airlines and they got us back home on a Sunday, October 24th. This is the most unexceptable experience ive ever had with an airline. We were standing in no air conditioning for 4 hours in 85 degree weather, had to go through security twice, and not once did we even get a simple apology. I hope this company goes under so they can be forced to stop screwing over their customers. Will never fly with this company again and will vehemently campaign against this airline to anyone who will listen."
445,"This episode happened recently in Kansas City.  I have been flying American Airlines for 20 years. I have generally been satisfied.  I fly for business and I pack accordingly. My luggage are bought specifically to fit as carry on.  I was shocked and dismayed by a recent episode.  I was asked to check my bag at the gate because of size.  In years of flying, I have never had a problem fitting my bag on any size plane.  I put my bag in the big sizer and it completely fit, but the gate agent continued to force me to check the bag.  No one else was asked to do this despite obviously larger bags.  I felt singled out because of my race.  This makes me late for my conference meeting.  I am shocked and disappointed by the rudeness of American Airlines employees."
446,Trying to use AA credit before it expires. Lady on the phone treated me like I was a 2 year old. I would have hung up but the hold time was so long I had to decide between being humiliated and starting over with someone else. I chose humiliation. :(
447,Never ever will I flight on this flight again. My flight was originally leaving  Las Vegas to Charlotte at 945 am and getting to Charlotte  at 5:30 which happen when I got to Charlotte everything went to the left I was suppose to be leaving Charlotte NC at 631pm and getting to Richmond at 745 pm but american airlines told us the plane delay until 8:45pm then when 8:45 pm came they told us it's moved to 9:15 then when that came it changed to 9:45 pm now it changed to 10pm now we waiting on a plane to come in from Pittsburgh then they have to service that before they can tell us if we can fly on that one now I don't know what time we getting to Richmond at this time so angry never taking this flight again don't recommend anyone to flight with American Airlines worst flight company ever.
448,this is the worst airlines to work with this is not the first time it happened while filling my information and ready to pay the prices doubled !! that's a scam ! it like dealing with random cheap airline flights !!! be careful the price you see its not the price you will be paying !!! worst company to flight with anyways !!!
449,"No such thing as customer service, closed the door in my face! Do not fly with these clowns unless you do not have to be somewhere & like sitting around in airports! They do not care"

When we pushed back, the morons at the gate counted the passengers wrong, so we sat on the tarmac just outside the gate for 20 minutes while they tried to figure out where 2 extra passengers came from‚Ä¶.total morons‚Ä¶.clueless.  That 20 minutes delay put us on the ground at 5:45.  Then we started rolling to the gate‚Ä¶still had a chance, but there was a plane parked at our gate, so we sat for another 25 minutes on the tarmac at CLT.  By the time we got to the gate, our second flight was gone.  Now our only choice is to sit at the airport in masks for 6 hours waiting for a midnight flight, and there is no first class available, even though I paid for first class. Talking to customer service‚Ä¶nothing we can do, if we get you home within 24 hours of your scheduled arrival, we pay for nothing.  And I am out the cost of the first class tickets.   Sitting here right now.  We will be lucky to be home by 1:45 AM and I have meetings at 8:30.  And we were blessed with an $82 dinner of 2 crappy salads.  American Airlines does not give a crap about their customers.  In addition to losing 7 hours of my life and the crappy $82 dinner, I will have to pay a cab double because it will be after midnight.Avoid American Airlines at all costs. They suck beyond words and they DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU!!!"
452,prior to covid American Airlines screwed me out of 2 days vacation in Ireland I hope you people die a slow painful death from an incurable plague that kills your whole family thank you for your time.
453,"My niece had to fly AA from Amarillo to DFW on Oct 4 and Oct 11 to meet up with me to fly Alaska Air. Let me first preface ALASKA AIR was amazing both trips! My niece has terminal cancer and I wanted to make sure she had a good experience seeing family in Oregon and Washington before cancer cuts her life short, but American messed up that experience big time! First, she can't walk very far due to cancer eating up her spine and other parts of her body and I made sure she had assistance getting to the planes.  On flt AA5859, 10/4, they dropped her off at 3 different AA gates, keep in mind she was headed to ALASKA AIR and I was assured I didn't need to worry about AA getting her to my ALASKA gate! She said SHE had to keep reminding the assistant it wasn't AA terminal but ALASKA TERMINAL. Finally she got an assistant to follow thru to pick up luggage AND HER and go to ALASKA AIR!  Then on return AA flight 5977, 10/11, the assistant argued with ME on the process of getting her from ALASKA to AA Terminal so I realized she needed my help to get her  assistance AGAIN. WE were, then taken to the orange Terminal bus dumped our 2 checked bags and 2 carried on bags! Keep in mind I'm 76 and she can't walk far! The orange van then dumps us 2 entrances away from AA and I HAVE TO FIND HELP! I did find someone but she acted perturbed to have to look up from her phone. She did seem concerned when she saw my niece struggling to stand to sit in wheelchair. The last assistant did get my niece thru Security and the gate, but let me tell you I'll only fly AA to use up my FF miles. Alaska Air is my choice of travel.‚úåüëç"
454,"On our way to the airport, we receive a notification that the flight would be delayed an hour. After getting to the airport it was delayed another 3 times. The flight was so late, that I would miss my connecting flight. When I asked an employee if the connecting flight would hold for me, I was yelled at. I would have gotten to my destination so late, the car rentals would be closed. I was forced to take a flight the next day, losing the money spent on the prepaid hotel, my loss in wages and the time and money spent going back. On the flight I had water spilled on me by the flight attendant and was tossed a couple of napkins. When I emailed American about this, I received nothing but a canned reply. I will try and avoid this airline at all costs"
455,"They change flights, unreliable...  I canceled my flight after they changed it to an inconvenient time.  Booking with Southwest now"
456,"Paid for upgraded seats, got bumped back to standard seats, when I asked why, I was offered $300 and a voucher to take a different flight later in the day, but otherwise they were not refunding the seats I paid for and they didn't really care at all about stealing my money and not offering me the services I paid for. This is my 2nd experience with AA in the last 30 days to have this happen. It will be my last time flying AA. I may pay more on other airlines but at least I get the services I paid for. I'd say AA should be ashamed of how they treat people, but when you've become the Wal-Mart of the skies it comes with the territory."
457,"They snatch defeat from the jaws of victory!Travelled to Tampa from Manchester UK via Heathrow and Chicago mid September. This was Business trip. Arrived in Chicago to be told my bag did not make it from Heathrow. Great, only had the clothes I‚Äôd been travelling in all day when arrived at Tampa. Was told the bag would follow the same route the day after. Called Tampa airport AA baggage to confirm (these people did try to help) no bag arrived. I then spent all day Friday, Sat trying to find were the bag was, it is a horrible feeling not knowing if you will see it again. AA kept confirming it was at Heathrow but it did not move. Obviously I had to by new clothes over the weekend spending my time shopping (Not my most favourite pastime).Bag finally arrived 4 days later after 2 trips to the airport.I submitted my receipts for the extra clothes and they accepted but you have to wait up to 4 working weeks for payment, why?But the best thing, the kick in the teeth was, I was 3lbs overweight due to these extra clothes and they charged me 87 dollars for an issue they had created. When I politely explained with emails from AA the jobsworth at Tampa said ‚Äúthat was then, this is now‚Äù how is it not related? Should I have left all the clothes at the hotel?Also I emailed the person who looked after the claim 3 days before I flew to ask if the fee could be waived. I got the reply just after I had checked in saying no, cowardly at best. I have been doing this trip for many years and have been AA platinum in the past. Please refund me the 87 dollars."
458,I am struggling to understand why this company is unable to provide me with a functioning email link to redeem a $50 voucher.  Corresponding with customer relations via email isn't working and phone agents claim they cannot help.  This is a bizarre way to operate an airline.
459,Do not fly American Airlines. I had three flights canceled within  two weeks. These cancellations were announced within hours of the flight taking off. I missed my brothers wedding. Then I decided to fly my brother out and both of his flights were cancled-resulting in missed days of work and multiple trips to the airport for both of us. American Airlines is very unprofessional and I would recommend upgrading to Delta to ensure your flight is not canceled.
460,"Out of fairness, as mentioned, this is not a recent story.  It's actually a fairly old story, although the first time shared on a review site.   I contacted AA after it occurred and again, years later, since it has bothered me for many years.  They essentially told me to pound said each time.  The first time, I think they threw 500 AAdvantage miles our way, but it didn't make up for the negative experience.My prior girlfriend had a handicapped parking permit due to a botched hip surgery when she was young.  She also had a serious and potentially life-threatening disease known as Marfan's Syndrome.She had some walking difficulty to begin with (walked with a limp), but on our trip, she had injured her ankle and it was swollen to roughly 50% larger than normal.We approached the American Airlines gate agent in Dallas Ft. Worth, explained that she was having trouble walking, and we asked to pre-board.  The gate agent looked at her sternly and said, ""I'll need to see your Doctor's note"".  We told her that it had just occurred on our trip, but that she also had a handicapped permit.  The gate agent said, ""I don't care what kind of permit you have, Doctor's note or else you can board with everyone else!""We offered to show her the ankle, since it was obviously injured and swollen.  The gate agent said, ""I don't want to see your ankle, I want to see your Doctor's note.  If you don't have one, I'll need you to take a seat"".It was annoying, but we waited our turn.  Finally they called for boarding.  When it was time to board, the gate agent literally ran over to the lady taking the tickets and said, ""That bag gets checked!"", pointing to my (then) girlfriend's bag.  We argued that it was a standard 20"" carry-on and that it fit and met regulations.  We also didn't want to check it because it was a nice bag that was a gift from me and a light color which might stain if checked.She walked it over to the spacer and it fit perfectly fine.  She insisted on checking it anyway, insisting that it didn't fit.  I politely argued, saying it was in the spacer, so how could she say it didn't fit?  She said, ""Only because you shoved it in there"", which was untrue.I asked for a supervisor and he could not have cared less.Then, we boarded, but there was no flight crew.  Nor was there any air conditioning.All of the passengers sat on that flight sweating for 45 minutes to an hour.  Finally the flight crew arrived. We were hot, miserable and pretty unhappy.Once onboard, the gate agent came onto the plane and spoke to a male flight attendant.  It was obvious that she was talking about my (then) girlfriend and me.  She seemingly painted us as unreasonable troublemakers, rather than the victims of American Airlines' treatment, and she wanted to make darn sure they knew it so they could treat us poorly, just as we ""deserved"".  Not only discriminating against a handicapped (and further injured) woman, but retaliating against her by forcing her to check her carry-on bag, and further retaliating by trying to make us look bad in the flight attendant's eyes.  And yes, the flight attendants treated us like garbage for the entire flight, with a very cold attitude.  After all, we were problem passengers, as confirmed by the gate agent.  Very unreasonable people, don't you know?To make matters worse, they lost my bags, although they later found them.  They also damaged my (then) girlfriend's bag.I wrote a letter to American complaining about our experience.  They sent me back a form letter, offering me 500 Advantage miles, which is nothing.I still fly American and I've had some good experiences too, but the treatment by their DFW staff really left a bad taste in my mouth."

462,"Changed my flight disrupting my entire trip to Aruba for our anniversary.  Because they amended my my flight schedule by 3 hours instead of 4, they won't refund.  Had to take another carrier.  Here's the BS Lee Cole emailed me:  September 18, 2021Hello Mr. Searles:Thanks for reaching out to us. I am sorry to hear that the schedule change for your flight to Aruba has caused disruptions in your travel plans. I appreciate the opportunity to review and address your concerns. Mr. Searles, sometimes we have to make adjustments to our operation, and between the time you book and the day you are scheduled to depart, there may be changes. If we fail to operate or delays your arrival more than 4 hours, our sole obligation is to refund the remaining ticket value and any optional fees according to our involuntary refunds policy. Unfortunately, we must respectfully decline your request for a refund as the schedule change does not fall within our refund policy within the conditions of carriage. Please know that your ticket is valid from one year from the date of issuance for travel with us.  I would like to assure you that we take all of our customers' concerns and feedback seriously. The comments that you shared with me today will be made available to our leadership team for further review and will be used to refine and update our practices. We want our customer journey to be the best in the industry and we thank you for giving us the opportunity to drive change. Mr. Searles, please know that although we must decline your request we value your loyalty as one of our AAdvantage¬Æ member since 2015. We hope that we have the opportunity to welcome you aboard an American flight soon. Take care. Sincerely,Lee ColeCustomer RelationsAmerican AirlinesAA Ref#1-30251236556"
463,"Avoid this airline at all costs.  The airline credit you will receive if they ever cancel your flight will cost you twice as much to use.  Not only that, when you eventually do manage to jump through all the hoops to schedule a new flight, they cancel it on you / reschedule your flight and don't offer a refund for the ""airline credit"" nor the extra out of pocket you had to use to buy a new ticket.  Further, customer service will keep pushing you off to other people, till you eventually realize that this airline is only in it for the money and not to actually  get you from point A to B with a smile on your face.  Do yourself a favor and use another airline, it'll save you a world of stress, you'll get a better flight, and you don't have have to invest endless hours trying to rebook a flight the AIRLINE cancelled on YOU"
464,"Horrible customer service. My in laws' layover was changed from being a 2 hour layover to being a 12 hour layover without their knowledge. No lodging or alternative flight was offered. When I called to discuss options, they only said they could refund and cancel the flight. They needed to get home, how is that even an option?!"
465,"I called American Airlines today and had the worst interaction I‚Äôve ever had with a customer service representative. She was rude, impatient and insensitive. She clearly hates her job and hates their passengers even more. AA has always had awful service. But this took things to another level. A reminder to try and avoid flying American at all costs. They‚Äôre awful."
466,Delayed. Not a nice experience.
467,"Never have had a good experience with this airline. If I have the option I will always fly delta. This last trip topped it with multiple couple house delays that ended in landing at my destination at 2 am with no taxis or transportation available at the airport. The worst part about American Airlines by far, are the flight attendants. They don‚Äôt ‚Äúattend‚Äù to anything except chirping at people to pull their mask over their nose. People don‚Äôt pay thousands of dollars to fly just to be treated poorly the entire flight by someone who is literally paid to do the opposite. AA flight 1414 from Indianapolis to Phoenix had easily the worst flight attendants I have ever experienced. Lazy, not helpful, rude and dismissive of individuals who needed additional help or explanation."
468,"Tonight was just an abysmal display of incompetance, poor planning and worse customer service.  Thank goodness some really talented Frank Sinatra impersonator busted out in song while we were waiting 2 hours for enough staff to arrive for the flight.  Had it not been for him I think there would be a lot more reviews written like this one.  Everything about tonight was mishandled and I can't wait to fly anyone else but American in the future."
469,"When you fly with AmericanAirlines, you feel like dirt. When you fly with the German provider, you feel like royalty."
470,"Arrived late to our connecting city due to ATC delay. Had to take the skylink to get to our terminal and then ran to the gate only to find out we weren‚Äôt getting on the plane and told boarding has ended.. meanwhile two non rev passengers were allowed to board. Only one flight a day that goes to our final destination so we had to get on another plane later and spend the night in a hotel. Told we should call AA to file for a refund- we got home a day later, had to make accommodations and pay for a stay in the airport. Talking to the rep they said no you need to speak to the gate agent.. given the old run around. For a company as big as AA it wouldn‚Äôt put even a dent in their billions in profits to reimburse us for our stay and partial refund for our flight as it was not our fault in the slightest.."
471,"Lousy service, lousy product, waste of money and never again... are the headlines that describe my experience with American Airlines. The firts call product is a joke, the after sales service not existing and I think, they rather have you transfer money to them an not provide anything in return.The lavatory on my flight was so filthy, that I almost vomited. The food served was one single catastrophe, topped by a sandwich, which clearly has outlived its shelf life by a few days. The flight hostess was so busy with her phone, that she almost missed the safety instructions. My brandnew Rimowa suitcase was totaled and can only be thrown away. The reimbursement process ($85 would be the max for my $1200 suitcase) is on purpose made so complicated, that probably everybody shys away from it. Plus the ""damaged baggage handling people"" could not care less or be even bothered by your complaint. Given the lousy quality of work and work ethic they provide, they should not make any money not even minimum. This airline is neither decent, nor does anyone of them have any honor or manners. A company is only as good as their head and I think what I experienced speaks volumes about their management."
472,"My wife and I were FALSELY accused of a CRIME of threatening a family aboard an airline during travel as well as embarrassed by their rude representative with his heavy-handed interactions with us both in front of all the passengers within earshot and I demanded to customer service to know WHO is responsible for those false accusations levied against us. The couple behind us had an unruly child who while on his fathers lap behind me kicked the back of my seat for a half hour and the father did NOTHING. When i finally unbuckled and turned around to complain the father told me to ""shut up and turn around"" which I begrudgingly did, so as to not escalate the situation. Upon landing in New Orleans we were escorted off the airplane by an American Airlines rep who was extremely rude. Then sheriffs deputys escorted us into the terminal and read us our Miranda rights. Only then was I informed I was accused of 'threatening a family on board'! First of all my wife said nor did ANYTHING yet was read her Miranda rights along with myself? Based upon hearsay from the parents or worse yet, another passenger with limited knowledge of the occurrence? What...guilty by association?? The flight attendant had ample opportunity to ask what the issue was yet instead reported to the Captain falsehoods that impunge MY character as well as my wife's! We are upstanding members of the community with ZERO criminal records and this stinks to high heaven. I am seeking an attorney to pursue legal action against this crappy unethical company!"
473,American Airlines is the worst I was a traveler with them until right now I‚Äôm on a flight and both the first and this flight are the worst ever I concealing all ties to them never again I‚Äôll fly with them!!!!!!!! The worst airline I‚Äôve been on for my life!!!!! Not even one drink was allowed everyone was rude and compared to the air line I was on going to my destination was 110 times better than this air line. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
474,"I have never written a good or bad review about anything but I guess there is a first time for everything. First. I used partial rewards from Capital One to book an American Airline flight. COVID happens... They happily cancel my flight and give me a credit. Fast forward to today. I booked a domestic flight and paid extra to select my seat in order to sit next to my gf. I was able to select the seat leaving but the return flight was disabled. Called AA and she was willing to change my seat that I have not selected yet for $50. I said no thanks. Why would anyone pay 50 dollars when they can ask kindly if someone is willing to change seats? Then I go back to Capital One and realize the rest of credit of $460 is gone due to AA's policy. I ask why the policy is in place but she was unable to answer the question. Worst airline I've dealt with ever. I am not one to complain about shortcomings but this is a new experience. You lost a customer for life. I will make sure whenever the topic of flights come up, it is my most sincere obligation to convince others they should never fly AA again."
475,"Every single time that I‚Äôve flown with this crappy airline, there‚Äôs a delay or cancellation without notice. Every single time, there is a delay. This most recent trip, they lost my luggage, and it was delayed twice and left! Also, the small planes always need maintenance, like they‚Äôre old, dated and and raggedy. I‚Äôm NEVERRRRR flying with them again. Southwest has never had these issues ever. If Southwest or Delta isn‚Äôt flying there, I‚Äôm not going. Hire new ppl losers!"
476,"Disgusting , authoritarian nut jobs. I‚Äôm sickened after viewing the bullying that poor mother of the two year old experienced after her child had an asthma attack. Shame , shame , shame ."
477,"This company is by far the worst kicking a 2yr old asthmatic child off there plane. Yes, he had a negative test as well! Despicable you should be ashamed!!!"
478,"The web site is horrible and as a result of needing a person, the customer support experience on phone is as terrible.  Makes you reconsider trusting your life in the air to a company that can't handle the technology to put up a competent website and ticket sales portal..."
479,Absolutely ridiculous! The way you are treating your passengers like we are not even human is disgraceful! A two year old can‚Äôt keep their mask on and you turn the plane around? Yet everyone else can eat and drink with no mask on? Was that two year old REALLY a threat to public health while the rest of the passengers eating were not? Get off your power trip and start being more compassionate to your customers! That is if you have any left. I will never fly with you again.
480,"Awful, simply awful. I had to cancel flight due to Covid last year and then rebooked wi ty a remaining balance. I was issued travel certificates in the mail instead of an electronic certificate as United and Southwest does. Using the vouchers is an absolute joke. I order to book you have to call. It takes forever to get someone in the line and when you do they make it very frustrating. You have to mail back in those vouchers, and note your reservation and flights number, everything in detail, in order to process the reservation. You have to give enough time for them to receive your vouchers or the trip will cancel. Literally. So if it gets lost in the mail, then what???? I can‚Äôt go on my trip? The last time I mailed in my vouchers it took over a month for them to accept and process it. This company intentionally makes it difficult to use travel credits if you have a residual amount from an existing credit. I will never fly American again, ever! I have no reason to fly with the other options available. They just don‚Äôt care abt the customer experience."
481,"wowi went on a plane and it LITTERALYY. crashed, what were the pilots doing?? HOW ARE YOU SO BAD AT FLYING YOU CRASH INTO THE Flipping AIR, i hope they get fired (they died though)thanks! greg"
482,"We were supposed to fly Cancun-Dallas-Reno on 07/31/2021 but got stuck in Dallas because the flight to Reno was cancelled. We received a text message when our plane landed in Dallas saying they can rebook us for 08/03/21 on a flight to Reno, which we of course didn‚Äôt accept. We went to an AA counter in Dallas and when we heard we couldn‚Äôt get to Reno that night, we decided on a flight to Las Vegas to drive to Reno from there. That flight got cancelled too. After an hour on the phone because the lines at the airport to get service from AA were incredibly long, we were booked on a flight to San Francisco that ended up being 30min delayed. We were assured multiple times that our hotel and rental car to reach our destination would be covered. We landed in SF at 12.36am and then found out our bags didn‚Äôt make it after being assured multiple times by AA they‚Äôd follow us automatically. We filed a claim at the airport for the bags to be forwarded to our house in South Lake Tahoe. After a night in a hotel in SF we took a rental car home to then find out our bags were sent to SF that morning. No notification about it to us though. We didn‚Äôt hear anything till 08/03/21 even though we were told we‚Äôd receive them within 24h after filing the claim at the airport. We finally received our bags on 08/04/21 at 12.42am. We are now sitting on the cost of the hotel in SF and the rental car even though we were told it would be covered but there was no way to book it through them and it‚Äôs impossible to get anyone on the phone to see where we can file a claim to get reimbursement for those costs. I filed a claim with BBB but AA says we accepted SFO as our final destination when we changed our flight, so they won‚Äôt reimburse us, even though if we hadn‚Äôt booked to SFO instead we would‚Äôve been in a hotel for 3 nights since they wanted to change our flight to August 3rd. We are a family of five (kids ages 3y, 8y and 10y) who were put through hours of running around at the Dallas airport while on the phone trying to figure out how to get home, to then end up 3.5h driving away from us in a hotel we didn‚Äôt reach till 2am and then having to drive home without all our belongings and then wait another 72h to finally receive them. We didn‚Äôt receive any refund for the hotel, rental car and extra food we had to purchase because we were stuck at an airport for hours. Shame on American Airlines."
483,Today had my flight to Denver from here Los Angeles ca at 4pm and at the last minute they changed it at 8:15 pm because they don't have a pilot to fly if they are not prepared Give people the opportunity to fly by another airline I think that's ridiculous I don't think I'll buy it again at American Airlines I don't recommend it to anyone
484,I will not be flying American again. Agents and stewards were rude. Agents were unorganized and frustrated. bad experince
485,"I booked a flight on American Airlines from Jackson Hole to Washington Dulles.  They changed the flight times without notifying me or my travel companion.  My travel companion was able to get a refund for the flight, but I was denied a refund (I got flight credit).  I don't understand why there was a difference in treatment for the exact same flight."
486,"I am at my end of my tether with AA. I had 2 flights booked back in 2020, which we had to move to 2021 which was fine, we understood exactly why. The flights were originally paid for using Paypal - great, made life quick and easy... or so i thought! When moving our flights to 2021, we discovered that they were slightly cheaper and AA sent us 2 vouchers - again great and thank you. We had our fingers crossed that we would be able to fly in July this year but sadly USA was closed to the UK, we asked if we could just have a voucher to saving having refund us as we wanted to book the flights for 2022 instead but were told they needed to be refunded - again not a problem if that made it easier AA's end. The refund request was sent in and both tickets were refunded on the system, we were told that it would take 4/6 weeks for the funds to be sent to us- again great, we were in no rush as the July 2022 flights wouldn't be released till July 2021. Now here comes the issue, we still to this date have not received the finds, i can only ever speak to the the reservations desk in the UK. I have been told by them that the payment has been sent to card number XXXX - small problem I have never owned a card ending with those numbers nor did i make the paypal order at the beginning with  a card ending in those numbers. Im asked to raise a refund contact form on the AA website, i have now raised 5 forms and still not one response back from AA. Another call with reservations today as i dont know what to do next, again advised to send a refund contact form which i have done again... this form has probably fallen into a black hole somewhere behind a AA plane in the sky... who knows. I just feel very disappointed with the lack of response from AA, i have been patient and completely understood with the current situation with the world pandemic but i feel waiting 4 months and still no funds to rebook or response its not great. This is making us look at other airlines to book our flights for 2022 as i feel let down with the lack of communication."
487,I had to go yesterday to Canada Toronto and those  The worst rcustomer service they they trying to make me late online and they don‚Äôt help me with anything and they told me all you can come tomorrow your flight is tomorrow and do another Covid test and I went there today and I showed him my Covid test and they said all this is not the right one they just those people just stole your money with me I wouldn‚Äôt give them no*0*those are raper steal our moneyPlease guys never booked American Airlines is the worst one And they never refund your money or give you credit
488,My family booked tickets to AZ six months before the Covid hit and we were unable to go due to the pandemic. I was told we could use the tickets credit at anytime. My son is now in Afganastan and will not be back for 9 months and the credit expir. Now they say is non-trasferable and he is the only one that can use the credit. I will never fly with American Airlines again. Beware they are crooks and only want your money.
489,"I fly American Airlines a lot, as there‚Äôs mostly no other alternative. There are constant delays with flights, sometimes for more than 2 hours. The staff is rude nearly all the time and does not help, when their help is needed. The only good thing that I can point out is the quality of the planes themselves. They are always modern and clean. But apart from that it has to be one of the worst airlines in business."
490,"STAY AWAY!!!! Pay more money with another airline, it‚Äôs NOT worth it! I had $1900 out-of-pocket expenses American is refusing to reimburse me for.   I have been a customer of American Airlines (AA) for many years; I hold a Premium AAdvantage Card (with over 110K points) and I also hold an Admiral's Club Card as well.  On 8/14/21 I was on vacation with my family (wife and two children) returning home.  It started off with the flight from Savannah to Charlotte. We were supposed to depart at 12:43pm, with a connecting flight to Boston at 3:02pm. The flight kept getting delayed (and terminals moved) and we did not take off until almost 2:45pm (Already missing connecting flight). On top of that, the aircraft had a poorly working ground Air Conditioner (87 degrees outside; did not work well in the air as well). We were then diverted to Willington NC due to a ‚Äòpop-up‚Äô storm. We sat on the tarmac for over 2 HOURS with no ground A/C. Finally, they moved us to a terminal; where we sat for another 3hrs.  We then attempted to get a secondary flight home (since we missed our connecting flight) and we were given the ‚ÄúOPTION‚Äù of flying back to Boston 2 ¬Ω days later, which would be the ‚Äòearliest flight‚Äô for four people. To make it home on-time for work, we booked with another airline (4 tickets). We finally took-off and got back to Charlotte at 10pm. American Airlines gave us no information when we landed, nor was there anyone to give us direction after landing so late. We rented a hotel room and paid for an uber to/from the hotel. (We also had to pay for additional day of parking and a day of kennel for my dog after finally making home).  This mistake of American Airlines cost me in total $1,900.00 because of the original delay of flight (weather was fine up until our LATE landing point).  I filed paperwork online with AA Customer Relations. I was THEN contacted by AA customer relations (after two weeks after putting in a ‚Äòcomplaint‚Äô and request for reimbursement) and they informed me that ‚ÄúOnly the hotel would be reimbursed; we do not cover other ‚Äòout-of-pocket‚Äô expenses, since they offered me a flight home 2 ¬Ω days later‚Ä¶SERIOUSLY???  I went as far as speaking to a Supervisor at AA who also reiterated the same information. Their new logo should be ‚ÄúAMERICAN AIRLINES, SOONER OR LATER WE‚ÄôLL GET YOU SOMEWHERE...‚Äù"
491,The worst airline in business. There is a problem every single time I fly with them. Their staff is rude and I‚Äôve had it with them. I‚Äôll never fly with them again.
492,We booked flights to Kauai Hawaii 9 months ago to prevent any problems !! Now our flight has been cancelled and our First class sitting is gone no reason it just happens!!! No help no service they state they can't bump anyone ?? as that isn't fair?? But that is what they did to us!!! This trip is a very special trip for our grand daughters graduation and our birthdays!!!! No help no answers nothing
493,"First flight since COVID.  First connecting flight, a flight attendant repeatedly told a 3-5 year old, while his parents were sleeping, to pick up his mask off the floor and put it on (child abuse).  Second connecting flight, captain started off with legal threats and ended with them.  5-8 sentences in all from the captain, and at least 3 of them were legal threats.  (Hey kid: in the event you have someone onboard who is on edge, these legal threats won‚Äôt help and are more likely to escalate the matter into an incident that none of us want to experience).  On the flight with the threatening captain, none of the attendants wore gloves, and one of them serving drinks gloveless seemed to be hoarse, hopefully not with COVID.When you try to email them online, you get first directed to their faq screen, then if you click that you still have a question, you get directed to a page with only an option to select things that lead to the same old faq page.  It goes in circles.  The only way to get an actual screen to send them a message is if you select the box that says you want to contact them about a gender change.  What happened to equal treatment?  Screwed up priorities!"
494,The website is awful. Hard to navigate. I wanted to add TSA pre check# and it was impossible to find instructions.
495,Upgraded to business class!  Took my money and forced me to sit in general seating.   9 hours worth of flights with severe sprinting in between flights and a .75 oz bag of corn nuts in 9 hours!  There was a woman literally slapping my head rest for 5 hours at which point a flight attendant gets upset with me because I expected manners.
496,"At one time AA provided decent service and we always chose to fly with them. They are truly horriblenow. One delay after another. First excuse, maintenance, 2nd excuse, waiting on a crew, 3rd excuse, the plane needs to cool down, been at the airport almost 8 hours and still waiting. Their folks at the counter are rude and don‚Äôt seem to have any answers. All you get is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù the Captain just said‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt fly AA until they realize, it‚Äôs the customers that keep them in business and not the other way around like they‚Äôre doing the customers a favor."
497,"American Airlines has HORRIBLE customer service.  I was flying home to Denver from Philadelphia, and at first there was an unavoidable weather delay.  No big deal.  The problems arose once they COULD NOT FIND the scheduled flight attendant.  With a three hour delay, you would think there would be plenty of time to ""find"" someone or locate an adequate replacement.  Our flight was delayed until 6am the following day.  It is what it is, HOWEVER...  they provided ZERO compensation of any sort to their customers.  I understand not granting hotel rooms for residents of Philadelphia and the surrounding area.  However, the only people they did grant hotel rooms for were people who connected through Philadelphia.  What about the people who LIVE IN DENVER!?  The airline is basically saying, ""we screwed up, so now you have to not sleep OR pay $200 extra dollars for a nearby hotel"" when they are the ones that screwed up.  At the VERY MINIMUM, offering breakfast meal vouchers could have maybe taken a little salt out of the wound, but once again, ""we're only giving meal vouchers to those who connected through Philadephia.""  What kind of customer service is this!?I then had to proceed to rebook to an evening flight the next day because I had too many Monday morning work meetings that I couldn't miss.  When I was changed to the new flight, I got bumped from having an economy extra seat to just an economy preferred.  From the onset of check-in, I was set to have an economy extra seat, and so far as I was able to see, there were plenty economy extra seats still available when I looked a couple hours prior to my reassigned flight.  What gives American??  It's abundantly clear the company doesn't want any customers.  On top of the inconvenience of being delayed for over 10 hours, the airline has cost me over $200 in extra fees for pet care due to the extra day and a half being away from home.  It's utterly ridiculous that they care not to make any sort of token or gesture of appreciation and understanding for their customers.  I've been on airlines where there were much shorter delays and the airlines gave all passengers meal vouchers, or seat upgrades, etc. - doing everything they possibly can to make a poor situation as right as it could be.  I feel bad for the employees of this airline.  No wonder their flight attendant was a no show.  I'm assuming their treatment of employees isn't much better than their horrid treatment of customers.  Stop being greedy American Airlines and get your act together!"
498,This air line is ridiculous my first flight delayed cause they had to fuel while we was on the plane that should have done before we boarded my second flight delayed and plus they moved the gate. I will never travel this airline again. Rude customer service no help at all
499,Had a very bad experience on my flight from Bogota to Miami after air stewards tried to force me to put on my mask beween eating pretzels. Absolute manics. Don't know whether all the mask rubbish (which has no scientific backing) comes from the top but it ruins the flight for everyone.
500,I wish there was an option for zero stars. Next time I'll pay the extra dollars to flight with Delta. How can you mess up the schedule of a flight attendant. We had to wait one hour and 45 minutes for the flight attendant to make it from her previous flight. They went from 9 am (original time) to 10 am  and then 10:45 am. They just kept changing and giving excuses about the flight attendant. Poor flight attendant.
501,"Envoy Air is a worst and too many no-brainers!!  At the XNA, the mgmt are not there most of the time.  Only time you see them is when they came in late night to spy on their hard working team members.  They don't even smile and say at least HELLO or GOOD MORNING to their staff.  When they are in the office, they sit there and eat lots of junk food.  What in the world would Envoy hired such??!!  Come on Headquarter folks and HR, you can do better than that.  This is why you're are losing people every day.  Put yourself together and train your trainers, LOL!!!"
502,"American Airlines is an awful airline. Their processes need to be updated. Why do I have to request manual refunds for a flight I booked outside of a 2 day period. Additionally, for situations booked inside of that window and I cancelled, if it is an automated system to approve/deny, why does it take 7 days to process? They really are all about their bottom line and do not care about their customers and their experiences. Also, the customer service reps are really rude."
503,"Awful! Just awful.I only booked a flight with them because of an offer that popped up promising a $200 credit if I applied for a credit card with their partner CitIbank ( even more AWFUL). I signed up for the card, got approved but they will not give me the promised credit and make no effort to resolve the issue. NOT GOOD ENOUGH.I cancelled my card and will never use CITIBANK OR AMERICAN AIRLINES AGAIN! IT HAS TO BE A 2 WAY STREET, YOU HAVE TO TREAT CUSTOMERS WELL & FOLLOW THROUGH OR NO BUSINESS FOR YOU.I will stay with Chase & United Airlines whom I've used consistently for over 15 years ~ much better customer service and flights."
504,"This is worst airline I have ever used. They take no responsibility for their actions and give no answers to their customers. It has been more than 10 days that my bag has been lost and they do not even answer my calls. This was my first trip to America and I came to chicago, I had a layover about 12 hours and took my bags to the recheck center but when I got to state college and one of my bags was missing. I am an international student and all my stuff was in that baggage, some of my jewelries in that baggage handed down through my family and I got depressed after this event. You cannot even imagine how irresponsible all the staff, managers and head courters are. They have no respect to their customers and I am really mad at them and I will absolutely never flight with this airline forever. I will surely sue them.I hate American Airlines."
505,"On August 17,2021 we were to return home from Tucson, AZ.  (We flew Delta to get down there and that was excellent).  We arrived at the airport to check in and were told there were delays due to weather in DFW. The ticket agent bumped us up to the earlier flight because it had not left and we had a tight connection in DFW.  We got up to the gate and moments after we got there the flight listed as cancelled.  Then shortly after that we were informed out connecting flight to Des Moines was also cancelled.  They rebooked us on a flight through ORD the next morning saying there was nothing else that day.  We looked at schedules and decided to see if we drove to Phoenix if we could get on a flight there.  Those flights were full according to the agent at the desk, AND she told us also our morning flight to Chicago was also cancelled and that the earliest they could get us on a flight was in TWO DAYS!  No offer of refund, no offer of any help of any kind.  We ended up renting a car at great expense, (and got the last one available due to the large number of stranded people) and drove 20 plus hours and also had the cost of the motel room and fuel for the car in order to get home.  I wonder if we'd still be there looking for a flight if we hadn't done the marathon driving.  We will NEVER fly American Airlines ever again."
506,"Flight attendants were rude, unfriendly and inconsiderate to passengers. They showed no patience or service to passengers who wanted to switch seats. It felt like we were being served by Walmart employees, not flight attendants. I view this airline as a last resort for domestic or international travel. I make an effort to avoid flying with AA. But when I have to, I‚Äôm always disappointed."
507,"Writing a review is a waste of time. NO ONE in management at American Airlines cares about anything. I think I hold the new record for flight cancellations. Dallas /Forth Worth, 6 booking in 24 hours, when I arrived at the gate, the flights were cancelled 6 times, Had spend the night on the floor in the airport, This was simple connecting flight from DFW to Tulsa, OK.  No one to talk to Customer service, on hold for an hour, hung up.  learned that on 8/17/21 American Airlines Cancelled 146 flights, Delta airlines at the same airport cancelled no flights. Finally by my own was able to book a flight and got to Tulsa the next day, Spent $104  for a Tulsa hotel I did not even get to stay in. No one at American Airlines to talk with. Endless phone trees and hours of wait times. This is a management issue. Think about this:  If they can't even set up a system to talk to their own customers, Just think about the maintenance (or lack of) of the aircraft.  I cannot think of any other company having worse customer service."
508,"Just cancel our weekend trip to San Francisco to see 95 year old great grandma one last time. We were travelling from Stl to San Fransisco, for some reason we had a connecting flight all the way in Charlotte with a 42 min layover. When leaving Stl takeoff was delayed 20 min because they forced a bunch of passengers to check their carry on to make more room in the overhead bins. On arrival at Charlotte another plane was mistakenly stuck in our gate and delayed us from unloading by 20 mins. So that left us with 2 minutes to walk 3/4 of a mile in 2 minutes to make it to our gate. We ran the 3/4 of a mile with my 4 year old daughter and 65 year old mother in law in tote. We arrived just in time to see our plane pull onto the runway. We then went to flight assistance, There was close to a hundred people in line that all missed thier flights. During the hour and a half we stood in line, at least 200 if not more people were seen sprinting through the airport. When we finally reached the counter the lady was rude and didn't have any flights until the next afternoon. We opted to just wait two hours and just return home. The American refused to give us any sort of refund. They wanted us to stay in Charlotte and fly to San Francisco the next afternoon arriving late the next day. Clearly this made no sense as this was a Friday depart Sunday return weekend. We would literally sleep in San Francisco one night, have a few hours to visit in the morning and rush off to the airport  on Sunday afternoon. On top of all this when we returned to Stl, our plane couldn't pull into a gate, they claimed that other planes had been redirected from another airport due to weather. We ended up waiting over an hour sitting on the tarmac. Low a behold when we exited the plane, the airport was empty, a ghost town, no one at any of the gates, the baggage return, no one waiting for cabs, busses, no anything. No arrival traffic a complete and total deserted airport. Something stinks. After all that a ruined weekend, stress on the whole family, and the most epic failure I have ever personally experienced, I just expect a refund for services that were not rendered. I mean if someone hired me to paint thier house, and I took the paint that they purchased and painted their driveway. Do you think they should pay me? Yeah, no."
509,"On 8/17/21, I booked round trip flights for my girlfriend and myself to LA with American Airlines. After booking the flight, I booked our hotel in LA, car rental, I bought us tickets to the Dodgers game, and made the necessary accommodations costing about $2,000 additional for the trip. Yesterday, 8/19, I looked to see the exact time that our flight was to leave, only to see the reservation no longer existed. I didn‚Äôt even receive a message from American Airlines confirming this. I called customer service & was told that THEY had made a mistake on the reservation and I got the flight for a price I shouldn‚Äôt have. I was told I can book the same flight for an additional $300 from what I initially paid. I told the customer service supervisor that I had already booked additional reservations & sunk additional money into this trip & she essentially told me ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your problem.‚Äù So, even though it was American Airlines mistake, I was still out money & forced to spend an additional $300 (that I booked with Delta) from the ticket price I was given. I never leave reviews on anything, but this whole experience was garbage. I‚Äôve never booked a flight, then had my reservation for the flight 2 days later canceled. I didn‚Äôt even know that was possible. Typically, if a flight is overbooked they‚Äôll offer flight credit. I wasn‚Äôt offered anything. I was just told my transaction would be refunded. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because they at least gave me my initial cost back (or said they would, not confirmed yet) Safe to say, I‚Äôll pay the extra $30 to fly with a competitor in the future."
510,This is not only the CRAP customer service. It's the whole company. It's the worst air company ever. CEO is an IDIOT because he does not give a damn to read thousands of complaints. What really matters to him is the profit. A perfect dumbass.
511,Cancelled my flight - no reason given.  Just a minimalist email.  I tried contact them to find out why and discover what options I had.  They direct me to read FAQs - none of which deal with my circumstances.  They ask me to use web chat - I try and it tells me all their agents are busy and try later.  I try ringing - long waits for the telephone to be answered and then cut-off twice for no reason I can understand.  What an amazing way to treat a customer !
512,The destroyed my suitcase and put clear packaging tape half way around it without closing it. They do not resolve your issue when you call instead they put you on hold for 2 hours at a time! I was on hold for 8 hours with them and not one person helped me!!! They do not care unless you are paying them then they help you!
513,"If you have a transit or multiple destination, do NOT use AA.com directly. It's the worst system and they say everything is okay if you call and it is NOT. The booked flight was wrong date (extra leg on wrong date), not able to check in online, e-ticket of the two segments not linked...while they tell you everything looked fine on their end! I have called them 5 times to figure out a simple booking (1 stop) and it's created so much headache that I won't make this mistake again."
514,"I have been on the receiving end of less than good service from American Airlines in the past and have let them know, so it is only just that I single out the service of Terry Helton, Flt 2044 Bermuda to Charlotte on July 29th, 2021. I was travelling with family members and my 19 month old grandson and Terry could not have been more helpful and genuinely engaged in ensuring our every need was met.Excellent performance!"
515,"If I could give American less than 1 star I would.  Not sure what happened to this company but they are not what they used to be.  Constant delays, canceled flights, no return calls or if they manage to call back after 8+ hours they hang up.  Need to contact them to change a flight but no one answers! Excuse of weather issues does not make sense when the rest of the airlines at the same airport are not having issues.  This last experience was the last straw.  After them canceling several flights - I could not take a chance and rebook with them so went with Delta.  Wow!  Night and day.  They actually seem to care about their customers."
516,We are flying and unaccompanied minor.  we paid the 161.25 for this at the time we purchased our ticket.  When I got to the airport I was charged the 161.25 again before he could board.  Since I didn't have the receipt with me I had no choice but to pay it twice.  If you are having to fly and unaccompanied minor be sure to take all receipts with you to the airport apparently they do not get everything logged into the computers.  I have been on the phone for 38 minuets now trying to talk to someone about this to try and get my monies back.
517,"I had heard that It is now common for AA to combine flights and it just happened to my wife and I. While I understand the cost savings, it is very frustrating. They tell you you cannot change your flight without additional fees but they can change whenever they feel it is best for them. On another note, it now takes 3 times the miles to fly roundtrip to Europe as it did before COVID. Now is the time to get rid of my AA credit card and get one that has decent benefits."
518,"Now I work hard for my money right,  I treated daughter to premium economy LHR to PHL.  Only to find that economy pac we‚Äôre checking in at premium/business check in.  What‚Äôs that about?  They didn‚Äôt pay so shouldn‚Äôt get.  I paid snd had to wait.  It‚Äôs a joke.  Disappointed."
519,"Classic too big to fail mentality. This company just clearly doesn't care about their customers. Would give lower than a 1 rating if I could. My flight was delayed. I've traveled almost monthly, usually more than monthly for about 30 years with extensive business travel. So I've had a lot of flights cancelled or delayed. In general I'm pretty tolerant and understand, after all, things happen. But American Airlines is so complacent and their customer service is so poor that when it does happen its the absolutely worst experience. I was bounced around for more than 18 hrs of cancelations and delays and then told I had to take a 3 connector flight to a different end destination if I wanted to get close to where I wanted to go. This wasn't a big snow storm or crazy grounding of planes, this was overlooking and just not caring. And then I found out they even prioritized other airlines travelers over their own. Absolute worst airline ever. I will be going back to United. They may not be perfect but in my experience between the two Id pick United any day."
520,This Airline was absolutely the worst they used to be such a great Airline there's no TVs to keep you busy you go up to the counter and Salt Lake City all the sudden somebody spelled my name wrong it took forever then I go to Dallas-Fort Worth Texas they were even worse the guy didn't even look at you look up with you he was extremely rude will never fly this Airline again JetBlue here I come
521,"Flight 1296 departure from Indy to Dallas was delayed due to a circuit breaker.. the part is in route from Chicago O'Hara. 5 hours later and $100 spent on parking, lunch and loss of work still no update.  In today's world its amazing that there is no on field service department with parts at an airport with all the same aircrafts. POOR Mgt. And communication! The gals at the desk were as helpful as they could be without information."
522,"August 8th at 3:30pm at gate C7, there was a very nasty man working at the gate. He was disrespectful to a family, my friends, elders and myself as well. It‚Äôs honestly cruel and sad that he did not care one bit about any of the costumers ESPECIALLY a young lady who needed to be on that plane. He was no help, rude, and continuously talked over me. I hope he‚Äôs banned."
523,Appallingly rude AA airport agent at LHR. Very aggressive. Not helpful and downright rude. NOT the sort of service you receive from US-based AA employee. The airline seriously needs to look into the abysmal difference in how their likely outsourced employees are operating. United Airlines is way better!
524,"We already experienced cancelations, seats that were not working in business class, and even problems getting wheelchair service on our trips AA canceled the flight 954 EZE/JFK for 8/16/2021 without any notification We found out about this via media I received a call today, finally, They did not have the chance to relocate this flight since they simply do not have flights EZE/JFK planned and they sold me the ticket as a nonexisting travel date They offered to refund me and it was accepted The refund is not a refund but a ticket credit that is useless since I have made the decision to do not to use AA in the future AA is holding my money in an illegal way I want my money back since credit is useless"
525,"i'm usually a very patient person.  I really tried to work with the agents and provide them all the information they need. most of my difficult experience is with AA and not the agents.Traveling from DC to Greece.  Initially, everything was fine.  book flights with seat selection and free 1st check bag.  6 flights total.  then AA changed my reservation.  first flight was at 8 am but was changed to 5 am.  I called to switch to a later flight....i tried for 2 days!  i used the automatic call back scheduling.  I was called but when i pressed 1 on my keypad when asked by the system, it says ""Sorry, your response is invalid""....what???after 1-2 hour wait time, I finally got through to an agent.  she was very helpful.  i got my first flight changed as i wanted....then i noticed....my return flight from Greece to Philadelphia was dropped!  it just disappeared entirely....nowhere to be found.....another 1-2 hour wait time, then i got through to another agent, who was also very helpful.  he said the Greece to Phila flight was canceled and that's why....what??? i don't care if it's canceled....you can't just drop flights without providing a new one....what?...we made the necessary changes...my flight from Greece to DC is established ...i was happy again....at this point, my seats for departure fights are picked which is good.  so now, let's pick seats for return flights since it just got changed....i noticed the return flight is now managed by British Airways.....at this point, i'm so upset! why? because now i have to work with another airline, which i didn't book with, and for sure, i know something is gonna go wrong....of course i was right...when trying to pick seats, i had to pay extras...for what i already paid for!....and so here we are....at this point, i really hope i can get a refund for the return flights so i can book Delta instead.....i'm really tired and wasted a lot of time on this.Summary:- AA needs to invest in better technology to help with staff- don't drop flights without providing a new one- Don't book complicated flights like international with AA- 2 stars are for the helpful staff.Updated:got my refund...never again."
526,"Damages luggage but don‚Äôt take responsibility, instead they just stop communicating. Don‚Äôt fly."
527,"Flying out of SJU with my carry on travel bag I‚Äôve been using since I started traveling for work a few years ago without a problem. At the gate waiting and they announce complimentary storage of bags to final destination. I decide I don‚Äôt want to do this because I‚Äôve been working all week and am exhausted. My flight gets in around 1a CT; I don‚Äôt want to wait at baggage claim. An attendant comes around looking at everyone‚Äôs bags. She approaches me and says I need to check my bag due to size. WTH. I explain I‚Äôve traveled with this bag for a couple of years and never had any problems. (It fits in the bins and is regulation dimensions) She goes on to tell me that the flight is full so they need to check some bags and they are checking mine. It‚Äôs gone now and as I look around, there are so many people with multiple bags. Really?  BACK TO DELTA I GO."
528,"THEE ABSOLUTE WORST AIRLINE EVER.  THERE IS ALWAYS A DELAY, AMERICAN AIRLINES IS PURE REPRESENTATION OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND IT'S STANDARD'S... LACKLUSTER!!!!!"
529,"ITS LIKE GROUDHOG DAY AT AA:  Delayed flight 3 x, changed planes (mechanical) then sat on tarmac over 3 hours begging for water--crew ignored. 5 our trip turned into 23 hour trip. Lied about weather issues in arrival city where daughter was going--she can prove it. Its always ""mechanical"" or ""we are bringing a new plane from the hanger"" (yeah, they are nasty dirty!), or ""weather issues""--cancel...want to give us vouchers--no way am I putting my life at risk. Bring water, food, change of clothing, and enough for your family to camp out for at least 1-2 days in airport."
530,"COVID has shined a light on how poor of quality this company is.  3-4 hour wait times on phone calls, changing a flight via a partner is a travesty.  Technology is so-subpar that it's a wonder that this company is larger than a kid who started a website in high school."
531,"We had a flight from LAX to Tel Aviv with a stop in JFK30 minutes in the flight to JFK they realized a door was broken and we had to fly back to LAX. This resulted in us missing our connection to Tel Aviv. The flight was rebooked for 24 hours later. We were not upgraded, compensated, and it took 3 hours (not a typo) to get a hotel at 3am. We had to pay for another covid test out of our pockets. And a full day in New York we did not plan for. This is while my wife is pregnant and we have another baby with grandma at home we haven't seen in a week.No vouchers either. F&ck you AA. Will never fly with your awful company ever again"
532,"canceled flight 2 days in a row , and still no explanation they moved you from gate to gate and finally cancel your flight FAA need to do something about this ,seem like they don't care  there's no repercusion they get away with everything sad very bad service"
533,"I've had 6 flights in the last month, EVERY one has been delayed. Two flights making me miss my connection.  I am appreciative that my safety is their top priority and I made no complaints about it and even tried to help the company out by putting my family into one room when they were running out of hotel vouchers due to so many customers missed connections. Until I had an issue and tried to bring it to customer service...long wait time, generic emails about company policy, little attention to the issue at hand.  Sorry to see such a great company move on a downward spiral."
534,"American Airlines can't and nor will they even try too provide care for their customers. Again getting a run around from this poor performing organization who daily show they do not care about us. Even as a member of their rewards club and Platinum Elite Card holder, they just take your money, throw you around wherever they want, pick and choose who is grounded even when they make the schedule, and then make monetary offers then don't follow through? Not to mention the Relations department taking over 2 weeks to not resolve an issue that should have been resolved in 24 hours. This is just an embarrassing operation at this point. I don't know if we should use tax money to bail out companies like this that would never left a finger to help any of us? Time for me to have our company take a look at the other airlines out there that may actually want our business and at least act like we are valued. By the way a Bryan Artz was the last person who failed to elevate my issue as requested twice via phone or email, so they can't even do that correctly."
535,"It should be no stars, our flight was canceled for no reason . They lost our bag , and they couldn‚Äôt give us back . We have our flight tomorrow in the afternoon , and they only gave us 12 dollars for our breakfast, lunch and dinner (we are 4)  . Even though they gave us the hotel for the night , they were not able to give us the flight the same day and have all the bags . Never pay for this airline."
536,"The business is a poorly run sh!t show. I have been stuck in DFW for three days now. They set me up with a flight only to change gates several times then as boarding time gets near, they delay a crap load of times only to cancel flight ruining any chance of rescheduling. Then they send u to their ""customer service"" which only has a least +200 angry people waiting in it. I could of drove this several times now but now I'm stuck with no chance of a refund."
537,"Traveling from SFO to ORD on 8/1 and just as boarding was about to begin, there was a delay. About 10 minutes after boarding was to begin, they announce they are short one flight attendant but they are working on it.  After another 20 minutes or so, without a verbal announcement, the monitors show the flight is cancelled. AA service from that point turns awful. The gate agents tell everyone to go to customer service counters, where their were no agents, the‚Äùpriority line‚Äù had only two agents that where doing their best, but could not keep up. Their service was crap. I can share a pic where at one point, the only agent working the ‚Äúpriority‚Äù line walked away for 10 minutes. The employees there said they are understaffed and have asked for more help but they aren‚Äôt getting it. Also, after finally rebooking us (a family of 4) on a flight the next day (a non-direct via DFW), I get a notice they cancelled that flight! It was back to the drawing board. This time, the poor agent even said ‚Äúthis company is going to drive me to drink!‚Äù Who ever the station manager is of SFO they are not doing a good job with staffing or the moral of the staff. American claims to be a major airline but they feels like some cheap budget carrier."
538,Most pathetic customer service I have ever dealt with. Was put on a on-hold call back wait list. American Airlines called me back 2 hours later and then made me stay on hold for over 30 minutes again. Absolutely horrendous customer service experience.
539,"American Airlines is terrible. They are always delayed, the planes are awful, the customer service people are very unfriendly. The people  act like you are taking money out of their paycheck, And they NEVER EVER tell you what‚Äôs going on. Just NEVER FLY American Airlines"
540,First time flying American Airlines -tickets were a gift to my son to meet up for a reunion of marines from 1990-he had 4 flights to catch first flight was delayed so he missed his second flight -caused him to miss his ride to the reunion-had to spend money on a hotel and fly into another city where someone could pick him up---flight home first flight was delayed causing him to catch another late flight delayed witch caused him to miss the next flight--worse flying experience ever!!!!!! Out of 4 flights all were delayed causing him to spend more money and time and missing his time he was expecting to spend with an old friend-and WE had bought the flight insurance -have nothing Good to say about American Airlines
541,Always my flight choice if I have the option. They always provide top notch service. Thanks AA.
542,Just don't do it.  Fly on another airline.  It took 3 days to get home from Orlando (to Des Moines).  No hotel/meal/transportation vouchers or reimbursements.  They bumped us out of First Class with only a $150.00 reimbursement (we paid $900 for each ticket).  Rude employees.  4 hour hold times to try and speak to a Customer Service Rep.  It was a complete nightmare.  We're Amex Black Card holders and we've notified our Centurion Team that they are forbidden from booking any further travel on American Airlines for us or our employees.
543,We booked first class as it was our wedding  anniversary.  On our flight back we were delayed over an hr due to no air in plane.   We take off and one hr later are told we are coming back to Dallas as there is a problem on the plane.   We get to Dallas and sat at airport with no direction for over 3 hrs.  Not even as much as a glass of water.  We bought first class as sacrifice and it was a horrible experience.  Finally we boarded at approx 9:30 pm and got home after midnight. We asked repeatedly for info and they kept telling us they had no ideas and no crews.  It was a horrible experience and will never fly this airline again.  0 stars
544,"As a seasoned traveler, I never book travel by speaking to a person. But American Airlines requires customers to speak to a representative to book an unaccompanied minor ticket. After over 10 hours of signing up for a call back, their program not working, missing calls, I finally was able to speak with a human who set up the ticket. She asked if I wanted to upgrade for ticket changes and I responded that I would pay the fee if we needed to change the ticket. No objection from representative. Fast forward to needing to change the ticket... she had sold me a ticket that could not be changed or modified for any reason. AA is not my preferred carrier so the idea that this type of ticket would even exist in the world, never crossed my mind. It's not like it was Easy Jet prices.... After asking around, most people do not know AA offers this restrictive of a ticket. I hope the word gets out and others can avoid wasting $500. This policy is so offensive as an unapologetic scheme to steal money from customers that I will never be able to bring myself to purchase an AA ticket again."
545,Staff has an attitude of bad office workers. Always late.
546,"I would give them no stars.Been delayed a million times,not to include the snack they give you is a joke and not to mention we sat on the landing area for over an hour waiting on other planes to leave.You would think yall would have a better system put together.Also on top of it we were charged $30 a piece for our bag one way and another $30 coming back Never again will we fly American Airlines.Worst airline ever."
547,"Probably the worst flying experience I have ever had in 33 years of flying. If I could give American negative stars I would. The night before our departure flight from VPS at 11:30pm they delayed our 9:30 flight (the next morning) an hour and a half. Forcing us to change our first flight as we would no long make the connecting flight and we‚Äôre told, you will not make this connection. We had first class tickets, and the new and only other flight no longer had availability and we‚Äôre told ‚Äúoh well, it‚Äôs this or delay a day or two.‚Äù Then on the return flight 8 days later though DFW they started gate changes at 9 am. And once arrived in DFW our flight was delayed 5-times No updates beyond, ‚Äúwe should know something in 10 minutes,‚Äù gate attendants disappeared and stopped notifying passengers of status updates. Travelers were required to rely on their phones to tell them their flight was, once again, delayed."
548,"So, I know many people talk about how rude the customer care is. In my case it was case of a rude customer care assistant who was talking over this very nice young girl who had all the intention of assisting me and my family in getting on the airplane. We are leaving from Dayton to Finland and after looking at the travel requirements and covid-19 restrictions found all the necessary documents. We also looked at the American Airline's website in order to make sure we had all of our ducks in a row. We then contacted customer care at AA who confirmed we had all the required paperwork. Come today and we go to get our boarding passes and this young nice girl who did not know the rules exactly, asked for help. The help arrived in the form of a very rude assistant who took one look at us and asked if we had a covid-19 test and when we told her no. She refused to talk to us. Despite us telling her that vaccinated passengers are exempt from having a covid-19 test, despite showing her documentation from the Finnish Government, American Government and American Airline's website information. She told us that she does not care what information we have and that we would not get on the plane! She then questioned my status and my wife's status as the parents of our two boys by claiming that we do not have supporting information to prove that they are our children, even though we have passports and this is not our first trip with multiple stamps in the passports. She took a look at the passports and said ""I do not see anywhere on the passport that states that you are the parents of these children"".  She then refused to talk to us and made it very hard to communicate.It is only thanks to the nice young girl who took it upon herself and called someone at AA and got the same information as what we were presenting and allowed us to get on the airplane.I know that rules are rules, but those rules change and at times like this it is imperative that the employees representing AA should keep up with the new rules and regulations, and most importantly be willing to listen to what passengers tell them. We are after all not fools and have done our homework, which you would expect if you spent 5000 dollars on plane tickets. So, I ask American Airlines at Dayton, Ohio to please PLEASE talk to their employees and educate them on the new rules and regulations and allow for a smooth travel experience."
549,Bad experience is the normal with American.  Many staff are always rude.   With covid they extended our vouchers because our plan got canceled due to engine issues and we didn‚Äôt make our flight.  Now we tried to extend them again and they refused to do so for us but are doing it for others.  So now we will lose $500 worth of flights because of their terrible customer service.
550,"First class is the best. Love the service, nothing changed during pandemic"
551,Never had a problem with this airline. Thank you soo much.
552,"Doug Parker needs to resign as CEO of American Airlines. There is no customer service and I have never seen anything worse than when I traveled from DFW to LAX to OGG. From a black lady harassing white passengers and this being tolerated to the employees at LAX being ""Clueless in Cleveland"" on the procedures a traveler needs to comply with to enter Hawaii and providing different answers to the OGG employees not opening the ""self serve"" kiosks and creating a line for priority passengers and main out to the street. An ounce of common sense would say allow the customers to complete their portion of the check in themselves. NOBODY SHOULD FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES! RUN!"
553,"My wife and I wanted to surprise friends for a birthday party In Mexico City, we did research and found that American Airlines had a flight that left at 6:30 July 17th, when we were driving to DFW we were notified that the flight was delayed till 7:40 then after anohter hr, it was delayed again when we asked why? They said the tires were flat, then 40min later the breaks were bad! OMG!!!  Our friends party was from 8pm to 12pm the flight was 3hrs plus customs then travel time we would never make it in time! We spoke to a very kind gentlman at the Boarding gate and explained our dilemma to which he stated oh, you guys are okay you will get a refund without any issues, BOY!!!! were we surprised! After looking up our rights it seems we have none and that anyting the airline does is a courtesy in our behalf! Although the if the flight is 3hrs late then you can get a credit! We later found out that because we cancelled at 8:40 it was not 3hrs, enough to allow us discourse!!! We later found out that Flight took off at 12pm 6hrs later that schedule but because we decided to leave after 2hrs 45min we were did not meet the 3hrs, horrible guys dont let them do this to you. I am gonna sue in small claims court cost me another $150 filing fee and see what happens but I just want to see myself, maybe the Judge has used American and has been dupped!!!"
554,Worst customer service from American Airlines employee and supervisor.Traveled on 7/16/21 from O‚Äôhare to Charlotte gate H11BPaula at the ticket counter decided to change my seats the ones we picked and paid for because she was talking out of her butt and I didn‚Äôt hear her what she was saying. When I said I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt hear what you said  she said it‚Äôs ok . They will change our seats anyway. So I pay for the flight and I pay for the seats and the employee and supervisor who said they don‚Äôt have to repeat questions twice are allowed to change my seats. I replied back I can‚Äôt wait to let everyone know about this and the supervisor King closed the door and said we are not allowed to go in the plain because I threaten them. That was a treat for him. Please have them go back and get some more training. They really need it.Worst customer service. American Airlines employee like Paula and supervisor so name King need more training in dealing with customer service. I work in health care. Question was about the seats by the emergency exits. Only if I could hear that sleeping beauty at the ticket counter. I probably have more medical training than Paula ticket counter and supervisor King. I will never use American Airlines again. I‚Äôll rather pay extra.They should be thankful for ppl like us who travel. That‚Äôs why they still have jobs.
555,"Due to a lack of American Airlines employees checking in customers at the ticketing/checked baggage desk located within the Salt Lake City International Airport as well as poor customer service, we were not able to make our 8:00 am flight. After multiple delays at SLC and DFW, we finally arrive in LBB to discover our bags were incorrectly offloaded at DFW and waiting in the baggage claim area. You would think it would be an easy fix to have my bag flown from DFW to LBB on one of the 5 nonstop flights which occur throughout the day. However, after notifying both DFW and American Airlines multiple times throughout the day, my bag has continued to sit at the baggage service desk at DFW after nearly 36 hours. Despite going without crucial pain medication for going on 2 days, the customer service representatives have been unwilling and/or unable to accomplish the simple task of transferring my bag on a flight to LBB. I‚Äôm so desperate at this point were it not for my one-year-old daughter, I would have them book me a round trip ticket to pick up the bag myself as it is seems this major airline is incapable of the simple task of sending me my ‚Äúalready found‚Äù bag."
556,I have flown AA for 40 years. I would give AA four stars until this summer. This summer they get a single star. They get to the airport with an on time flight and then delay and change gates for hours and hours. Then cancel the flight and you are forced to miss work or vacation by returning to the airport another day. AA how do expect to stay in business by not actually flying? This gas been going on all summer long.
557,"I was so DISAPPOINTED with American Airline‚Äôs. First and last , I will NEVER fly with this airline ever again. My family (of 5) was denied baggage check-in to board our fight back home from Hawaii. We arrived 43 min to the airport before our fight was to take off. I explained to the agent that we had to wait for the car rental place to open before we could return the vehicle and then we had to wait for the shuttle to bring us. Agent did not care, they told me that their policy‚Äôs is we cannot check-in your bags 45 min before the flight. I explained to the agent that I was not trained nor do I work for the airline‚Äôs to know their policy‚Äôs. Agent did not seem to care! They said, all that can be done is get you and your family on another flight. I explained to her, I have two special need children and it would be difficult to wait at the airport for a long period of time. Agent said, sorry nothing I can do. Agent did not really care for my situation. I say that because, they did not even try everything they could to board us on our flight. For 45min the agent was booking us to get on another flight. They wasted all that time for which they could of tried to board us on our original flight. They could not find an alternative flight for my family of five to board a flight, they tried to even get us on a next day flight. I said there is no way. The best they gave us was 10 hours to the next flight. It is very sad that no one really cares, unless it effect them directly. It was very hard to keep two special needs occupied for that long period of time. I lost all trust in these airline! Crazy as it may sound or would you believe me; before flying out to Hawaii, we waited at the gate for 30min for all things linens and before we flew back home from Hawaii. They waited 30min for crew members to arrive before boarding the flight. I completely understand things happen and you can not help when things out of your control happen. But my situation flying back home was in-full and under there control to board us, they just choose not help me and my family. I Will never understand why people will treat other‚Äôs like you are less then nothing, also to treat you wrong unless it does not directly effect that person and for many to only do something when it can benefit them. I can only say that I am only a little guy compared to thousands they service around the world. So the mind set is, there is always someone else to service. A mentality like that really shows the corporation‚Äôs sympathy/empathy stance, towards people‚Äôs life. I been trying to reach out to American Airlines for a portion of my refund. For which, I paid extra to avoid these problems and all attempts to contact then failed, they been avoiding my mail and emails. I even try reaching out to costumer service. They just email me stating that they are very sorry to hear and they will bring up to corporate. Nothing on my refund to my request. I am not asking for all of it back, I am only asking for the fee I paid extra for their priority seating. Regard"
558,"My current experience  was with customer service. I havent even had my flight yet and already will never fly American again. Wouldnt have chosen this airline in the first place if I didnt have family on the same flight.Customer service my phone is horrible. They never call you back when they say they will. I was told one time that they would call me back in 6 hours. That is ridiculous to start with, but I didnt receive a call for 12 hours which was 2AM in the morning.  I guess I was supposed to sit up all night.  Now I am waiting for another call which I should have gotten already. I sure hope my flight will be better than my experience with customer service.  If not, then Im screwed."
559,Absolutely terrible experience flying AA this summer. They lost BOTH of my packages and refused to reimburse me. Just horrible airlines. Gosh.
560,This airline is the worst!! How can they still be allowed to sell tickets?
561,"I normally fly United, and pretty regularly, but I had to book a last minute flight due to a family matter and I saved a little bit of money by booking on American and taking flights that had layovers.  That was the WORST money I ever ""saved"".* Flight 1 - Houston to Dallas - due to ""equipment issues"" I was in the plane for nearly 2.5 hours instead of 40 minutes, with very little communication from the pilot as to what was going on.Flight 2 - Dallas to Newark - due to the delay in the first flight, I barely made my second flight.  Wanted to purchase a beer on that flight, but was told that I was told that there were no alcohol sales (or any sales for that matter) in the main cabin ""due to Covid"".  Does alcohol somehow spread Covid?Return Flight 1 - Newark to Miami - this flight got delayed so many times that eventually it was clear I was going to miss my connection back to Houston.  Was told the delays were due to ""weather"", but it didn't seem like other airlines were experiencing these delays.  Was re-booked on a later flight to Charlotte with a new layover to Houston for that night.  Return Flight 2 - Newark to Charlotte - waited a few more hours at the DISGUSTING and limited American Airlines terminal at Newark, only to have the IDENTICAL thing happen.  Delay after delay after delay (again, due to ""weather"") and I would therefore miss my transfer in Charlotte.  I had to scramble to book a hotel (out of my own pocket) and new flights for the next morning.Return Flight 3 - Newark to Dallas - was supposed to depart at 8:35 am, but did not depart until 12:00.  Again, allegedly due to ""weather"".  Due to the delay, I was again forced to change my return flight from Dallas to Houston.  Putting me back home even later in the day.  This flight eventually departed.Return Flight 4 - Dallas to Houston - delayed due to weather - this time I think legitimately - we took off a little late and were then re-routed around a storm which added an hour to the flight time.During all of this, it was IMPOSSIBLE to get anyone from customer service on the phone, and the WEBSITE WAS DOWN.  FOR HOURS ON END.  Ultimately, it took me over 24 hours to get from Newark to Houston, and cost me hundreds of dollars out of pocket.  Another thing I noticed was how much nicer, as a general rule, that flight attendants, gate attendants, etc. are at United, versus American.  There were one or two exceptions, but most of the staff I came into contact with at American were unfriendly, often rude, and seemed like they just didn't want to be there.  The one thing they seemed to enjoy was telling people to pull their masks back up, almost immediately after taking a sip or a bite of whatever they were eating or drinking.  No joke.I know for a fact that airlines often lie about the reasons behind delays, and I am confident that I was lied to so that American didn't have to reimburse me for being stuck 24 hours in Newark.  If I can avoid it, I will NEVER fly American again, and will stick to United, even if the flight happens to be more expensive."
562,"Just a terrible experience. I‚Äôm never the type to go on a website to write a bad review. However, American Airlines need to do a better job. I missed my flight and they couldn‚Äôt deliver my luggage in time. Awful customer service as well"
563,"Agreed! We got to the airport OKC 2 hours before our flight left, stood in line 5:30-past 7 to check bags, when we were in security they started boarding our flight, our group is 25 people, our family is 6 and they would not let us board the plan, the plane left 15 minutes later, Virus test time again $$$$$$ With the kids, baggage  on it‚Äôs way with the rest of the family! Would not put us on another flight, so now have to sleep in airport, until the am. They would not let us on our flight, plane still in doc, loading shoot still attached too. They would not put us on another airline Terrible and I‚Äôm without words really."
564,"I had purchase a flight from Las Vegas to miami and I paid 1800 dollars for two tickets the seating was selected on aa.com on next to each other , when I go flight they gave us completely different tickets separate seating and then wanted to charge us 71 dollars each for tickets in the same row with one person in the middle . How could this be possible .. never flighting with American airline again"
565,"I usually fly Southwest who‚Äôs top notch  customer service but had to use American Airlines because of my schedule. Their customer service is absolutely horrendous! I just waited an hour for a call and still no response via phone. Also, I booked a flight and received no email verification. Lastly, I did speak with someone last month about flight questions and the woman on the phone was totally miserable. I don‚Äôt know how this company stays in business. Never again!"
566,"Where do I begin. I planned a visit to my native country Guyana and was being accompanied by my husband. I tried to review the baggage requirement online  and it was very confusing. I tried calling customer service,  waited for over 45 minutes and  then was told that I can have a call back after 4 hours. The phone rang at about 11:30 and when I answered it was not a live person but a machine telling me someone will be there since my call was important. I hung up the phone when  no one came to to the line after about 20 minutes or so. We got to the airport 3 and a half hours before flight time. The line was long and painfully slow. I saw about 6 agents at the ticket counter but they were mostly chatting and sending people back to fill out forms which the customer apparently did not know they had to fill out . I even witnessed that one of the ticket agents was particularly  rude to a few customers and then will walk over to her colleagues to talk about the victim openly. It was disgraceful. I finally got to the counter to check in for myself and husband (who had gone to park the car in the airport‚Äôs long term parking) I was asked if I was traveling alone.I told her no and said where my husband was . She responded, ‚Äòthe other person has to be here, thanks‚Äô then she looked past me towards the line  and said ‚Äò next person‚Äô. I moved to the side of the line to wait for my husband who had to take the shuttle back. We waited for an opening and approached the counter again to check in. The agent looked through a booklet and then asked if we can step aside to fill out an online form which should have been sent to us when we booked the flight. The form took about 20 minutes to fill out . We approached the counter again ( third time for me and second for my husband). We handed over her passports and she said to my husband , you won‚Äôt be flying today. My husband asked, ‚Äò what do you mean by that‚Äô  and she said, ‚Äò your passport must have at least 6 months.‚Äô My husband said, ‚Äòmy passport is not expired and will not be even after I return from the ten days vacation.‚Äô My husband asked why was he not told this when he booked the flight and provided his passport information? She responded that anybody can book a flight it is your  responsibility to know the requirements of the country you are traveling to.  She told him again, ‚Äòyou are not getting on this flight today‚Äô  and quickly addressed me, ‚Äòma‚Äôam are you going to fly.‚Äô By this time I am wondering, does she really expect me to abandon my husband and check in. This was callous and bureaucratic. There was no apology. It was very humiliating and disappointing. To add insult to injury we spent the day trying to cancel and recover charges for hotel  and to find stand in for trips we planned when we got to the destination ( and were non refundable)"
567,"United airlines are not airlines anymore. They became a corporate, unhuman,  china type of business. They don't care about customer service at all. They charge for everything.   Move your business to China or North Korea. You belong there."
568,"I have never had such a terrible flying experience!!! I will never fly American again and discourage anyone from doing so.  From start to finish, it was a nightmare!  Literally, at every step there was in issue and I had 4 flights. CVG>DFW>ICT and the reverse on the way back traveling June 5 & June 27, 2021.1st- They did not offer a boarding pass on my phone. Never got an email, nothing, so had to go in the line at American ticket counter, which, was the ONLY airline with anyone in line, if that tells you anything.Next, they said they did not have a ticket for me. My daughter was flying with me, however we booked separately and on different credit cards, so no connection.  The attendant asked if I was traveling with my daughter and I said yes.  They had me connected to her somehow and said no ticket for me!  Ended up almost an hour to get it handled, somehow they found it and gave us boarding passes.Just made it to our gate! Return flight was an absolute disaster.  No gate assignment to start with, get to security and have wrong date for my daughter birthday on her ticket, so had to go back to the long lines of American ticket counter to get it resolved...another hour to do that (how did we get there in the 1st place is my question!)We get up to the gates and still no assignment at 6:20pm flight was for 6:36.. Delayed flight until 7:15 or so, which meant we would miss our connecting flight to CVG, which we did.  Initially we were told it was a mechanical issue by the flight attendant, and when we got to the counter we were told it was weather, how convenient, so would not pay for accommodations. No apologies, no vouchers, no nothing to make anyone happy.  They instructed us to go to the customer service counter for American. Now there is a line of hundreds of people.  It is near midnight until we get up to the counter, and no flights available until Tuesday.  She said we cold try stand by for a 7:30 am flight, so we found a seedy motel ( as everything was sold out.) to go to for a few hours, as didn't want to sleep in airport and nowhere to go there either...hotel cost me $140 with uber to it.  Luckily we got on the stand by flight and got home.  Needless to say, I will never, ever take another flight with American Airlines ever again, and will be sure to inform anyone I know not to!!!"
569,"They rescheduled my flights so that I am going to miss my brother's bachelor party, and booked me with a 12+ hour overnight layover to boot, making what should have been about 13 hours gate-to-gate into an over 24 hour ordeal. No apologies were made. No partial refunds or arrangements for accommodation during the 12 hour layover were offered. I called to ask for a rebooking or money for a hotel, and there is a 3 to 4 HOUR wait to speak to customer service. I was dropped already once after 2 hours of holding for no apparent reason. They offer a callback service, but it doesn't seem to work for a non-US phone number. I would deal with it via their website but it does not have this kind of functionality. So I am basically going to spend the next 4 hours on hold and hope to get through, and hope that they do something to rectify this.It honestly seems like they make getting a hold of them difficult on purpose so that people will give up without even being able to ask for help or a refund.""To speak to a representative, please continue to hold"" will be playing on a loop in my nightmares for weeks to come."
570,"My husband took the flight from Chicago to Albuquerque on 7/6/21.  Very helpful with kiosk,  flight was on time overall great flight."
571,"10 years ago they were a different airline, nothing amazing but better than expected for the price.  Now you literally can't fly with them. In 3 years,  4 AA flights,  4 issues. This last trip was from Nashville to Dallas was insanity. Got rerouted to Tulsa, spent 1.5 hours circling, 4 hours on the tarmac, got a water and bag of pretzels and was told the airport didn't have to do that and to thank them. About the only information we ever got. AA let us off the plane at 9:10 when all the stores closed at 9... I didnt want a handout,  but let me off the plane so I can feed myself but almost exactly 8 hours to get from Nashville to a gate in Tulsa.Get to Dallas about 3 hours later,  then 22.5 hours til new flight,  have to get a hotel and no luggage. AA didn't know where our luggage was but promises it will be at destination. GLAD THEY CHECKED MY CARRY ON THAT HAD MY MEDICATIONS, so beyond inconvenient. Glad I'm not on anything more life threatening. Desk told me I would have to wait until SD, go to the ER or he could call 911 for me.$500 unexpected later on a plane to SD.  landing and pull up and over water. circle, pass, circle... I live in SD I know we're doing weird stuff, I know the cities below us that keep coming and going.  3 circle and they finally announce we were too close to airline in front of us and had to get back in line. Over SD County til landing took 1h15m.  This doesn't happen with other airlines,  Spirit is the 2nd worst and ill still buy a ticket from them,  but never again AA.I hope bankruptcy comes quick and competitors pick up a major of their runs. USPS to postage is better than AA to air travel."
572,"If I could give 0 stars I would.  Sitting on the tarmac since 4 pm.    Initially they didn't announce that we were going to be delayed almost 2 hours.  I took my phone out of airplane mode and got a text from A saying flight was delayed until 6p.  Plane flight pattern changed, have to add fuel.  It is 6:35 pm as I am typing this.  After the fuel was added they needed to move bags around to even the plane out.  I guess there's no option to multitasking.  Then they announce we can now get off the plane if we choose, but must take everything with us.  They have not even offered water.  Babies crying.  People getting hangry.  Now, AFTER people have gotten off the plane, they announce that it will take longer than the 30 more minutes because people got off the plane.  I am traveling with a child.  Normally, I bring extra snacks, but they asked everyone in line after group 6 to check their bags.  I was in group 8.  Didn't pull the snacks out of the checked bag.  Lesson learned.  Keep your snacks close by and don't fly AA if at all humanly possible.  6:44p no offer of food, no water.  Still sitting."
573,"Terrible experience with this company, I bought in may tickets to Ecuador for family vacation . 2 weeks before trip they changed flight time absolutely inconvenient for me for both ways. My vacation was destroyed. I canceled the tickets and after 3 days spending on phone bc waiting time now is 3 hours I received money back and they took from me 180 dollars. So they are doing whatever they want without any punishment.  And now they are selling this tickets in 3 times expensive Terrible company, absolutely unprofessional stuff and rules"
574,"Had a trip planned for the 4th of July holiday. We were scheduled to fly American airlines out of Austin Bergstrom with a connection to Bozeman Montana out of Dallas.Our flight was scheduled to board at 5:55 AM on July 1st . We checked the TSA wait times via the TSA app and arrived at the airport 1 hour and 45 minutes hours early to ensure enough time to check bags and get thru the TSA security process.The line to check bags at American was out the door. No other airline had similarly long lines that morning. There were only four American employees working the check in counters. We were in line for almost 2 hours and ended up missing our flight. Once we got to the check in desk, we were told that the best they could do was put us on a 5:30PM flight to catch a connection in Dallas to our final destination. The only problem was that we would be on standby for the connecting flight and that the connecting flight was fully booked. Thanks so much American. Stranding us in Dallas did not seem to be a reasonable solution.I have two problems with American airlines after this less than pleasant experience.1.	At no time did an American employee appear to ask people in the check in line when their boarding times were.I travel frequently and when traveling with other airlines I have never missed a flight due to check in delays. Invariably all other airline companies I have ever dealt with always seem to have employee(s) working long check in lines making sure no one misses a flight. Apparently, this does not occur to anyone working at American.2.	After missing our flight we requested ticket refund. They denied the refund request and insisted on a creditBased on the inconvenience of missing the flight and the incompetence of how American handled the problem I think a refund would be reasonable. Americans recent proclivity to cancel flights seemingly on a whim combined with a total disregard for customers in my mind makes a future travel credit all but worthless.Epic fail American airlines. After reading some of these reviews it's clear that customer feedback is meaningless to you."
575,"I purchased three first class airline tickets to Puerto Rico to celebrate my daughters 16th birthday. Upon arrival back home while unpacking my luggage I notice that valuable items were missing from my baggage. The airlines enforce rules where you‚Äôre unable to carry on certain items due to the liquid measurement regulations, then when I comply and add my very expensive perfume to my baggage, it‚Äôs stolen right from my bag! I follow the exact directions from the airlines abs put in a claim to only be told ‚Äúsorry‚Äù they can‚Äôt do anything about my loss. I feel completely violated and can‚Äôt hold anyone accountable for what was illegally taken from me. I WILL NEVER FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES AGAIN!!"
576,My reservation just disappeared from the web. It is the 3rd time my travel is jerked around. I am now waiting 5 hours for somebody in this customer service and NOTHING!!!!
577,They put or bag on a different flight and have sent us to 3 different baggage claims to find it and every worker at the baggage claim is unbelievable rude and not helpful at all. If you don‚Äôt like your job then simply don‚Äôt work here.
578,"Impossible to reach customer service. Was on hold for customer service for 2.5 hrs, no answer. Left a message for a call back- I was supposed to receive a call after 4 hrs, it‚Äôs been 10 hrs now and no call back. My husband and I have our tickets on the same reservation. If I try to change my flight it automatically changes his BUT I only want to change my flight! All I need is for someone to break out the tickets onto 2 different reservations so I can go online and move my flight a week earlier. I can‚Äôt get ahold of anyone to do this. Insane that I‚Äôm chasing these people to try to give them more money and they won‚Äôt answer the phone and take it. Don‚Äôt book with them. It‚Äôs a nightmare. And being a frequent flier doesn‚Äôt matter. You‚Äôre treated just as poorly."
579,"They suck in a way that is hard to put in words. Avoid like the plague. First flight cancelled for lack of crew. Second flight, four hours later rerouted to Atlanta, three hours from destination. That flight was cancelled for maintenance issues. No other flights available. Tried to book us for a flight two days later automatically. More than an hour and a half wait time to get to customer service. Ruined our first holiday vacation in a year and a half. They do not have the crews or staff to meet their flight schedules and are proactively cancelling almost 100 flights every day because they don't have the crews. And, checked baggage was still sent to Atlanta despite the flight being cancelled. Never fly American Airlines -- let them fail and the other airlines take up the slack."
580,Less than one star is not possible. Waiting on the phone this morning for more than an hour as I write. No one is picking up the phone. Their website won't let me change my travel plans.American Airlines is a Shame of America.
581,"I had a very shocking experience todayI had a very shocking experience today. I have normally had good experience with AA, but today I experienced something terribly shocking. I am South American but I Live in the UK and for some reason called costumer service in the US, the lady over the phone was disgustingly rude. She had a nonchalant attitude and was treating me in a very condescending way, she even laughed at my accent  and made comments about not being able to understand me in a very very rude way. She sounded like she had answered the call from bed and I had somehow disturbed/interrupted her bedtime. What really got into me was the way she was treating me, and how nasty her comments about my accent were. I said to her that I should probably call another time as she was being disrespectful towards me and I wasn‚Äôt going to tolerate that. And her answer was: whatever!!!!"
582,"Just the facts here. Recent travel from Tyler Tx-->Dallas TX-->Las Vegas NVVia phone, on hold 7 hrs to change travel day. AA never answered. Tried twice.Had to book new flight; lost massive $Dallas Gate, terminal and departure changes 4-5 times. About 6 hr delay.Left stranded in wheelchair (Dallas), right in front of AA employees; no offers of help.I only got home  that night because a nice traveler/stranger pushed my wheelchair.On top of this, there was a large man yelling verbally abusive language, near C6, with no security workers to stop him."
583,"What an incredibly horrible experience AA has been. I called 24 hours prior to our flight to change to an earlier flight. After over an hour and a half on hold I was disconnected. Now my flight is delayed since you do not have any personnel to accommodate the flight. This company is a disgrace and I will be taking to social media to ensure everyone knows not to use this airline. When visiting customer service in concourse C I was told they have no idea what is happening and it is ""Above my Paygrade!!"""
584,"The first class seats on the Dfw to Fairbanks are no more than wider economy seats. Hard as rocks. The first class has no perks,  no screen for viewing movies. You have to use cell phone.  No charging ports for USB, must have brick,  so phone died.  Queen bee flight attendant was a B....., Food was non existent. We were fed a protein box. Cold salami, rock hard sourdough flat bread, small dish of fruit, humas,  and 1/2 cup of salad.  Kept waiting for sandwich we were told we would get.  Never got it.  The crew had got meals.  They smelled wonderful while they were heating up. We the paying customer get fed dog food.  American airlines is nothing but corporate greed. Charge me 1,800 for first class and treated us like economy. Never again."
585,"Staff were friendly and plane was comfortable BUT a 4 hour delay into Orlando because of the RAIN. Doesn‚Äôt it always rain in Orlando? Kept getting one excuse after another .... no food or water offered I felt that would have been the least they could have done given lots of children on board missing diner. Supposed to be off the plane by 4 pm it‚Äôs now  almost 8 pm and we are still sitting on the runway :(  SOS!update: on the way home our trip was cancelled due to ""weather"" one of the stewardess told us while we were in line waiting to be told our options that ""they didnt have a pilot to fly the plane"" might i add it wasnt even raining at the time they cancelled our plane - FOR TWO DAYS! told us to sleep in the airport didnt offer vouchers or food - also took our bags and said we would have to get in another line that was at least two more hours to get our bags (it was midnight by this time) we got a room close by(our expense) and my husband went early the next morning to get our luggage- he stood in line for 90 minutes without anyone able to find our bags.....had to get another room the next night in North Carolina . Then finally got on the plane 2 days later and the engine overheated at the gate so they turned off the plane - was 90 + degrees babies, elderly (had my first panick attack) whole experience made me NEVER want to fly anywhere again...sorry AA i dont normally write bad reviews but this was a horrible experience."
586,"Even pre pandemic they were horrible. Almost every time that I try to go visit my grandkids, from one smaller airport to another with a stop in Phoenix, a supposed 4 hour and 10 minute flight has been 10 or 12 hours.  They delayed then cancelled my flight today with a few hours notice and couldn't get me to Phoenix in time for my connecting flight so they wanted me to fly tomorrow and get there at 9:30pm.  Then I told the phone rep that they were supposed to get me a flight on another airline and she said there was a flight but it had come back unconfirmed from the other airline, Delta.  My daughter got me on that flight from her end so now I'll be flying there tomorrow earlier on Delta on the flight the American rep couldn't confirm."
587,I have never experienced worse customer service anywhere. They say to call a specific number then make it impossible to get you on the phone with a representative. American airlines is the biggest joke I've ever heard. I hope you go out of business.
588,"I'll try to never buy a AA ticket again. Virtually no customer service. They are changing the schedules as if it is a joke. Over 3 hours of waiting just to have a grumpy lady saying ""just email us, we will let you know"", the website shows flight, trying to modify(I paid the extra to have that option) pops up a warning flight ""can't be found"". Waste of time and money. Save yourself a headache. I wish Delta has hub in Arkansas."
589,"What an absolute joke. I‚Äôve tried calling this company multiple times after 50 minute waits, And you have to listen to their ungodly ringtone that is so repetitive and annoying, can you guys please just not play any music at all while we are suffering for nearly an hour? Then after waiting, each time I was told I would get a call back and my place in line would not be taken. When did I get a call back? 7 AM the next day, which I missed cause, guess what? The phone doesn‚Äôt even ring when they call! It just goes straight to a missed call; and the second time I got a call back at 3 AM the next day! And it gets better, when I was able to answer at 3 AM, I was then placed on hold for 12 minutes, this time I had enough and just hung up, It makes no sense, why are you calling me back and then having me wait again? Isn‚Äôt the purpose of calling me back so I don‚Äôt have to wait? Seriously for an airline as rich and popular as this you would think they would employ more people for their call center. And for god sake‚Äôs we‚Äôre in a pandemic for over a year now, it should be made WAY more clear on the website as to what Covid test (PCR vs antigen) is required to enter specific countries and regions, and the sales representatives should be made aware of this as well. I‚Äôm very disappointed with all the time I have wasted, especially when considering how much money I spent on my ticket"
590,Delayed flights seem to be the norm. My mother-in-law was supposed to leave at 1:20pm today (06/22/21) and is just now leaving at 2:42pm (6/22/21). If you book with American make sure you have a layover of a few hours so as not to miss your next flight.
591,"I have never had such a terrible experience with an airline. The morning we were to leave (4 hours before takeoff to be exact) AA rescheduled our flights for the following morning which would completely mess up our travel plans. After nearly 3 hours of waiting on hold with CS, we were adamant on getting put on to another airliner and they finally did so after insisting that we drive to another airport 2 hours away to try to get to our destination on that day due to THEIR cancellation. Not only did we get to our destination 12 hours later, but we lost a whole day of our vacation.Coming home was just as bad. Not only was the check in process complete chaos, but they were asking people to volunteer to change flights due to overbooking (as a means to make more $ off of people who don‚Äôt show up). We then had a 3 hour layover which then turned into 4 hours due to their delays. After 12 hours of traveling we finally get home to realize AA never put our luggage on the plane- our layover was FOUR hours. There‚Äôs no reason any luggage should get left behind after such a long layover. The worst part is that the airline really doesn‚Äôt seem to care about customer service/experience. They‚Äôre just trying to make up for lost time and only care about your money. Please, take your hard earned money elsewhere and do NOT fly with American. They will make your travel plans miserable and not show a single ounce of sympathy for it."
592,"Got a ticket Mexico city - AustinIn Mexico city my flight got cancelled. Had to wait 5 hours in line so they could rebook me. They did not even had the decency to offer us water.In total a delay of 9 hours.On the return flight I only had a delay of 2 hours. As they had a problem with their catering there was no food on board, neither water.And of course arriving in Mexico they lost my suitcase. Took them 2 days to bring it to them.Writing them a complaint is useless.They only write you stuff like: ""I would like to reaffirm our commitment to delivering a world class service and hope that you will accept my sincere apology for the inadequacies you have reported. Please travel with us again soon; it would be our privilege to serve you again soon and to provide you with the level of service you expect and certainly deserve.""Does AA mean American Alcoholics?Please, if I would ever be that crazy to fly with AA again so you can give me the level of service i deserve, give me the same drugs you are on..."
593,Get another airline to travel they are the worst. Customer service does not work
594,"It first started at the curbside check in. I waited 20 minutes for this one customer service rep helping a family family... I had been in line a long time and asked him is it going to take much longer, he seemed to not understand English and waved me off.. I say this because the family he was hoping he was speaking Spanish to.Anyway, I get out of the line and go to another and my bag is checked.. after we boarded the flight we sat on the plane for about 35 minutes or so before the captain came on to tell us there was an issue with the smoke detector and we were waiting for the maintenance people to arrive.They apparently arrived at some point as we sat on the plane that was getting hotter by the minute with no info. Finally, roughly 45 minutes later he came on and said that they're trying to fix it but they didn't understand what was going on.. The maintenance people don't have a clue. Great! After about 2 hrs they tell us that the plane is being taken out of service & we have to deplane... so now everyone has to get off,  take all of their luggage out of the overhead cabins and go sit and wait in the boarding area again..Mind you there are people on the flight whose final destination was not Los Angeles and they were going on to Portland and Hawaii.  American got on the intercom and told them they were completely sold out,  they didn't have any other flights to put them on and if they didn't get to LA on time most of them will be looking at spending the night in the airport...So now after waiting in the boarding area again they tell us that they repaired the problem and we're going to start the boarding process all over again.About an hour later we're all back on the plane but we sit there another 30 minutes before we're ever pushed back... The pilots weren't very informative... they let us sit there quite a while before they told us that the holdup was that we were number 8 in line to take off and there was some weather pattern that was delaying all of the takeoffs..Great!  4 1/2 hours later we finally get in the air and the trip itself is uneventful... except for the screaming baby... We were supposed to land at 1:05 but we landed at 5:15.Then the flight attendant gets on the intercom and tells us we're going to have to go into a satellite gate and take a bus..LOL It only made sense, the entire flight had been a comedy of errors.A few minutes later she gets on and says we're not going to the satellite location but we are going to pull up at the gate in the international terminal ..But before that, once again we're sitting on the aircraft wondering what's going on and the pilot gets on and tells us ladies and gentlemen the machine or whatever it is they used to bring the plane and attach it to the jetway is for the wrong type of aircraft & we have to wait for them to go get the right one..So finally they bring the rthen we had to get off the plane and walk all the way over to the domestic travel area to retrieve our luggage and the poor people trying to make connecting flights had a long way to get there because they weren't even in the domestic terminal...Finally, because of the plane being in the international travel terminal and the luggage coming through the domestic side,  we waited 30 minutes before they even started sending the luggage down... For the privilege of all of this, we got water a soda and a ginger cookie..I fly a lot and this was the absolute worst flight of my entire life."
595,"American Airlines no longer cares about customers!  Yesterday, I tried to contact the AA Reservations Department, but was told that the wait time was greater than four (4) hours and I would receive a call back.  Ten (10) hours later I received a call back (after 10pm) and was forced to listen to a message about COVID Travel Credits while I waited in queue for two additional hours until I finally hung up after 12 (midnight).  The next day (today) I attempted to contact customer service via Chat on the AA mobile App.  After going through the automated responses, I waited around an hour for an agent, but this agent did not actually answer my questions.  In fact, the Agent (Nikita) informed me to call into Customer Service for help and then disconnected the chat session before I could ask a clarifying question.  So, I am back to calling the Reservations toll free number and AGAIN I am being told that I will receive a call back in more than four (4) hours!!  This is a cycle of death and it is clear that American Airlines doesn't care about their customers.Here is the kicker - American Air wants to force people to use the on-line system...  So, let's talk about their on-line system.  The reason I need help is because I have a 'Flight Credit' from a trip that did not happen during 2020 due to COVID travel restrictions.  On AA.com it states in multiple places that ""You can apply the value of your unused flights toward a future trip"" and ""to apply your Flight Credit on the payment page.""  Well, that is not feasible!!  There is not an option on the Payment Page for applying flight credits, so the only way to get this done is for a (Phone) Representative to assist... This is where the cycle of death has it's grip on me.  I would like to make a reservation and apply my Flight Credit, but apparently this is not a viable option when making an on-line reservation, nor can the Representatives working the Chat queue assist. Sooo, in order to speak with someone on the phone it seems that you must be nocturnal and willing to discuss your travel plans in the middle of the night, which honestly I can not confirm is feasible, since I only heard a message about Flight Credits (over and over and over and over again) until my brain could not handle it any longer, so I disconnected the call.  Are there actual phone agents working at American Airlines?  That is to be determined!What a mess that @Doug Parker, @Maya Leibman and @Robert Isom have created!!  I will leave you with this... I have been an AAdvantage member since 1994.  I have tried to be a loyal AA traveler, but I have ventured out to other airlines over the past few years and I have learned that my experiences both in flight and not in flight are far more enjoyable with some other airlines.  NOTE: This was not always the case.  Also, I know some AA flight attendants and they are great people and do amazing jobs.  My issue is with American Airlines and their approach to how they handle their business and customers.  As a DFW resident, American is often the ""go to"" airline, but that was due to convenience for me. However, I think it is time to find other options where the airline company actually cares to help a customer and make them satisfied.UPDATE!!I received a response from American Airlines and it further proves that THEY DO NOT CARE about me as a customer!  Here is the response I received on 6/24/2021:""Thanks for writing to American Airlines. I would like to start by offering an apology for the delay in the response. Your correspondence remains of vital importance to us. Although we couldn't contact before, I'm glad my colleagues have assisted you with your new booking for your upcoming trip.Again, I apologize for the trouble while trying to connect with our Reservations team. We value your loyalty as an AAdvantage¬Æ member and appreciate your business and look forward to welcoming you aboard soon. Thank you for choosing American Airlines!""Umm, that doesn't come close to acknowledging the real issues I faced, nor does it say that they will work to fix those problems.  No, this response only apologizes for their lack of punctuality in responding and then recognizes that my persistence to speak with a Customer Service agent finally paid off.  Honestly, I think this may be my last trip on American Airlines!  Who's with me?"
596,"WORST AIRLINE I HAVE EVER FLOWN WITH!!! If I could give negative stars I would. On our trip to Belize for my wedding we had had numerous problems within our entire group of 25 people traveling at different times. Just for my family of 5 we have had planes switched on us due to engine troubles. so American Airlines thought it was a good idea to put my 9yr old son rows ahead of where anyone else in our group was sitting by himself. When I simply asked if they could move him anywhere closer to us all I got back from Anna at the Houston location was attitude and eye rolls and she didn‚Äòt see why sitting a 9yr old by himself was a big deal. Instead she was very rude and customer service went out the door. Little did we know at the time that American Airlines does not care about their guests and no one seems to like their job, no smiles, no empathy, nothing! Then after we got to Belize from San Antonio, we had a family of 5 leaving from Austin including a Granny 84 yrs old Almost miss their flight due to American Airlines not knowing their own policies and procedures and not being consistent across locations. Even though we were traveling on the same Airlines with the same policies during Covid. Austin would not let them leave until the bad the QR code (which does not exist anymore) for traveling. the lady was arguing with them saying they had to have that or they couldn‚Äôt fly. Keep in mind that 18 people already made it into Belize without the QR code since it is an OLD policy. so American Airlines will do whatever it takes to stop people from flying but will take their money. Finally after lots of arguing a supervisor said they could show a picture of their accommodations to them (why didn‚Äôt they ask for this as a solution before it escalated??!) so since it was for our wedding everything was in our name, that was another issue but I guess they were tired of arguing so they allowed that picture of accommodations . We had people traveling with us that paid more for specific seats that were just moved and had to eat that cost. BUT the WORST was in MIAMI. We were supposed to be home in San Antonio last night but due to American Airline delays leaving Belize we were already an hour delayed to our flight to Miami. Due to American Airlines decision to allow a DRUNK MAN to aboard their flight and right when we are ready to take off he THREW UP. So instead of making him get off the flight and ONLY delay himself American Airlines thought the best solution was to allow him to stay on while they cleaned 2  isles of THROW UP for AN HOUR while all passengers got to see and smell it so our flight to Miami was delayed another hour at this point. so when we finally made it to Miami our group of 9 people that we were traveling back with (not sure about anyone else that was on our flight) were made to go into a different line where we were told we can not make the flight back home. Even though our flight had not left yet. Surprisingly we made it in time and we‚Äôre thinking we could really make it (we could have if American Airlines hadn‚Äôt already made up their minds that they would re sell our seats and bump is from the flight) so instead they told us all 9 of us had to stay in Miami for 24 hrs for us to fly back on a 8pm flight next day. Again no apologies for their delays or decisions that puts us in this situation with 3 kids. They were rude and thought it was acceptable. So here we are family of 9 that could have made it home if it wasn‚Äôt for American Airlines delays and on top of that our flight leaves at 8pm but now the hotel in Miami that American Airlines accommodated is making us leave at 11am so we can wait at the airport for 8 HOURS. American Airlines didn‚Äôt even get us a late check out for THE MISTAKES THEY CREATED!!! Worst Airline EVER, we are not even home yet so I‚Äôm sure we will run into more issues. Do Not Fly American Airlines Please!!"
597,"Absolute  worse airline ever .We fly in with Divi Divi from Bonaire  ,we  had 1 hour + 20 minutes til our connecting flight to Miami by the time we arrived and made it to the AA counter .American Air had closed their counter over an hour+ early , so we could not check in our luggage or get our boarding passes !!! Had airport security to call to AA rep there at that  airport   ,  American Air representative did not want to come back to desk , instead told to security to have us call AA toll free number to schedule flight for next day . Off course our US phones  DO NOT call Curacao numbers , AA customer service call back dint call us back until 8:36 pm. And they charged us to change over our flights , and again did have to pay luggage that we had already paid with the first flight ? None of witch was refunded !!!"
598,"I would give a zero score if I could. Would not refund flights from Heathrow to Orlando, as the flights were still going.  (Basically flying empty) As UK citizens cannot enter the US for leisure purposes. All I got back was the tax. Absolutely fuming. Just a scam to keep customers money. Will never book again with AA."
599,Worst customer service. They lost my bag and when I try to get answers everyone I talk to is acting like I am an inconvenience to them. I will never fly with them every again after this experience and will never recommend them to anyone. I have spent hours and hours on hold waiting to speak to someone just to be hung up on because they don't care. Do not fly American.
600,"American airlines just asked their workers to volunteer their service to help out this billion dollar business with their summer service, even though they layed off thousands of their workers during the pandemic ,with no pay. Their CEO made over 7 million last year but they don't want to pay their workers. It's a travesty.  I'll no longer fly with them."
601,Always delayed which causes missed connections which causes lost luggage.  Happens all the time with AA. They just haven't figured out how to operate an airline yet. Try not to use them...especially for international travel.
602,"This is the worst flying experience of my life. Our flight at 10pm was cancelled reportedly due to weather in Dallas. We watched flight after flight take off following the cancellation of our flight. We were directed to go to customer service to receive assistance with getting on another flight to get home. We were told that the only flight available would be in two days. When asked about accommodations we were told that American isn‚Äôt a hotel and that we would need to figure it out. Unacceptable customer service. There was no attempt to empathize, no apology, and no attempt to help further. When asked about getting a hotel accommodation due to being scheduled out two days we were told by Elena that as parents if we wanted to make sure our son was properly taken care of we shouldn‚Äôt have traveled without enough money to get a hotel. When the supervisor arrived it was much of the same. Raised voices and yelling that there is nothing American can do. Stating multiple times that it‚Äôs not their fault the flight was cancelled and that we signed a contract. We asked to speak with the managers supervisor only to be told she‚Äôs not going to speak with us because she won‚Äôt tell us anything different. They threatened to call police on us. We attempted to get our bags (and toddler car seat) that we checked, in an attempt to drive the last 5 hours to Wichita only to be told that they would not release our bags. The highest ranking manager Jennifer reluctantly spoke with us and was no help as well telling us that there‚Äôs nothing we can do. Continued to tell me to call corporate if I wanted saying it would do no good. I called customer service and stayed on hold for 2 hours and 16 minutes before hanging up. After much debate and finding out there are no rentals available and full hotels we stayed the night in the airport. In the morning we found one of very few bright spots from a customer service rep named Bellen. She helped us find a flight into Kansas first thing in the morning. Unfortunately our bags got lost while we were in flight. Now in Kansas bagless, we worked with the great team in Manhattan to report the missing bags. Delivery was set up and now we wait with no safe form of transportation for us and our toddler. The incompetence of this airline is unbelievable. Only rated 1 because 0 is not an option."
603,"This review is about AA now, though the downhill began mainly since the merger with US Airways. AA was generally human until the merger but now is daily losing its humanity and is in an exponential decrease. I am speaking as a former ExPlat member and a current lifetime elite member. Being a part of AA elite is now just get what you can when you can as AA has even clammed up with treating elite well. Reminiscing, I even had decent CS experiences with AA before becoming elite (a looooonnnnggg time ago), but I hate to know what it's like now for a non-AA elite to get anything reasonable done. What caused the camel's back to break?...partly...several times (more than 3) tonight I've tried to reach an agent via their call-back system (I left my number for the system to call me instead of waiting), but the calls all got cut off. I'm to the point where if I can get a MUCH better deal with AA, then I fly AA, otherwise I look elsewhere. They are so automated that Parker probably needs to be informed if he's communicating with¬†a bot or a human. My attitude toward AA is quite opposite to what it was just about 4-5 years ago. I will use up my free stuff and then it's pretty much adios to AA. In all, I'm sorry for the time, money and effort I expended with AA and it's because they've become sorry in EVERY way!!!"
604,Today my flight was canceled two hours before and the last fight of the day was canceled as well. At this time I have been on hold for 6 hours. I was in queue for chat for over three and received a message that they closed for the day at 10:00 on Saturday. I am stranded and need to be someone where on tomorrow this is unacceptable.
605,Never choose American Airlines again.  Horrible.
606,"Amazing is the only word to describe AA. My daughter arrived 55 minutes pre flight and got in a line of about 30 people. It appeared as though AA was grossly understaffed as the line barely moved. She has used self service check in many times in the past but it wasn‚Äôt working that day. An explanation of this was never provided. Concerned that she might miss her flight she asked an AA Employee for help. She was told to ‚Äúget back in line as everyone here is in the same boat‚Äù. She finally got to the front of the line 30 minutes after her flight left and was told there were no other flights with anyone that day to her destination, that she was on her own and zero assistance of any kind was offered. There were flights with other carriers but AA simply didn‚Äôt want to help. My daughter was distraught and in tears. She was spotted by an Alaska employee who went far above and beyond to get her back on track despite the fact it was AA who screwed up. I called American Airlines customer service twice I‚Äôm gonna come back each time. One time it took for us 4 hours and 40 minutes to get a callback. The other time it took 2 hours and 30 minutes. Obviously American is bombarded with customer complaints or grossly understaffed. I also called Alaska twice and got callbacks within 15 minutes each time. I also filed a written complaint with them. The response was apologetic. They asked for another chance which to me would be similar to being kidnapped and tortured before being released then being contacted by the kidnappers at a later date and asked for a second chance. No air miles, credits or flights were offered. As bad as it was to miss the flight the situation was grossly exacerbated by the terrible attitudes of the AA employees. I am 61 years old and have had over three weeks to process the situation. I can‚Äôt come up with a worse customer service experience and am still amazed by how little they care about making things right. A 1 star rating is too high. As 1 is as low as you can go the rating is really 0-4. Of the 562 reviews on Trustpilot the average customer satisfaction is 15%."
607,We left an iPad on an American airline flight. It was reported with a few hours and they still have been unable to find even though our iPad locator states it‚Äôs at the airport!!! The airport was also contacted and responded in a timely manner advising it is not in their possession.  American has been contacted via email and chat. There is no way to speak to a pulse!!!  Horrible lost and found customer service!!!
608,In the 21st century you'll expect at least professional personal not to be racist.. but sadly American Airlines staff are Racist.
609,This was the worst trip ever I arrived at the airport at 4am for my flight it was supposed to leave at 5 am but was delayed to 7 and then 9 and then 9:45 am o missed my flight
610,"flew out of Tulsa on May 26, 2021.  flight delayed 50 minutes ""due to traffic in Dallas"".  destination was Memphis.  left memphis sunday, May 30 at 7:30 am.  Holiday weekend, everyone departing on sunday, only had 2 agents working to check people in!  we stood in line for 1 hour and 15 minutes (got there at 6:00 am) and had to run to catch our plane.  we were in the very back seats and had to stand up to let others in our isle, and got chewed out by stewardess telling us to quit blocking the isle and to sit down, ""had to depart on time""  we couldn't sit down until the people in the window seats sat down!  Very rude employees.  should board from seats in back to the front.  too chaotic the way they do it .  I can understand boarding first class and priority first, but after that, need to board from back to front"
611,"1 ster is nog teveel voor deze #### airline.1 star is actually overrated for this #### airline. Missed my flight due to long check in line in Austin. I had an international flight from Austin to Amsterdam, with a layover in Dallas.I stood in line for 3,5 hours to be checked in to Dallas !! Nobody cares about your flight , they just simply rase there arms if you ask for help . Mind you pregnant with  a toddler !! And huge huge line with only few employees , other airports would  have dealt with this line in a much shorter time but not American Airlines , I stood In line for hours !! Asked 5 different AA staff for help nobody cares .They put me on 2 flights after the one o was originally on !! That‚Äôs how long I was in line.that one was delayed, I will spare you the details of that flight !.By the time I got to Dallas , supposed agents would be at the gate helping passengers , not an agent to be seen.From there I was treated with no dignity what so ever , staff is rude impolite and instead of helping that actually make it more difficult for the passenger.Rebooked for next day and the rest I could figure out for myself and pay out of pocket , over 400 dollar extra cost, Treated with  disrespect and left to figure all out for yourself . Even after talking with the supervisor , they refused help and talk to you like your garbage to them .American airline if you want to treat your customers like low cost airline passengers then don‚Äôt charge us for high class airlines .I will leave a r√™view on every site possible so I can warn as many people as possible about this ##### airline . This is the most horrible horrible expierence  i ever had to deal with , and my 1,5 old daughter had to deal with as well"
612,"May 28th we were supposed to fly out of DFW for a 30 minute flight home around 9:25. They kept delaying up until almost midnight and then they cancelled our flight and pushed us to the morning. They said it was because the bathroom on the plane wasn‚Äôt working. Again this was a 30 min flight. They gave us vouchers for cabs, hotel, and food. When we went to get a cab we were told it could take up to an hour. Then they put us in a hotel an 20 mins away.. mind you it was almost 1 am when we arrived to the hotel. We were traveling with my 9 year old. Then the hotel refused to accept our voucher from AA. They really didn‚Äôt explain this to us they just said we could talk to the manager in the morning. We went ahead and stayed and provided a credit card assuming this would all get straightened out. We did talk to the hotel the next morning and we‚Äôre told that they have told American Airlines many times that they do not have a contract with them and did not want them booking rooms for customers because they don‚Äôt accept the vouchers. The manager said they did this to 11 customers just that night we wereThere. We only got 2 1/2 hours of sleep before we had to head back to the airport. The cab driver was upset because he said he hates taking vouchers from American Airlines because they don‚Äôt pay the full wage and they take forever to pay them. After we finally got home and rested I contacted American Airlines to see about getting a refund for the hotel. I was told they don‚Äôt do refunds, instead they gave us vouchers. We don‚Äôt want to fly American Airlines anymore so now we‚Äôre out $200 for a 3 hour stay at a basic hotel..... thanks American Airlines..... next time we will just sleep in the airport because you treat your customers like dirt. We weren‚Äôt the only ones either. Also some of the passengers said when they got to their hotels they didn‚Äôt even have rooms available... they don‚Äôt care about their customers at all."
613,This airline Only cares about money! Soon after realizing we were not going to make our flight we contacted them and they wanted double the ticket price we had paid to change us to a flight later in the day. Never even offered us an opportunity to fly stand by..our only option was to pay an additional  $850. You would think during these unprecedented times airlines would be willing to work with you but that‚Äôs not the case with this airline. After many robotic replies from customer service I give up on them!
614,"Well we just changed from using Delta because of delay s . I was hoping American was going to be better. Once again I have been disappointed by the lack of service ( at this point I have been on hold for over 2 hours trying to talk to someone at American). I realize that they could really careless about the plane being late , the pilot lying about the reason why its late or the fact that this has once again cost us a hotel and other expenses the most important thing is my wife gets to come home once a month and now they have taken a day out of that . I am not ranting like I see some of the reviews but rather I am thinking the next time the ecomony goes south and the airlines need to be bailed out I am asking myself why ?Let's say a few of them go out of business  do to poor customer service , poor time management, lack luster employee that could careless of the needs of their customers. Let's give the one that are doing a good job stay in business because they deserve to not because of the party they contribute to . When they know that the Government has the ability to bail them out whenever they need it , why change the level of service they provide. When they are the only game in town they can sit fat and happy behind the desk and screw the customer they have to come to us right?? I say we start by changing the people who are supporting the airlines .Let's provide them and the people who love to give them MY tax dollars the same level of service. Lynn Oliver"
615,"I  booked a round trip from Daytona Beach FL0 to Boston MA with connection in Charlotte NCI requested wheel chair service becausemy wife had 2 foot surgeries and is non weight bearing on her foot.Both times we arrived in Charlotte and they had no one available to push my wife from terminal E to B and visa versa return flight.After waiting 20 minutes and the gate agent apologizing I had to push the wheelchair.I am a disabled veteran with a heart condition who had to push my wife from 1 terminal to another and I had to stop and rest while pushing. American airlines poor service for disabled and handicap persons is shameful to say the least.Update 5/27/21, American Airlines rep called left a voice-mail  with a 1-888-214-3282 phone # with ext 8270. When you call you get a recording from American Airlines asking for the extension and when you enter it, the recording says that extension doesn't exist. Tried pressing 0, recording says that extension doesn't exist either and no main menu for you to try to connect with their rep.. Shameful."
616,"Worst airline ever. We flew out of Louisville, KY on May 19, 2021 (still under pandemic restrictions). They packed the plane like a sardine can. Four days into our vacation, my husband and I both came down sick. We tried to get an early flight back home, but American said the price of tickets went up and we would have to pay extra. We're driving 897 miles back and American Airlines is giving us a credit for the last of our flight. News for you American......shove your credit where the sun don't shine. I'll be filing a complaint with BBB and the Attorney General's office."
617,"As someone who flies more than the average person, I‚Äôve flown American Airlines numerous times. The last trip I took was the WORST out of all the times I‚Äôve flown. First, our flight was delayed by FOUR hours, fine whatever, I go to the desk and they get me on flight that leaves for Dallas in 15 minutes causing me to lose the upgraded seats that I paid $$ for. The flight is full and I‚Äôm forced to check my carry on that contains a bridesmaid dress.  But at least I made it to Dallas right? Kind of. We were rerouted to Austin and sat on the tarmac for another FOUR HOURS. Finally make it to Dallas, and the flight to OKC is delayed but at least we make that. Get to OKC and find out the airline lost my bag. They mistagged it and couldn‚Äôt locate it. They reassure me that the bag will make it back to me in 24hrs. NOPE. I called every few hours for updates, first the bag is in Dallas, then Los Angeles, then CABO. Not only was my dress in Cabo, but it was handed off to UNITED AIRLINES. HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?  Spoiler alert: I didn‚Äôt get the dress back in time for the wedding and had to buy a dingy $20 dress from David‚Äôs bridal. So now I‚Äôm out over $200 on this trip due to the negligence of American Airlines. They offered me a $125 voucher, that doesn‚Äôt begin to cover my losses.  I demanded they put for the expensive bridesmaid dress I was supposed to wear as that is my biggest loss and they offered to pay for the dingy David‚Äôs bridal dress. STILL DOESN‚ÄôT COVER MY LOSSES. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I for one will not be flying American Airlines or recommending it to anyone. The customer service is horrible. They truly do NOT CARE about their customers."
618,My daughter had to wait on the phone for 3 hours which resulted in poor service and no resolution. Definitely will avoid American in the future.
619,"American airline by far is the worst airline .Never ever again fly with this airline.Horrible customer service.Flight was delayed, unable to catch connecting flight, had to stay in the hotel and pay 200$ for a night till following day-And they didn't refund me for the cost!! 978-407-8002"
620,"Absolutely the worst airlines!  I signed up for texts for any changes with flights.  The only texts I received for flights that I was not booked on.  So there was a last minute gate change and I almost missed my flight because it was so far away.  The flight attendants are rude.  The whole Covid situation has really put some people on a power trip.  The planes are packed - is a mask really going to save our lives?  Especially when the plane was filthy.  I always wipe my seat and tray w/ a sanitizing wipe.  Each flight my wipes were dirty.  And the bathroom on TWO flights had feces - yes feces- smeared on the wall of the tiny restrooms.  A man sitting across from me was removed prior to takeoff because apparently they were unhappy with his masking.  However, from the time I sat down until he was kicked off his mask was on and correct.  When and if life ever gets back to normal I may consider flying again. But it will NEVER be with American Airlines."
621,I would have given them no stars if it was possible.
622,Very disappointed with the American Airlines agent at the PHX airport! My husband was carrying my daughters bag for her and the agent accused him of having too many carry on bags and made us check it in. She dismissed any explanation and was very rude. Not impressed!!
623,Waited over an hour on the phone and gave up. No one is coming to answer the call
624,American Airlines Investigating Pilot Who Opposes School District‚Äôs Critical Race Theory PlanIf the above is true you not see me or my family sitting in any American Airline seats again.
625,the customer service for this airline is non existent. 6 plus hours the app chat wont function properly. Agents hang up on you after 3 hour wait. contact on twitter tells you to DM them and then doesnt reply. currently abroad and need to change my flight.
626,"Today at LGA, headed to Washington. Our agent at where you initially check in bags (at the New terminal B) was superb. Her name is Charmaine. She went above and beyond. She helped us 1) connect an AA MasterCard Platinum select card to our account (which makes the first bag free) 2) had a great attitude and 3) helped us gets seats together on both legs of our flight where they were both separate. I was expecting the possibility of a grumpy, unhelpful person, but Charmaine was super helpful and a benefit to AA in every way. She should be teaching agents how to do their job. I spent a long time on hold with AA last night to no avail and was expecting a ‚Äúyou have to do this online‚Äù type of response, but no- super super helpful and took her time.  -Brian and Heather F, flight AA2119, advantage flyers"
627,"Once again American Airlines ruins our vacation!  Got up at 3:45am. to catch an early flight at Reagan International only to find out it was delayed 5 hours.  Of course now we miss our connection in Chicago and so they rebooked us economy instead of the first class we paid for.  No were sorry, well make it up to you, just a kiss my ass we suck and have a nice day.  So instead of getting to our destination at 11am. we now get there 8 hours later at 7pm.  Oh and lets not forget the four hour lay over in Chicago.  American Airlines you suck and this is the last vacation you are going to ruin because I will never fly you again!  I will also be cancelling my American Airlines credit card I have had for over 20 years and run hundreds of thousands of dollars through every year.  No more of your old run down flight attendants or lazy gate attendants with attitudes.  No more watching your lowsy ground crew throw bags around when they could just set them down easy.  No more first class and you don't serve food because your to cheap and don't give me the Covid excuse because other airlines are serving food.  I know that you don't care that you are loosing a good loyal customer and you probably don't care that I will be telling everyone I know how bad you are and I don't fly American any more.  I have to go now because I have to get on Facebook and let my 5000 followers know how bad you are.  Never again!!!!!"
628,"Losing my job because American Airlines S u c k s. If they Knew there was a flight delay they should have Held the connection flight. Since it‚Äôs the Only connection flight. Have to spend the night at the airport with no food or drink or anything because their customer service is NonExistent. I hope this company goes under. Buying tickets from them was a mistake. I wish I spent more money for literally Any Other Airline. I literally cannot believe they didn‚Äôt hold the connection flight when there was No Other Flight. For more than 8 hours!! It would have only been held for like half an hour. Like. Seriously? Thanks for ruining my entire life, scumbags."
629,"I had a trip package to Jamaica a few weeks ago. I got to the airport just to find out that the flight out of Philadelphia was delayed because of technical problems and that we were going to miss the connection flight to Jamaica. And that they weren‚Äôt going to be able to get us out there till the following day. Short version- rude unhelpful agents at the airport (long line). Was told checked bag was going to be transferred to the next day flight, and to submit claims of expenses online. Went back home and came back the next day after wasting a PTO day. Came back early to make sure check bag was transferred since I once had a lost bag issue with the same airline. I kept getting brushed off by agent at check-in desk and again agent at the gate when I insisted I wanted to confirm that my bag was flying with on this trip and that i wanted to make sure while there‚Äôs still time to do something about it.I kept getting answers like ‚Äúit should follow your change of itinerary‚Äù. I kept saying that that wasn‚Äôt assuring but the rude agents couldn‚Äôt careless. I got to Jamaica and just as I feared, NO LUGGAGE! I had to pay over $550 in expenses for date change to the resort and transportation and least I expected was to be refunded. I was only offered a $150 voucher for all my troubles. Did I mention I am a PLATINUM member! No wonder the airline is in the condition it‚Äôs at. Spirit at this point seems appealing. PAY A LITTLE MORE AND FLY DELTA! I will be traveling 2-3 times per week for work. I guess I‚Äôll be taking my membership elsewhere!"
630,"One of the Worst airlines I hate traveling with. Spirit is better at this point. The planes suck. Tv‚Äôs don‚Äôt work half the time, WiFi doesn‚Äôt work. Seats are awful. Stuck on the tarmac and they don‚Äôt even offer water. Nowhere to plug phones. Small seats even though I upgraded my seats for an extra $150 I have no shoulder space. First class is more like 3rd class.. $700 Roy trip flight to Vegas from Oklahoma and I would‚Äôve been pissed if I paid half. Unacceptable. I hope I can avoid ever flying with them again.. DELTA DELTA DELTA"
631,"A month after I reserved my tickets, AA emailed me updated itineraries that are significantly worse. I now have a flight leaving at 6:45am (instead of 9:45 as scheduled) and a 5-hour layover in Chicago. No communication other than the changes. No way to adjust the times. I'm just stuck flying on whatever planes they assign me, apparently?"
632,"My son and daughter-in-law moved to Costa Rica this past weekend and flew out on AA. They wanted to take their emotional support animal, Ruby, with them and were instructed by AA on the steps to be taken. They were told that the she could be checked as baggage and the costs. AA also explained that the Ruby would have to fly out of somewhere below 85 degrees with a direct flight. We live in Arkansas and there was not a direct flight and the temperatures were in the low 80's in Dallas so we drove 780 miles to Charlotte, NC in order for them to fly the Ruby with them. When they checked in, they were informed that the she could not go!! They said they had stopped transporting animals as luggage 2 years ago!!!! This was a HUGE error by the airlines. Not only were we out a lot of money for the trip, but my son and his wife had to board a plane in tears because they had to leave their precious Ruby behind. A manager at the airport could see all the documentation where my son had been told all of the details about what to do yet none of that mattered. Now we have to make arrangements to have Ruby flown as cargo which means another trip somewhere. It also means we have to have all of the paperwork redone since the dates of the flight have all been changed. This is TOTALLY unacceptable!! It's not like they were only going for a visit, they moved their entire life to another country and wanted their dog, a registered service animal, with them."
633,"I would give them negative stars if I had the ability. The representatives on the phone are not helpful, happy, or respectful. Would not discuss different fares with me and kept trying to transfer me to different departments even though all I needed was to book a flight. Initial wait was 4.5 hours and they transferred me to a different department and I waited over an hour before hanging up. Abysmal service. Two thumbs down!!"
634,"I had a very bad experience coming out of Cancun, aa employees from the front desk to the  gate are either overworked or plain nasty, rude‚Ä¶. Okay, I got to the airport early went thru check point and inmigration got to the gate, while sitting there (near the boarding gate/door) I was approached by an individual that looked more like a janitor than security to ask me where was I traveling that day, I responded ‚ÄúPhiladelphia‚Äù, I thought it was a service to make sure passengers are sitting at the right gate so they don‚Äôt miss their flight, perfect ! As soon as I said Philadelphia he asked for my boarding pass and passport, I said to him ‚Äúwho are you and whom do you work for that you‚Äôre asking for my passport and boarding pass‚Ä¶ SIR READ MY TAG !! I know how to read as a matter of fact 3 languages but ‚Äúprivate security it‚Äôs not telling me anything‚Äù so if you are not willing to tell me who you are or whom you work for ‚Äúhave a good day sir‚Äù you‚Äôre not getting my passport or boarding pass,, THE AA employees were listening to the entire conversation‚Ä¶ when it was time for me to board the fight ‚ÄúGUESS‚Äù I was sent  by the AA employeee that were listening for a thorough inspection, they had something set up on the side of the gate, same thing ‚ÄúPRIVATE SECURITY‚Äù I asked again ‚Äúguys who do you work for‚Äù this time I guess the supervisor at the gate came up to instruct the guys not to give me no explanation whatsoever‚Ä¶. And turned to me to tell me ‚ÄúI AM THE AUTHORITY HERE‚Äù no they‚Äôre not to give you no explanation or names and if you Wanna board this flight ‚Äúyou better cooperate and follow the instructions‚Äù and I said to him, so you want to tell me that this is a policy from American Airlines ?? at the time i also noticed they were looking for narcotics, I mean every piece of clothing even the handles on the Carry-ons and book bags and of-course shoes  hats  you name it, i meant complete inspection‚Ä¶ I also noticed they were only pulling  people of color to be checked,  we were all black (I‚Äôm afro-Latino), and I said to him, How come I only see people of color being pulled  to be checked for narcotics‚Ä¶(7 of us, all black)  only people of color are criminals ??, you can believe whatever you wanna believe, that was his answer‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm gonna repeat myself again if you want to get on this flight you better cooperate‚Ä¶. I got back to the states, wrote to aa customer relations and no answer‚Ä¶.I guess if you are black,, or and individual of color don‚Äôt go to Cancun you are gonna be targeted and treated as a criminal with the blessing of American Airlines,,and it‚Äôs employees.. I‚Äôm waiting for an answer from American Airlines so I can contact the department of state so I can get a better answer as to why ‚ÄúI need to surrender a US government document (passport) to individuals with a tag reading ‚Äúprivate security‚Äù And no explanation from them or American Airlines employees  as far as who they are‚Ä¶. Or whom they work for, And why only ‚Äú people of color‚Äù‚Ä¶.are been targeted !!!"
635,I‚Äôd like to share my experience with American Airlines. This was the worst experience flying on an airplane to date for a multitude of reasons. The flight attendants were nasty and this airline completely disregards social distancing guidelines. They overbooked the flight and crammed over 150 passengers on a plane together. Not sure how this is even allowed when local restaurants aren‚Äôt even allowed to fill their tables that would give way more separation then on a plane. They are so strict with wearing masks unless you are eating or drinking something because apparently we can‚Äôt spread Covid while eating or drinking. They don‚Äôt take your temperature when boarding the plane and honestly other then the mask they do absolutely nothing to diminish the spread of Covid. This is stupidly at its finest and the fact that small mom and pop businesses aren‚Äôt allowed to come close to operating at this capacity speaks volumes of the corruption in our country and society today. This is disgusting and I‚Äôm completely appalled by this type of hypocrisy. It‚Äôs sad the amount of sheep in the world that follow stupid guidelines that are riddled with double standards. I strongly advise anyone who has the ability to use logic and common sense to find a different airline because this is downright dumb. It‚Äôs sad the it‚Äôs a federal law to wear your mask and yet again social distancing is deemed unnecessary while on an airplane. It‚Äôs only deemed unnecessary because the airlines stand to lose too much money. However a small local business is required to operate under all Covid safety guidelines and as a result many are losing their homes and so much more. We live in a corrupt society where the more money you have the more you can get away with. American Airlines is only concerned about $$$ and your safety is obviously of little concern to this multi million dollar corporation. I honestly prefer not to wear a mask. However don‚Äôt act like you are keeping me safe by sticking me next to someone I never met before shoulder to shoulder as if my mask has secret powers I wasn‚Äôt aware of. My next trip to Florida I will be driving because I just can‚Äôt deal with this level of stupidity. In Florida I had the choice to wear a mask or not in most places. That‚Äôs what freedom is all about and not this manipulative garbage.
636,"Worst airline. Have avoided them for years due to endless delays and permanently lost luggage.  Booked flight out of Savannah to O‚ÄôHare with great reluctance.  12:30 p.m. departure has been delayed 5 times, current departure 7:58.  No reason given for delays.  Never again.  Go Southwest. Even with multiple layovers you will arrive sooner.  I would be embarrassed to work for this airline."
637,"It has been 2 years since my wife, and I have been able to take a much-needed international vacation. With the passing of my grandfather, a decorated military veteran, and the tumultuous cancer recovery of several family members, we decided to travel American Airlines to Mexico City. Per our expectations, the trip to DFW was a safe, and uneventful first leg of our journey. As well, our trip to MEX, from DFW seemed routine, until we noticed, and photographed what could only be described as slimy residue (upon the chairs in front of us) from previous passengers. These leftover remnants of flights passed are unacceptable sanitation practices, especially given the reach of a global pandemic. Nonetheless, we attempted to assign these omissions of safeguarding to a specific cleaning crew, or a particular region of the plane, while giving the airline a tightly girded benefit of the doubt. Our trip home, on the other hand, was a safety and logistics nightmare. After arriving 3 hours early to the airport, in plenty of time to make our flight, and get my hypoglycemic wife a bite to eat, we were met with a 100+ person AA check-in line. Our contention falls with the misinformation from staff (regarding the filling out of medical questionnaires), the allowing of many other passengers, who arrived late, to cut an already overwhelming line, and the seemingly chaotic organization of the AA personnel. We only made it to our gate as the flight was boarding the last group (less than 15 minutes to takeoff), my wife had no chance to eat, and the ticket agent had forgotten to give us our boarding passes for our connecting flight. As the trip continued, there remained only a simple, one hour flight home to MCI. As we boarded flight 2267, and settled in, many passengers noticed the loud and obnoxious cell phone conversations of the passenger sitting directly to my left. The young man was yelling obscenities, dropping the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word with free reign, and what was obvious to many, attempting to collect drug money. While he was making others overtly uncomfortable, I told him that he should consider toning down his words, as he is concerning the other passengers. To this he replied with what was a direct threat to my safety, an ‚Äúinvitation‚Äù to take care of this outside of the airplane. I notified both the AA Captain, sitting across the aisle from me, and the flight attendant, who was within 4 aisles of my seat, that this guy was being verbally threatening. Though many of the surrounding passengers heard my attempts to notify the airline employees, nothing was done to quell this passenger‚Äôs unacceptable behavior. My safety was unnecessarily jeopardized, and nothing was done to ameliorate my situation. In fact, the AA pilot sitting next me quietly advised me to keep quiet about the interaction as AA will take this as a ‚Äúlevel one‚Äù investigation, a burden that should be kept as a good life story. Of the over 300 flights I have taken, this was one of the most hectic, unsafe, and unprofessional displays of ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù. My wife and I do not feel safe on an AA flight, and do not see using, nor recommending this airline for future travel."
638,Used AA many times for personal reasons and even more times for business. I will never use AA again or any company you are associated with. I will and have been telling every business person I am associated with to not use AA or any company you are associated with. You are anti American and should be fined at a minimum. Disgusting.
639,"Part of having good customer service is managing a customer‚Äôs expectations. On multiple occasions the messaging by AA has been different from what I am being told by agents via phone & gate agents, to then reach out to customer relations and receive a completely different answer. We we're stranded for four extra four days out of the country by AA. They claimed a weather delay meanwhile other airline providers are flying under the same conditions. How do you offer no compensation at all? We‚Äôre having an extra four days of expenses that we didn‚Äôt pack for. After the thousands of dollars and hundreds of flights I‚Äôve booked with American Airlines what loyalty did they show back? When my flight was initially cancelled, I was told by customer service on the phone to request a hotel & food vouchers via email, only to again be denied by customer relations. Same story again with transportation. Ever since the US Airways merger the customer service has gone down to zero. I will urge my entire company to seek other providers when booking travel from now on."
640,Terrible service don‚Äôt use this airline no changes as stated no refunds screwed me out of a whole ticket
641,"AFTER BEING STRANDED IN MEXICO BY OUR CANADIAN GOVERNMENT (CANCELLING ALL CANADIAN FLIGHTS) WE HAD TO MAKE OUR WAY HOME VIA THE USA, SO WE BOOKED FLIGHTS: IE CANCUN TO DALLAS ON TO VEGAS THEN DENVER ONTO CALGARY, WE USED PRICELINE WHOM WE HAVE USED IN THE PAST WITH NO PROBLEMS AND ALL WAS WELL UNTIL OUR FLIGHT TO DENVER OUT OF VEGAS, WE ARRIVED WITH PLENTY OF TIME EVEN THOUGH UNITED BROUGHT OUR FLIGHT FORWARD THIRTY MINUTES , WHEN WE TRIED TO CHECK IN THE DESK PERSON WHO WAS REALLY IGNORANT AND RUDE INFORMED US WE HAD TO HAVE AN ARRIVE- CAN NUMBER AND COVID TEST AND SHE WOULD NOT LET US ON THE FLIGHT,WE INFORMED HER THAT WE DID NOT NEED THE COVID TEST UNTIL BOARDING THE CALGARY BOUND FLIGHT AND WE HAD MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE IT DONE IN DENVER AIRPORT.AND COMPLETE THE ARRIVE-CAN PAPERWORK.  SHE CANCELLED OUT OUR PAID FOR TICKETS AND WE THEN HAD TO PURCHASE NEW TICKETS FROM UNITED AIRLINES FOR THE SAME FLIGHT, WHICH DID NOT MAKE ANY SENSE OTHER THAN A CASH GRAB.   SO AFTER BEING ROBBED OF OUR MONEY WE WERE ALLOWED TO BOARD THE EXACT FLIGHT WE WERE PREVIOUSLY DENIED ENTRY TO, AND AS A RESULT WE ARRIVED IN DENVER AND TOOK OUR COVID TEST COMPLETED OUR ARRIVE-CAN PAPERWORK AND HAD TO GET A HOTEL TO TAKE A LATER FLIGHT HOME WHICH LEFT THE NEXT DAY ALL BECAUSE OF AN OBNOXIOUS LITTLE JOBS WORTH WHO THOUGHT SHE KNEW BEST, WE ARE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS OUT OF POCKET DUE TO AMERICAN AIRLINES FRONT DESK STAFF. I WILL NEVER FLY WITH THIS COMPANY AGAIN AND TRYING TO REACH SOME ONE TO COMPLAIN TO AT AMERICAN AIRLINES IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE, I THOUGHT BEING STRANDED ABROAD WAS THE WORST THING TO HAPPEN TO US BUT THAT WAS BEFORE WE HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS AIRLINE. THE ONLY POSITIVE THING I CAN SAY IS THAT THE AMERICAN AIRLINES STAFF AT DENVER AIRPORT WERE TOP NOTCH ,VERY HELPFUL AND UNDERSTANDING TO OUR PLIGHT IN THESE TRAUMATIC TIMES."
642,American Airline Charlotte is a joke.I get we were delayed because of weather however they stopped boarding the plane because an international flight landed and need to use the terminal to unloaded their passengers. Plus we had to dump fuel because we on a shorter flight than the plane original destination. This process took and 1 hour and 15 minutes.We get our bags and one has lost a wheel.Can't push luggage with 3 wheels so we just dragged it to the parking garage.The flight attendants are so rude! They think they can be because it a federal guidelines to wear a mask.Pointing fingers and yelling to pull up your mask doesn't work.
643,If you want to get treated like a jerk just come on till American Airlines and the flight attendants will treat you like trash. They have little to no training on how to wear a mask first of all. And then if they don‚Äôt like how you‚Äôre wearing it they‚Äôre going to kick you off if you have anything to say back to them about it. Thanks a lot American Airlines for being so disrespectful and inconveniencing your customers you all should teach your attendance on how to leave customers alone and not create problems with the customers over a mask. I realize there‚Äôs a mask mandate but if someone has a covering their mouth and nostrils you guys should leave them alone you guys want to push the issue until you got the mask covering your eyeballs shame on the flight attendants who caused passengers Misery
644,"I would never recommend flying this airline.  My bag was a carry on which they made me check for no reason.  From Charlotte to Cedar Rapids, somehow by bag was damaged and not repairable.  I tried several times to file a claim and also tried calling several times.  I was finally able to get through to an actual person today and was told that I only had 24 hours to file a claim.  I explained that it should've been a carry-on and they never should've made me check it and she said they can't guarantee anything.  I am frustrated that this was a brand new suitcase and now needs to be thrown away due to their mishandling."
645,"Missed my flight due to the AA providing the wrong gate number.  I went to the gate provided only for the agent to tell me it's the wrong gate. The gate info wasn't on my boarding pass. I use the app.. I explained to them I had to get home to my grandmother's funeral. The only thing they could say was I can only be put on stand-by. The ticketing counter at Dallas Ft-worth were no help , They were rude.  Which wasn't even guaranteed. I had to pay for a whole new flight no refund,no help. I won't be flying American again."
646,So planned a trip to go to Pittsburg on 4/2/2021. My flight to was with Delta. My flight back on 4/4/2021 was with AA. On 3/31/2021 my wife came down with pneumonia and Covid which I had to cancel my trip. Called Delta and they gave me a refund because of a family emergency. Called AA and Donna (RDB) and some other rude lady told me that they will not refund my money to my account and that don't never fly with them again and tough that my wife got sick. I could use the money a paid to fly with them but to use it they will charge me $50 to use credits. Never again I will use American Airlines.
647,"My flights on Aa have always been ok, not particularly great but not bad. My usual flight is around 3 hours so I don‚Äôt have to deal with missing meals while flying. I have to say I am a little disappointed in Aa lately because there were several people on my last flight who were blatantly wearing their masks incorrectly. I‚Äôm taking, mouth and nose out. Nobody said anything to those people, and i felt unsafe."
648,"This deserves 0 stars. I travel quite frequently and have never had this type of experience. Last June I paid for a flight to surprise my son with a trip for his birthday in January. Unfortunately I had to cancel and rebook due to covid. I was Informed I‚Äôd be able to use all my money towards the reschedule. Wrong. When rebooking I was advised that I had Two types of credits, ticket credit and evoucher and they could not be combined despite each being associated with the same 2 original ticket holders. I was Iinformed to go online and request a refund or transfer to e voucher. 1. I was Denied the transfer 2. The $122 I was Refunded was sent to a closed bank account! I can‚Äôt even contact them to advise them of this issue and was told ‚Äúmy bank will send a check‚Äù. It‚Äôs a bank that no longer exists due to a merger. 2. I would never receive a refund for my evoucher 3. The flight rate increased. Yesterday I paid $1159.47, which included the evoucher credit of $948, I am Still out $400 in ticket credits and to top it off... I was Double charged for my ticket. 3 separate transactions! 1 with $1159.47 and 2 additional charges of $610.80 and 548.60! I am Beyond upset and disappointed with your company especially considering the only thing I wanted Was to use ALL my original credits to this re booked flight. You have lost my trust and my business."
649,"Worst Airline Ever. Discriminated against my friend, she is an Asian American. Before taking off, she was sitting in her seat after boarding, they told her to stand up and did another temperature check using the excuse of covid, what a shame."
650,"Never on time, gates change frequently, unorganized, expensive and The Worst Airline."
651,"Dallas to Chicago flight.  Delay and no additional food or drink.  We didn't crash, so I can't complain too much. Stewardess was cute so that helped."
652,I would like to preface my review by saying that I am a frequent flying and have flown no less than 6 times in the last 3 months. I have never had an on time flight. I‚Äôm currently in an airport with a two hour maintenance delay. I‚Äôm going to be stuck in my connecting city. The best American can do for me is say to go ahead and get on my 2 hr delayed flight and hope for the best once I get there. It is a garbage company. I can‚Äôt even control my flights on the app so I have call and wait on hold to talk to someone. Or I can wait in the line with 50 people in it to talk to one agent available just to try and reschedule my flight. They also seem to lose my luggage often. I only fly AA if I have absolutely no other option.
653,"I contacted this airline in order to get a credit from a year ago. According to the manager Mo Faheem who is very rude and unprofessional, they cannot tell you your ticket number or record locator which means they get to keep your money. So much for having computers in 2021 when an airline doesn‚Äôt keep records of people who buy their tickets. I‚Äôm sure if the state police or FBI needed the information they would be able to find it. Your welcome AA for my donation. All passengers you‚Äôve been warned."
654,I bought the tickets together and made me pay to have the seats next to each other! these people are greedy and I don't know how may times we see greed go bad that people like American Airlines will ever learn...
655,"These 'people' must be stopped.I am British and am not allowed to enter the US so our contract is broken. They want to stamp on it and keep every disgusting penny. They don't have to fly me. They make even more money for not having to fly me and the Agency untouched. You FIRKIN pay to not enter our country through no fault of your own you mug! The agency rubbing their hands with fees. I'll be chasing this sick US airline to the ends of the Earth to get My money back from these charlatans. We're keeping every penny, giving you the finger, and we do not give a shet if you can enter the country of contract or not. I'll start by reviewing systematically. The BBB. My bank. Then the UK civil courts. I'm going to enjoy it you rotten bunch of shysters.They've taken loads in fees and taxes that they will not pay, so now I have to investigate all that as well. Should I be surprised with the US and its money is everything policy, keeping nob-due taxes and authority charges no longer payable given I can't, erm, enter the bloody country due to Covid and the US government banning it."
656,American Airlines have finally lost me as a customer after years of being one. Check in took over an hour. Nobody and I mean nobody was friendly. No greeting getting on the plane or off. So sad to see this airline go down hill like the way it has. Four hour flight just to receive a small bottle of water and some cookies. I was in shock to see the difference from when I flew United in February.
657,Last time flying with AA. Horrible service. May as well not even have flight attendants. Ever since covid they have gotten so lazy.
658,"Trash. They do not care about passengers. Even if you're on time, waiting at the gate, with a ticket."
659,"Just okay, not bad but not extraordinary either. If you fly in a Boeing it's a pretty comfortable ride, otherwise anything else is just really cramped and the cabin pressure really hurts my ears on decent/take-off."
660,I flew on American Airlines from the United States to Jamaica in December 2016. American Airlines lost my luggage. They promised me that they would compensate me but they never did. I recently complained about them still not having compensated me even though it has been more  than four years. A representative from American Airlines telephoned me today to discuss my complaint. This person told several lies about the history of this issue. It is bad enough that I have had to wait so long in order to be paid such a small amount of money;¬† but on top of all that the unprofessional behaviour and the brazen evasion of responsibility are just unacceptable.
661,I will never fly this airline again. Mask Nazi‚Äôs!! I have a perfectly good mask(gator) that I just used in a AA flight from Orlando to NC and now these people  make me use a pos surgical blue white mask and my gator. Covid is NOT as deadly of a disease. It has been proven! Get your hubs on the same page. Then you cram us in a over crowded airline. If your so worried about covid then maybe you should space the passengers out and get some friendly people because this crew is rude!!!
662,"AA had a delayed flight for 5 hours from Orlando.I had to arrive before 2pm in Phoenix to perform.The AA counter staff was terrible, saying that they can not do anything for me. Neither book me on another flight that would arrive on time, neither refund or credit my AA account.I had to book another flight on another Airlines companies without knowing if AA will refund or credit my accountVERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND POLICY!!"
663,Employee johnathon Clark at security gate was very rude and disrespectful towards me I will not be traveling with american again made my whole trip bad experience. I think he very racist and shouldn't be working at airport.
664,"The worse Airline in the world. I‚Äôve had 6 trips cancellations and they don‚Äôt care. They only care about them, to get more money. American Airlines‚Äô policy is unfair and insane! If you think to book a trip with AA, you rather shop around and find another Airline, you are going to waste your time and your money. They don‚Äôt care about passengers, they lie. If you are thinking to travel to Cuba with AA now, you better wait and go with JetBlue. I lost my job because of AA. I‚Äôve claimed to change my trip for a closer date and they keep changing it for a farther date. I won‚Äôt never travel with this airline again."
665,"Complain, complain , Your lies, bad , bad customer services inhumanity, insensible, I never recommend American airline for travel"
666,Bought my tickets through Travelocity in July 2020 for a great price. AA changed the return flight times from 1:10 to 3:28 back in Oct 2020. I never received any notification. That change left me with 1 hour and 14 minutes to go through customs and meet my connecting flight in Miami. I contacted AA and they put the blame on Travelocity. I understand Travelocity should have notified me but AA made the changes that are impossible to keep. AA customer service wouldn't even talk to me.When we arrived at the FPO airport to come home the AA ticket person looked at this ridiculous schedule and changed us to a flight where we were now leaving Miami the next day. Keep in mind I am 59 and my husband is 63. I asked her if we are supposed to sleep on the airport floor. She told me to talk to the people at Miami.Because my tickets are now not connected I had to pick up my carry on in Miami and have it rechecked. AA wanted to charge me a second time for my checked baggage. I had to talk to those folks about the horrible mix-up that is all AAs fault before my baggage was accepted.Then they made me leave through a locking door into the terminal. I am no longer in the secure area. So now I not only have to sleep on the floor but I am now unable to access food. I tried to reenter but TA would not let me pass because our tickets were for tomorrow.The only saving grace for your horrible airlines was the manager in Miami. She was the first one in all of this nightmare that even bothered to listen to us. What should have been an easy flight home from a great vacation turned into hell! You really need to have customer service that listens to your customers instead of blowing us off to the next stop. This could have all been avoided if you didn't allow changes that were impossible to keep. That is all on you!
667,I opened a citibank card from the american airlines website to get the 250.00 credit towards my flight. I got approved and the approval rules were sent to my email but not the credit card info. I was not able to book the flight on the card to get the credit because I didn't have the info of the card. I called american airlines and the wait was an hour so I called citibank to get my card info and they would not give it to me. I booked a flight on frontier instead of waiting 10 days to get my credit card and having the flight price go up. I will not use the credit card when it comes and american airlines and citibank will get no business from me. Im not sure how this benefits either company. Bad experience using American Airlines.
668,"Feb 13 /2021 at New York/ LGA Airport To Aruba.We are family of 4 me my wife and 2 kids were on the line to check in. After 30 min we got the 1st place  to check in one of AA employee approached us and told us to follow her. Her name is Joni (Lead agent) I asked her to where ? While she is walking front of us, she didn‚Äôt respond not even looked at her back. She took us to other side of counter that people do check in. I thought that they are splitting people to make check in faster because she put us front of counter. (There was no one front of the computer but she said that we have to stay there and she left us) Then we start to waiting there, litterly after 2 min another AA employee approached us her name is Rose (she said she is main manager) and she yelled us that we can‚Äôt wait there we have to go back to the end of the line. I try to explain her that someone took us there but she didn‚Äôt listen and yelled us loudly front of everyone. When i asked her why don‚Äôt you just listen first? She ignored us and pointed us with her finger end of the line that we have to go back. Everyone there who came after us got check in before us. After waiting another 30 minutes top of that they charge us luggage fee while me and my wife has AA Airlines Credit card from Citibank. Which thats the only reason we were caring these cards. Disrespectful and poor customer service ."
669,American Airlines rescheduled our flight and then a GAVE AWAY our first class tickets to someone else the night before our flight. They said the computer did it but they could rebook us in economy. They gave our tickets away and wanted us to forgive them for putting us in economy.... and then we have to file a complaint to try and get the difference back.....me and my husband both have health problems that is the reason for first class tickets and now they want us to forgive them for making someone else a higher priority than us after we already booked our tickets.....BAD BUSINESS.
670,"I just took a flight from Fenix to Miami with the worst experience possible. Poor onboard service, cold and rude professionals. They really need to improve it."
671,12 hour fog delay...both departure and arrival airports were still operating...or communicating contempt for customers with lies...they announced a delay more than an hour before scheduled departure...
672,"poor service,,,I paid for 1st class,yet when I got on the tiny ass plane. There was no first class, not one peanut, not one drop of water..My connecting flight out of Dallas was over 2hours late.  I will never fly American again."
673,Worst staff. Never AA again
674,I had a ticket and was not able to travel due to COVID. I was moving and ended up driving. I called to refund and was even willing to transfer to someone else since I couldn't use it and I was told I had to travel by 12 2021 or I would lose my money nothing they could or would do. If it were my fault I'd understand but we were all told not to travel by plane it due to covid if possible so I take the advice and. Now I. Out 300. Definitely not caring about customers. I called and emailed over and over now almost a year later still no response until I called again today and they aren't willing to help in any way literally said I have to.make a trip or lose my money.
675,"Awful. My flight was delayed due to weather causing me to arrive at my connecting flight exactly at departure time. I get to the gate, the plan is still there, the Pusey gate agent said we don‚Äôt hold the seats for late arrivals so your seat was given away to standby customers.  Can you believe that? She knew we landed, she knew we were on our way as fast as possible, but no curtesy to accommodate customers. Now I‚Äôm waiting 8 hours for the next flight. I will no longer accumulate miles with this airline and I will avoid them whenever possible. Boy do I miss the good old days when airlines actor tried to accommodate their customers."
676,"Guess the new communist attitude in America is spreading like wildfire... My boyfriend & I were just kicked off of a flight because the over zealous flight attendant thought we had an attitude with her! No one raised their voice, no one was aggressive or derogatory yet they delayed the flight to have security remove us! Unbelievable, we are sitting in the airport selling off all of our AA stock right now!!!!! DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES"
677,"I used American Airlines to buy flights to Guatemala from London. I'd saved up for this trip for 3 years. The journey consisted of a flight from Heathrow to Dallas, and then Dallas to Guatemala. The return trip was from Guatemala to Miami and then Miami to Heathrow. This all came to ¬£645.26. Unfortunately, the outbreak of covid 19 meant that I couldn't go as my flights were cancelled from London. I felt relieved as I received an email from American Airlines that my tickets were ""safe"" and I could buy a new ticket equal to their worth, I was given a year to use them. Obviously I haven't been able to use them, like many others, I'm in desperate need of money as I was made redundant. American Airlines is only refunding me for the flight from Heathrow to Dallas, A FLIGHT THAT THEY CANCELLED WHICH RESULTED IN ME NOT BEING ABLE TO GET ON ANY OTHER FLIGHT. I am only being offered ¬£64!!!! that's less than 10% of what I paid for the ticket(S).I am absolutely appalled, American Airlines has robbed me of my money. Customer care have ignored my questions and simply told me to ""wait for the refund to be processed (for only 1 flight)""!!!!Disgusting behaviour. I will be seeking legal action to retrieve my money."
678,Bad experience I do not recommend this airline to anyone please look for other options but do not fly with these scammers
679,"Just bad. It's been 10 months they are playing hot potato with Vayama, as no one wants to refund me, or even propose another solution for a cancelled flight. They say they issued the refund but here we are, it's been 10 months and nothing..."
680,"If I could select 0 starts I would.  The understaffed airport in Sioux Falls couldn't get myself or the 50 people around me checked in to any of our flights, causing many of us to miss them.  There was only 1 person at the check in desk who himself admitted ""we are very understaffed, next time you will have to come earlier"""
681,"The departing flight changed by 3.5 hours. I called to ask for a refund and was rejected.  A few weeks later the flight home was changed as well, by 2.5 hours....  Neither of these worked for us.  I called to ask for a refund (not credit) and was told ti had to be a 4 hour change.  I explained it was a 6 hour change (if you considered both ways).  The customer service rep then said 'yes, the I DID QUALIFY for a full refund, since it was over 4 hours'.  He said he would cancel my flight but I would need to go online to request the refund.  I asked 'what if my refund is denied' and he said it would not be because he was putting notes in my file saying he approved the refund.  He canceled my flight, I submitted the online request for refund and received an email saying my request was DENIED!!!  I spent hours and hours trying to get ahold of someone. The only forum is the online system that sends them an email. I explained that a customer service rep told me I would get  full refund. They just kept denying my refund. I was finally able to talk to a cust serv rep on the phone to explain situation and she said that there were no notes in my file and I did not qualify for a refund.  I WAS FLAT OUT LIED TO BY A CUSTOMER SERVICE REP AND NO ONE CARES AT ALL!!!!!!  I will not fly American anymore....  They can make all kinds of changes to flight times and you are at their mercy.  And they you cannot trust what you are being told by the customer service reps.  This makes me sick to my stomach knowing there is some AA rep out there laughing at me because he just told me what I wanted to hear and he KNEW he was misinforming me (to get me off his back).  Do not expect any compassion or sympathy from this airline.... I am done with them!!"
682,Flew with AA recently and I must say that I wasn't very impressed with their covid measures. Amicable staff as always.
683,"I just flew on flight AA1532, January 3, 2020.They advertise that all flights are cleaned well before passengers enter.We had connections and videos are shown how they are cleaning the plane.I was the first passengers on the back of the plane, so I decided to use the bathroom to avoid using after so many people special with the COVID situation.When I went inside there was feces all over the toilet seat and toilet in the bathroom.Unacceptable!This means the bathroom was NOT clean before passengers entering like they advertised.During the COVID pandemic the WHOLE plane should be clean and sanitize.We took Clorox wipes and wiped everything.Like we expected they are not cleaning as usual.Be careful and prepared."
684,Love AA. Always helpful staff and support. Quick with refunds!
685,"I have flown with AA several times. I missed my flight, the ticket agents were very helpful in getting me in the next flight. I would give them 5 stars if the plane wasn‚Äôt filled to capacity"
686,"I flew recently, December 23rd 2020, from Detroit to Dallas (AA2491) and I have never heard a more dictatorship attitude from a flight attendant during her pre-flight announcement in all my 30+ years of flying.  This woman was just shy of saying those who are unable to wear a mask will get their s**t and get off the plane.  I understand the need to wear a mask in such close quarters but to state it in such a ""I am the boss and you will do what i say"" manner is very very unprofessional.  There are much better and empathetic ways to relay the importance of wearing a mask and the airlines policy if you are unable than to act like a dictator and the passengers are the unworthy of any respect.  So congratulations Miss Stalin on successfully changing my perception of how a professional flight attendant conducts themself no matter the situation."
687,"This is a formal complaint against a ticketing agent name, OKI at the Syracuse NY airport.  Very rude and impolite.  He made fun of my accent as none American and mimicked the way a speak.  I wasn‚Äôt even talking to him I was frustrated that they couldn‚Äôt let go of a half pound over my luggage. Really it was just half a pound extra. I understand rules are rules but I‚Äôve flown thousands of times and never had someone being so strict.  I was talking to the agent who was helping me and he jumped in the middle of the conversation and sarcastically said, ‚Äúmaybe you need to learn how to pack better next time.‚Äù I told him you are so rude I‚Äôm not even talking to you. He said everyone follow rules, I told him you are liar because not everyone follow rules then he start mimicking my accent and making fun of it in front of my 6 year old daughter .. I start asking him to stop talking to me and he kept talking back at me even though I kept asking him to stop talking to me. Then I stoped talking and he kept going sarcastically saying things and lowering his voice just enough for me to hear him and I told him NOW YOU NEED TO REALLY SHUT YOUR MOUTH. I stopped talking but he kept being nasty and rude to me.  I‚Äôm taking this to every social media I have. I‚Äôm planning on going back to the airport later this week and speak to a direct supervisor.  He needs to learn better etiquette how to deal with customers. If American Airline keep such a person like this as their customer service face, then American Airline will lose lots of customers.  I‚Äôve never in all my years traveling with all kind of airlines encountered such a humiliating situation. And his voice was loud where everyone in the airport was looking. Bad image for your counter when people pass and see your agent yelling at customers.  This is not the last you going to hear about this I feel so humiliated and if it wasn‚Äôt my daughter with me it would‚Äôve went bad.  I k ow this is my last time flying AA out of Syracuse."
688,"The flight attendant was the most rude most unprofessional, mumbling person I‚Äôve ever encountered while flying. I will never fly American Airlines thanks to her"
689,"I flew from salt lake to Dallas, I saw so many people on the plane with their mask down, their noses not even covered. No flight attendants came around telling people to put their mask up. The planes are packed and no recycled air. When I booked my trip, the price was decent. You get for what you paid for and I should of just booked with delta, they actually care about you and your safety. All they do is just announced to wear your mask but nothing else, no ENFORCING IT!!! I‚Äôm appalled at how American Airlines operated on this flight and I‚Äôm cancelling my return flight. I WILL NOT GO ON AMERICAN AIRLINES AGAIN and I want my money back.Boarding my second flight to Hawaii and they literally let a person into the plane with their mask halfway down, mouth and nose out! Didn‚Äôt stop them or tell them to pull their mask up, just scanned a ticket and let them in. WOW! Do not, I repeat DO NOT fly American Airlines!"
690,"If you like having your flights consistently changed and delayed, you'll love American Airlines. If not, then I would suggest flying with another airline."
691,Every time we fly with them it's a hassel never leave on time never make connected flight hope to never use them again
692,Never had a problem with this airline. Staff is always friendly and helpful. I hope this airline survives the COVID crisis.
693,Yall are just disgusting !!...I watched you kick off a family for their 2 year old not wanting to wear a mask...you peices of shhit!!! ...u should be ashamed of your self!! I hope u all rott with ur karma!!! I hope all the tears and heart ace u caused everyone else catches back up to you ...ill never use this airline!! And trust me ima tell my friends how un-American yall truly are!!!
694,"American Airlines is horrible. I do not recommend this airline to anyone . My flight was cancelled and rescheduled multiple times. The people at the boarding gate were rude and told me my carry on bag was to large . Almost made me miss my flight due to them making me throw clothes away in the airport so so bag would fit . They canceled their bag check at the gate, due to them making a statement that there  was not enough passengers on the plane . It was a nightmare with them. The staff was not helpful nor did they even care . Worst experience ever. Will never fly with American Airlines again. Plus their planes were junk."
695,Just a racism air It must be for the people in the first class Trash
696,"Allow their flight attendants to wear ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù pins, thus promoting the Marxist hate group, domestic terrorism, racism and anti-police politics. AA is also creating a ""diversity pin"" for all employees to wear on the job. Remember, diversity means discrimination based on race rather than merit. Instead, use Southwest."
697,"By far the most unprofessional company I have ever dealt with. Customer service absolutely non existent. No care in the world and the most disrespectful I have ever encountered. Charlotte Internation airport employees upon scanning to get on plane including their manager David have no respect, no sense of value, very discriminatory and will never fly with this company again. Nor will any of my 200 employees average 1500 round trip flights a year. Thanks for treating me and my family like crap."
698,American Airlines is a horrible airline. I purchased a flight with the wrong return date and then purchased the correct one and they won‚Äôt give me the full refund on the flight purchased by mistake despite purchasing another flight due to some arbitrary fee. I will never fly with American ever again as they care more about charging fees than their customers.
699,"Don't fly with this airline!!! The personal have no skills in comunication, not worth the headache!!"
700,Missed second flight because when we landed there was another plane in our terminal. American refused to get us a hotel because they blamed the weather even though it was their fault. Forced my toddler and pregnant wife to spend the night in the airport
701,"The most terrible experience today - they were not able to accommodate us with disability. They put us in the end of the plane to walk on crutches, even though we  were willing to pay for the seats in the front of the plane. The checkin desk person told us no need to buy tickets then, and that people at the gate will be able to accommodate us. No true! Everybody was extremely rude at the gate, don‚Äôt even try to assign us seats that are appropriate with injuries, more over they told us to board last, standing (on crutches) and waiting for all people to move thought the plane. On a top of that there was no room for our luggage, because we boarded last. Will never flight American again and don‚Äôt recommend anybody with special needs ever fly American!"
702,"The airplanes real garbage WOW the atenci√≥n fatal , no space in the airplane 4594"
703,"Flying with American Airlines is one of the worst decisionsyou can make in planningyour trip. It's a mistake We do not plan to make again. From the very start the customerservice was practicallynon existent. Our flights were changed multiple times without much time to do anything or get to the new flight. 4 of us paid extra to choose our own seats 4 separate times and didn't keep a single seat because American Airlines would change them last minute. My wife had a seat and an extra seat and at one point she had a seat on one flight with her extra seat on a totally separate flight. They can't seem to figure it out. We want to be refunded for all the seats we paid for and never sat in. Our connecting flights were even changed while we were flying to that airport and we weren't told until we arrived at the airport. Along with that, my wife needed to use the disabled cart services. The guys running the carts were standing around talking to each other instead of getting her to our gate and then they tried to close the doors on us. The lady at the gate told us we should have been faster if we wanted on the flight! My wife has a disabilitythat makes it hard to walk. SHE KEPT TELLING HER TO WALK FASTER TO THE PLANE WHEN SHE PHYSICALLY COULDNT!!! She was so disrespectful and rude. They tried not to honor her extra seat on the last flight out to Sacramento from Dallas Fort Worth. So many of our flights have been cancelled and rescheduled with little to no notice to get us onto the flights in time. The staff has been so rude and unhelpful during this entire time of flying to our destination and flying home. When we arrived to Sacramento, my wife  requested a wheelchair because of her physical disabilities and she was told NO by American Airlines flight attendants because she didn't use one in Dallas. She was on the disability cart in Dallas to get to our terminal faster (which the people in our group who walked beat us there because the guys driving the carts were standing around talking as we waited for them to stop socializing so we could get to our gates). So she was denied her wheelchair use while having a physical disability by American Airlines. American Airlines is a JOKE. Do not waste your money on these people. Fly with Delta, Southwest or United who seem to have better customer service skills and who will actually help you and fix their mistakes rather than blaming the customer for the error because American will not own up to their mistakes that they made! They are TRASH. When we first made our reservations we had to call them out on Twitter to get them to own up to their error because they wouldn't combine the extra seat with my wife's original seat and said they could cancel our flights AS THEY PLEASE AT ANY MOMENT because of duplicate tickets in our name rather than just fixing their error for it to say it was an extra seat. Well guess what, we are calling you out again for being THE WORST AIRLINE COMPANY AROUND!!! YOU SUCK AMERICAN AIRLINES!!!!!!!!!"
704,"Flying with American Airlines has been an absolute nightmare. I will never again in my life fly with American. The customer service is horrid from the start. Our flights were changed multiple times. I have paid multiple times to pick seats and have never sat in the seats I paid for because American Airlines keeps changing my seats. I had a seat and an extra seat and at one point today I had a seat on one flight with my extra seat on a totally separate flight. They can't seem to figure it out. I want refunded for all those seats I paid for and never sat in!!! Our connecting flights were even changed while we were flying to that airport and we weren't told until we arrived at the airport. Along with that, I needed to use the disabled cart services. The guys running the carts were standing around talking to each other instead of getting me to my gate and they tried to close the doors on me. The lady at the gate told me I should have been faster if I wanted on the flight! WHILE HAVING A DISABILITY THAT MAKES IT HARD TO WALK. SHE KEPT TELLING ME TO WALK FASTER TO THE PLANE WHEN I PHYSICALLY COULDNT!!! She was so disrespectful and rude. They tried not to honor my extra seat on the last flight out to Sacramento from Dallas Fort Worth. So many of our flights have been cancelled and rescheduled with little to no notice to get us onto the flights in time. The staff has been so rude and unhelpful during this entire time of flying to my destination and flying home. When I arrived to Sacramento, I requested a wheelchair because of my physical disabilities and I was told NO by American Airlines flight attendants because I didn't use one in Dallas. Uh no, I was on the disability cart in Dallas to get to my terminal faster (which the people in my group who walked beat us there because the guys driving the carts were standing around talking as we waited for them to stop socializing so we could get to our gates). So I was denied wheelchair use while having a physical disability by American Airlines. American Airlines is a JOKE. Do not waste your money on these people. Fly with Delta, Southwest or United who seem to have better customer service skills and who will actually help you and fix their mistakes rather than blaming the customer for the error because American will not own up to their mistakes that they made! They are TRASH. When we first made our reservations I had to call them out on Twitter to get them to own up to their error because they wouldn't combine my extra seat with my original seat and said they could cancel our flights AS THEY PLEASE AT ANY MOMENT because of duplicate tickets in my name rather than just fixing their error for it to say it was an extra seat. Well guess what, I am calling you out again for being THE WORST AIRLINE COMPANY AROUND!!!"
705,"On 24 October 2020 I was a passenger on American Airlines flight 2194, seat #32C from Charlotte North Carolina to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  I was discriminated and harassed for incorrectly asking the flight attendant for a glass of water.  I asked the flight attendant ‚Äúcan I get a glass of water?‚Äù he very condescendingly told me ‚Äúis may I have a glass of water‚Äù he was very arrogant, he lacked social skills and empathy, but evidently that‚Äôs acceptable by the leadership of American Airlines, besides having no concern for social distancing and packing the aircraft."
706,Worse airline always late and delaying your fly plus no social distance practice aircraft are full to the capacity
707,"Flight delayed and then cancelled due to a thunderstorm. Unfortunate but certainly not AA's fault. However, where the experience completely fell apart was in the re-booking stage. After queuing for 1 person at a helpdesk for 2 hours, I was told I'd been booked onto a flight the next day at 6pm (currently 3pm so a good 27 hours later) as all the previous flights were full. For context, this is Orlando to Miami, there's at least 5/6/7 flights a day. I was also given a number for a hotel to call. Nothing more - to book, pay and arrange transport to and from was all up to me. Even when explaining that I had a UK phone that would block any calls made and asking if they could call from the desk on my behalf. A firm sorry sir I cant help you. I then went over to the BA helpdesk as a bit of a hail mary (as a fellow OneWorld airline who often partner with AA on these flights and with my lowest level membership). They were able to book me onto the 11am flight the next day (which was still an AA operated flight and really depressingly was no more than half full - I had two rows to myself) and assisted in calling a hotel, arranging free transport to/from and paid 50% of the cost of the hotel. Really put into context just how poor AA was."
708,"Do not Fly with this Airlines. I have certified ESA animals that they wouldn't allow me to board my flight twice to St. Maarten for school from DFW. The agents are incompetent, insensitive, racist and uncaring for those of us who have Documented Disabilities, certificates of approval from The Inspection Department of Agriculture and Ministry of Tourism to bring both of my ESA cats with me plus their veterinarian, USDA certificate, and yet they still denied me transportation not once but twice. I've experienced emotional distress, panic attacks and it has costs me over $2600 to prepare my ESA animals to fly. They lied on me say my Covid test was invalid, it was not , I need a physical exam, oh my debit card doesn't work to oh you were here last week , so he took over an hour to even put my luggage in the system. Never fly with this company, never if you want a piece of mind and treated with dignity and respect. Not lied on and to by the managers at DFW terminal C-21.  Just don't choose another airline."
709,American Airlines has deteriorated drastically especially during Covid.Keeping passengers waiting on a flight after boarding just so you can fill the flight with more passengers. And then luggage doesn‚Äôt get there because they have overpacked their flight. Disgusting AA!
710,My daughter and I flew on American appx 1week ago and the plane was packed! Every seat filled. The flight attendants were not very friendly and they barely went up and down the isles. Last month my husband and I flew on another airline to Cancun and they kept seats open in between strangers due to Covid. Also When I got to me seat after boarding there were crumbs in my seat. Obviously not cleaning well.
711,"My flight was scheduled to leave at 6:32am.  I got to the airport and hour before my flight left.  Unfortunately, forgot my phone in the car so had to call the parking shuttle to come back and pick me up to get my phone and bring me back.  They came right away, I zipped through the security line and ran to my gate.  I got to the gate at 6:18am.  The customer service lady had just shut the door after letting the last passenger through as I arrived to the gate.  I thought she would allow me to go through but unfortunately she refused.  She said I needed to be at the gate at least 15 minutes before the flight left.  I was there 14 minutes before the flight left and she just barely closed the door.  I begged for her to let me on the flight and she refused and said I was late and there was nothing she could do other than put me on stand by for the next flight.  She had no empathy for my situation and was cold and callous.  Seemed she was doing it to teach me a lesson...really?!  Ridiculous customer service.  I usually fly southwest but my company purchased this flight for me using their credit card points.  I would never fly American Airlines by choice...pathetic customer service!  Sure it was my fault for forgetting my phone...but I was there 14 minutes before my flight left, not 15 and was not able to get on my flight.   Incredible."
712,"We started out on our departure flight with a 2 hour delay due to a mechanical issue with a fuel pump. We missed our connecting flight but were able to get on another one without too much of a delay. In all we were around 2 hours late arriving at our destination. However they lost one of our 2 checked bags. We also noticed the one checked bag we did receive had black marks all over it and a liquid spilled on it. Turns out it was some form of oil. As I was reported our lost bag to the baggage claims I told the attendant about the oil on our brand new luggage. She promptly replied ""oh you never know what can show up in the baggage bins"" and would not file a damage report on the damage. In all the delays caused us to miss our dinner reservation as our bag did not show up for another few hours. I spoke with 2 different American Airline representatives over the phone 1 and 2 days later respectively and told both about our issues and not one person has said anything about our damaged luggage after both representatives said they were going to do so.  I use the word never cautiously but I'll never purchase a ticket for an American Airline flight again."
713,"I recently booked a flight to Charleston WV on the app. Once I got to Philadelphia and got to my gate I seen it was to Charleston Carolina. I straight away went to the service desk and asked what happened and why am I going to Carolina instead of West Virginia. I know I booked It correctly and they insisted that it was my fault and I had to pay an additional almost 400 to catch the next flight to Charleston WV. I had a deadline and for the app to not book properly and I showed proof of this and having to pay an additional almost 400 dollars and not get any reimbursement from the airline is unprofessional. I literally had no choice but to purchase it. My suggestion is to find the flight, call the airline if you can get through and make sure the call is recorded and they know this, by law you have to let them know. And book it. I lost almost 400 dollars and 3 hours on my job because of this glitch."
714,"I flew from Greenville, South Carolina to Columbus, Ohio. When I arrived at the Greenville airport, I was greater by Beverly. She may have been the most rude airline employee that I‚Äôve even encountered. She was very unfriendly and charged me $200 for a large bag fee. Upon the charge, Amex informed me that it was actually a $230 fee. This was the same bag that I flew to Greenville with and was not charged. Actually it‚Äôs the same standard bag that I have used for the past 2 years. I asked for the manager but I didn‚Äôt have time to wait for her as my flight was leaving soon. It seemed to me that Beverly was trying to provoke an incident with me or she was hoping that I didn‚Äôt have the additional $230. Upon my arrival to Columbus, Ohio I retrieved my bag. I then walked to the ticket counter and spoke with Gary and another female employee. My bag was standard in their eyes. I took photos and filed a complaint with AA. Waiting to hear a response but I don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôll be flying with the ever again."
715,"I am DISGUSTED that American Airlines doesn‚Äôt care one bit about COVID. They fill their planes to the brim, putting every single persons life at risk. This is now my second time flying with them during COVID where this has happened. All this airline cares about is money and greed more than human safety. Disgusting. I will never fly AA again and I will be sure to tell those I know to take another airline. Shame on you."
716,Will never fly AA worse customer service ever! Manager Nick would not listen to what I had to explain about my gate being changed without notification! Was very rude and unprofessional threatening me that I will never be able to fly American again! Told the counter lady Valerie he lives 2 blocks way from me!!
717,Never ever will travel in America airlines every time I get to travel is alway a delay on maintenance issues.two years ago when I traveled to Puerto Rico waited on the airport for about four hours and to be told that the flight was canceled due to maintenance problems.very disorganized and no social distances even the seating they were all occupied side by side.
718,My flight out of Virginia was scheduled for departure at 7:05 am. It was delayed over an hour causing me to miss my connecting flight to Tampa at .9:00am which would have arrive at 11:20am.AA put me on another flight that arrives in Tampa at 8:50 PM !!!  9 hours later!They even  refused to compensate my meals Now that I‚Äôm stuck at the airport. I. Am. NEVER. Flying. AA. Again.EVER !
719,No social distancing what so ever . Over crowded . No concern for pandemic and it‚Äôs customers.
720,"One hour time frame between landing and departure of my connecting flight in Charlotte, NC headed for charlottesville, VA.  We have to stall in the air for air traffic control before landing in Charlotte. Pilot gets on intercom and informs customers no need to worry about missing a connection flight we will be holding all departures for people on this flight. We race through the airport to get To an empty terminal. I had to pay $200 for a rental car (I chose Avis knowing that was Americans preferred partner hoping a reimbursement would be an easy breeze) and drive 6 hours home after there were no other flights. But of course nothing can be simple, I get thrown though ringer for three weeks talking to customer service to finally get an answer that there will be no reimbursement for the car and that‚Äôs the only answer I‚Äôm given. Absolute morons working at the airports letting a flight leave knowingly having customers in the air above them waiting and even worse customer service.. it‚Äôs $200 American, you‚Äôre a multi billion dollar company that still wants to steal money out of pockets of the nobodies in the world. Typical America."
721,"I have a serious respiratory medical condition. Breathing without anything over my face is difficult. Because of this I have flown without covering my face with a mask or anything else. On this particular flight I was harassed by the gate agent, the flight attendant, another flight attendant. These people stood around speaking rudely to me, ordering me to put on a mask, speaking disrespectfully, bullying me and never listening to a word I was saying . They were completely insensitive to my medical situation. When I called customer service they could not have cared less if they tried. The customer service representative was clearly reading a script. I have flown American for many years and I want to make it very clear that I will not fly them anymore ever. The unfortunate thing is that American Airlines really does not care one single bit that neither I nor any member of my family will ever fly American again. I do not even recognize the world in which we currently live. People are so rude, absolutely mean, unempathetic and have a total disregard for common courtesy, just like employees of American Airlines. God help us all!"
722,"Wow!  Kim recently helped me with a flight change, to the point that I hunted down how to send in a positive review of her service, I truly hope she hears of this message to AA.  We had a flight change that was going to have us in a 5 hour layover and not getting home until 10:30 p.m..  The issue is, we have a 2 year old and a 6 year old, so as you can image, that is not ideal for anyone.  Kim went above and beyond my expectation in getting us moved to another flight, with a very short layover and getting us home around 6 p.m..  I don't know if she'll ever know how much that meant to us.  I called and waited on hold for quite awhile and I'm so glad I did.  She resolved my concern in less than 15 minutes.  God surely put me on the phone with the best person for the job.  AA is blessed to have her on their team.  Thank you so much Kim and AA!"
723,"Not much to say from my part, I've never had a negative experience, and I travel quite often. It is my to-go company when I am trying to book a flight."
724,So disappointed in American Airlines!  Flew from DFW to Jax today and the plane was completely packed!!!even in this time of COVID. So sad! Obviously not concerned with passenger safety. üò™
725,Flew 9/9 on American from San Diego to DFW  flight #AA1611 and I wanted to give a great review of my experience with one particular flight attendant Chance beyond friendly and helpful !! I was traveling with my ESA Scribbles and when we were getting settled in my seat and  my Ear Bud got knocked out and I thought it would be forever lost. He totally helped me find it as it was lodged in the seat hardware. I'm sure its not in his job description  especially now to be so helpful !! So thank you to Chance for going out of your way !!
726,This democratic loving airline is the worst ever allowing blm  crap protest around the country are hurting Americans they are supporting this boycott non American Airlines I did and will never fly again on this sorry excuse of a so called American company you will be bankrupt soon and thank GOD for that you and your management are garbage GOD BLESS AMERICA you pile of garbage
727,"American is the WORST, their Customer services is dismal at best. They awarded me a flight coupon then denied it and never issued a ticket although the reservation remained in tact.  They then charged me an EXTRA $35 dollars to buy my ticket at the counter.  DO NOT FLY THESE THIEVING LEGAL EXTORTIONISTS. Keep my $35.00, its the last of my money you will EVER see !!!"
728,As all are experiencing flights are changing. My flights I was offered from the airline left me stranded in north Carolina as my flight to Jamaica would have left before I arrived! After dealing with customer service for two hours now having to stay overnight somewhere costing me more money with no offers. Flying first class and find out they are sending me somewhere that the lounge is closed when there were options to go other places. Clearly they are trying to push people through with no consideration of what they are doing or the money you spent on getting somewhere. Never will fly this airline again. I fly all the time and clearly a reason why I don't fly them.
729,"I purchased airline tickets to Florida for a planned Disney Cruise. But due to the pandemic, Disney Cruise cancelled and I requested a refund on American Airlines website and they IMMEDIATELY approved of the refund (instead of flight credit) for the flights. They didn't give me any hassles and I did not need to call in to fight for my refund (unlike other airlines). I had to call NUMEROUS times and write letters to the other airlines for similar situations and the other airlines (United and Delta) were not as accommodating as American Airlines.I greatly appreciate the honoring of the refund, even though the flight was considered ""non-refundable"". The covid19 pandemic has definitely interrupted the world and I'm happy that American Airlines are able to accommodate their clients. I will now only purchase flights from American Airlines and will tell my family and friends to do the same.Thank you so very kindly for your amazing service. It does not go unnoticed."
730,"One of worse airline ever especially during COVID 19 they don‚Äôt care about anything, no social distancing nothing, airplane fully booked just you can compare it with delta, delta is amazing , I wish I could upload photos"
731,"We had a connecting flight with a 3 he layover.   Asked an attendant where we needed to wait and were directed to gate C8.  Planes come and go and we are still waiting.  Finally a new attendant arrives and asks where we are going.  She then tells us we should have been at gate B7.  A 10 minute walk across the terminal and of course we missed our flight.  When trying to get this fixed I was told thats to bad.  And was given another flight TOMORROW.  My 3 hr layover just became 18 hrs and I've lost a day of my short vacation.   This BLACK attendant saw a white couple and actually sneered before directing us, a WHITE couple to the wrong gate.  And the BLACK worker who fixed it actually told me it was to bad.  We would just have to wait till tomorrow to get going. A missed flight a night in an airport waiting room a missed car rental.  Off to a great start American.  I will never fly American again."
732,Flew from SFO to DFW. Was very pleased with flight. Comfortable flight and process was pleasant. Upon arrival to DFW I asked two different stewardesses where baggage pickup was and was referred to AA booth in terminal. I was close to last one off plane. I stopped briefly at terminal booth to ask where to pick up luggage and was yelled by attendant to not hold up line and to go in front of I had question. I scooted to ensure no one was behind me and politely ask I just need to know where baggage is. Attendant refused while yelling for me to not talk to him from the side. I walked all way into front and snapped a picture of him for my complaint. He screamed at me to never take his picture. I walked in without arguing. He chased me down screaming that he was calling ‚ÄúDPS‚Äù on me. I said okay and kept walking. Several other passengers at this point were sharing how rudely he treated them. So here is his pic. He definitely needs some training in interpersonal skills and professional conduct.
733,I bought an booked airline tickets from American Airlines to Colorado round trip and 3 weeks before my flight i got a email from them saying there was minor changes to my flight times... didn't think much of it till I was sitting on a 4.5 hour layover in Chicago.  If the flight had that much of a layover I wouldn't have bought the tickets.  But since I already paid they sold my tickets to someone for more money an gave me the shittier tickets. Dont buy tickets from them they are not honest people.  Wasted a whole day sitting around in the airport.  Fly with a different company if you actually want what you buy an not just this BS!
734,Absolutely horrible experience. Rude staff and very poor customer service. The baggage was delayed and no one even apologized. Stay away.
735,"I booked a flight to Jamaica to bring my wife back home as she has been stuck there since March 3rd due to Covid-19. I booked us both 1st class tickets for the flights home as my wife has back issues due to a botched surgery back in 2006. I live just outside of New Orleans and we now have two Hurricanes heading for Louisiana so I needed to cancel my flights as I have now idea how much wind and flood damage our home is about to receive. I called Reservations and had to wait 40 minutes for a return call. The ""Customer Service"" Representative, Regina was non-sympathetic about our situation and would not issue a refund for the flights because American had not yet cancelled the flight scheduled for 6 AM tomorrow morning. By that time the outer bands of the hurricane will be impacting our area so the flight will not be able to depart. My only option was to receive a credit for future travel which must be used by 12/31/21 or be forfeit. What a cold, uncaring company American Airlines is for not be willing to refund customers who are affected by situations out of their control, especially during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Air travel in the US is down 70% due to Covid-19, I would imagine American Airlines business is down more than that based on how they treat their so called, ""Valued Customers"". What a joke! Do your self a favor, find another airline for your future travel. American Airlines does not deserve our business!"
736,"I am unhappy that despite speaking to a rep twice to ensure my family would be seated together, at check in we were separated. The worker at the gate could not have cared less. The airline does kit know anyone‚Äôs medical ir immune status. Given Covid they should make lite if an effort to respect requests and if not, there is no need to be rude"
737,I have never had a bad experience flying until today. Tampa to Dallas idk if the pilot was new but when he was landing he made the plane go up and down quickly making my feel so nauseous. I felt like puking. I felt his braking was rough as well the whole plane shoot more than ever. Another thing I noticed was they make you aware that masks are to be worn or you can't fly with them but on the plane the lady stewards were not wearing a mask at all walking the Eisles and speaking with people face to face?? Worst flight ever.
738,"I do not recommend American airlines for travel. American airlines canceled my flight  12 hours before I was supposed to leave and did not give me any good booking alternatives at all   I booked an economy flight taking a chance at getting a good price and I wish that I had not It ended up costing me a lot more money and ruined a very important trip.  They charge for baggage, their cancellation and refund policies are not good at all, and I really regret booking with them. This booking was an economy flight and there  just are no refunds and the choice they gave me for rebooking were not good at all. For important trip time frames try Southwest they have never let me down on any bookings and have always gotten me there on time. I recommend you look into other airlines before choosing American."
739,Never again this airline is full of dodo for one thing I paid more for my luggage then I did the trip they changed my flight already 2 times I was supposed to leave at 4 I'm still waiting something that was supposed to be a joyful trip as turned into a nightmare thanks American Airline
740,"Boarded the plane for flight AA5658 and been sitting here for 45 minutes SO FAR with absolutely no communication on why we're not moving. Maybe keep your ""valued customers"" in the loop on what the hell is going on. Yes?"
741,"Two flights two one hour plus delays. If you are the CEO and you are reading this, fire your COO. Sincerely,90% on your customers."
742,"Worst customer service! Spoke to someone who calls themselves a ""supervisor"" after an ABSURD amount of time on hold and he was the rudest person I've dealt with in a VERY LONG TIME. Talked over me, interrupted me, put me on hold for almost another 20 minutes only to come back even less helpful, HAD ME PURCHASE ANOTHER ROUNDTRIP TICKET and then implied i was stupid and a liar by saying that's not what he said to do, and that what i was telling him i did i infact did NOT do ( even though he wouldnt shut up long enough to even listen to what i was saying) and then had the delight of speaking with this lady from ""customer relations"" who also was very rude, interrupting and talking over me, and didn't even have the hole story (even though it was written to her in TWO emails and i was TRYING to explain it to her on the phone) but, all this airline cares about is $ signs, that's why their employees treat customers the way they do, and upper management does absolutely nothing. Imagine prepaying for a service at lets say a dental office, and then you reschedule that service for a diff day, and then you want to cancel that appointment as well because you no longer want to have your treatment at said dental office because they've treated you so poorly, now imagine that dental office says sorry we cant refund your pre payment- you have to use the credit in our office or pay out of pocket again to go to another office! How crazy it is that we allow an airline with such poor quality and customer service, (ranked last the last 3 yrs in a row!!)do this to thousands of customers!!  #boycottamericanairlines"
743,"Dear American AirlinesAmerican Airlines flight from Charlotte NC to MKE flight 5422 8 pm July 31, 2020. I was not able to sit in the seat without having a very large person touching me. This person should have been made to buy two seats.  I took a photo but I am afraid it does not accurately show the man‚Äôs size ( he was 350 pounds plus) - to give you an idea: he had to lean into the aisle the whole flight so as not to smother me.  The gate people changed my seat assignment Just before the flight. I booked a seat on a very large plane, your company made the decision to change the plane to a CRJ900A (a small plane two across) . I imagine the goal was to pack the airplane during this pandemic. Before the flight - the crew made an announcement that, If anyone would like to change their seat assignment because of social distancing push the call button and the attendant will find you another seat. So when I pushed by button the flight attendant  Brabara  came. I asked to change seats  because distancing was impossible and she said all seats are taken. I said they made an announcement about social distancing and I need to change seats. To that she said ‚ÄúOh they have to say that, there are no available seats.‚Äù I said but, they just said it now? She had A very curt manner and said there is nothing Left except my jump Seat.  The she turned off my call button and retreated.Jamming people together and then making an announcement about being Concerned for passenger safety is apparently all lies. After the flight I waited for everyone to exit the plane, and then I asked the flight attendant her name. She just stared at me. I again asked for her name. She said, ""It was a short flight"". I asked, are you going to tell me your name? And she finally said Barbara. I sent AA this letter, and I will summarize their response...Summary of the American Airlines response to my complaint: some people are big and we are sorry about that. And we are also sorry you were uncomfortable. We will put it in the database. Please fly with us again. lol Not a word about their lying announcement during the pandemic."
744,AMERICAN ONLINE IS THEE WORST airline EVER and Manager Marion in Charlotte does not deserve her title very rude and poor customer service I waited literally 3 hours at the gate my ticket and monitor stated only to be told the flight was changed to another gate and I missed it I will not rely on them to fly a dead body these people are theeeee WORST
745,"I had and continue to have the most shocking experience with American Airlines.I live in London and in May 2020 contacted American Airlines to purchase a round trip ticket for my disabled friend who lives in Los Angels (L.A to London RTN) I clearly stated to the gentlemen my friend is disabled and travelling with 2 small support dogs and that I needed to confirm that AA accommodated this. I was informed yes they do and then told the travel requirements for the dog carrier in order to fly with them. I purchased the ticket which was emailed to me and I forwarded to my friend. On the day of flight she arrived to be informed that the carrier flight was British Airways who accosted her on flight and physically removed her from the flight stating that A.A had not notified them of the support dogs travelling and therefore she was physically and aggressively pushed of the flight by one of the flight attendants. Abandoned and left in the middle of the airport alone, DURING  a pandemic, in trauma and with her 2 support dogs, a gentlemen who saw she was in trouble and crying assisted her. Taking her to another member of staff for B.A who took her into a room and rebooked a flight for her in 2 weeks time. She was then left in the road at the airport in the middle of the pandemic traumatised and alone. She luckily was able to find a taxi to take her to a friends house to stay whilst awaiting her next flight.On the morning of the flight I checked all was well only to discover it had not been booked at all!. She would have found herself in the same traumatic situation!. I placed a complaint with B.A who refused to acknowledge the complaint and their disgraceful behaviour toward a vulnerable person,  and with A.A via their website which is the only way to contact their customer relations team. I received an email acknowledging the email sent to them and stating they would get back to me within 8 working days. This never happened. Despite contacting over the months various AA departments, speaking with supervisors etc I continue to be told I need to go through their customer relations team which has no number for contact only an email on their website which they do not reply too! I requested a refund and continued to be ignored. I eventually booked another flight for my friend with AA L.A to Amsterdam return with a ticket credited but that cost 500.00 gbp less. I have since been trying to get a refund for the remaining amount due to no success. I'm constantly send in circles only to always be redirected to customer relations which no one responds too. I was then sent a voucher which I had not requested from AA in the US which arrived in my friends name! I could not use it even if I wanted to as it was issued to my friend who was now in Amsterdam..Following many calls again to request the money be refunded back to me as the payee I have to date got no where :-) .So my friend is completely traumatised by the experience and now refuses to fly again. I'm 500.00 out of pocket as AA continue to keep my money and refuse a refund even after understanding the horrific experience they put my friend in, taking no responsibility even though it's a federal crime to treat a vulnerable person (with a U.S gov certified disability card) in the manner in which they did as they have a legal responsibility for their welfare and care as a customer. 500.00gbp out of pocket, no one taking responsibility, being directed to a non existent Customer relations Team of AA and B.A ignoring the complaint.BE WARNED - if you're vulnerable you're open to being abused by both airlines, and if you purchase a ticket you wont get you money back.THE most horrific shocking experience!!!My only route now is complaints to aviation authorities,legal services and  Federal authorities and warning others via social media platforms."
746,I had a bad experience with American Airlines. I had purchased two tickets for them but they are afraid to come because of the virus and the Airline refused to accommodate in any way and the manager came close to tell me go F yourself. Bad customer service.
747,SOCIAL DISTANCE WHERE ??? THIS IS WORST AIRLINE EVER! I CANT BELIEVE THEY PUT US ALL ON A FULL FLIGHT. EVERY SEAT ON THAT PLANE WAS OCCUPIED.
748,We had an absolutely terrible experience recently with American airlines. We departed from Savannah Georgia in route to Puerto Vallarta. we nearly missed the connection in Dallas-Fort Worth because the plane was late. Additionally we felt like the service was mediocre at the gates and on the plane. Conversely on our way back the plane was an hour late leaving Puerto Vallarta we nearly missed our connection in Dallas-Fort Worth. Additionally my wife's large checked bag did not make it home with us it's coming in today which is a day later. trying to get American airlines persons to assist was a near impossibility. As week wearing numerous American airlines associates with walkie talkies excetera all we got was the deer in the headlights look. Honestly if you have another airline you could fly do it. Will be heading back to Delta
749,"Horrible experience, I cancelled my flight for my family to sxm within 24hrs due to covid19..a month later still pending"
750,"Travel has become a nightmare. AA has always been alright, but I recently felt like cargo being thrown into the plane. The airlines need to remember they are still a people business."
751,"I used a ticket from a trip that was cancelled due to COVID.  My father, who lived in Vegas, was on his deathbed in a hospice center. I used this ticket to immediately travel to Vegas.  Two days after my arrival, I decided to extend my trip as my father's health continued to deteriorate.  Despite my requests and escalation to a supervisor, I was charged several hundred dollars more and not provided a refund.  I once again needed to change my return flight and was then told I would receive a voucher for the credit difference.  What I needed was the money, as I was ill able to afford this trip.  In my utmost personal time of need, American Airlines once again proved that profit over people is their end game.  I will be posting this to Google and Yelp."
752,"American Airlines blamed COVID for delaying a flight 4+ hours (MLB to CLT to MHT) so they could fill the next plane from MCO (CLT to MHT)!  They blamed COVID but they should  have blamed themselves for greed of filling their plane to full capacity.  My other recent flying experience (MCO to MHT) was completely different!  All middle row seats were intentionally left open, and all flights were not full.  Thank you Southwest for actually caring about your customers and employees!  I will never fly American Airlines again!"
753,Wow couldn't believe AA. I will never fly with them again. Leaving Miami flights full NO SOCIAL DISTANCING GETTING ON THE PLANE. People up your A- -. What i was surprised is when they have the people in first class go first. I know they pay more but you have all those people pass them. Makes No sense. Then they start with the first isle leaving but do people listen Nope. No one there to tell these idiot's to please sit. Flights are full. Wouldn't recommend flying with them. They also in Montana left us. We still had 5 minutes before take off. Plane was still connected to the runway to get on plane. Left with our luggage. NEVER AGAIN.
754,"Flight AA130 from MSY to Dfw July 16.... great crew ... friendly pilots, attendants .  Every passenger greeted as entered the cabin... pilot made up as much time as possible .... Thx"
755,American Airlines LAX ground crew very unprofessional. !!! Bad attitude on a flight half empty !!! Shame on you AA not purchasing another trip !!
756,"GEG to ABQ via DFW, of all COVID FILLED PLACES. Flew first class and got a very small bag of graham crackers. Cost...$715. AA makes a big deal about caring for health and safety of their passengers, YET no distancing. Every seat filled on every flight. AA has a lot of advertising about their deep, thorough cleaning, YET every crevice, ledge and surface had a build up of grime, bacteria, virus, and filth. I wiped everything down with alcohol and cotton pads. Pads turned black. YET, AA threatens to ban for life any passenger not wearing a face covering. Double standard! If I contract COVID 19, It is because of AA."
757,There website doesn't work and there customer servic s is a night they don't no thete head from there arm.
758,They lost my luggage and all the flight attendants were rude planes are dirty only half of them have TVs and to top it off the pilot made a racist comment to my wife No compensation after we called the hotline about our lost luggage
759,I had an amazing experience at BNA airport. The name of the agent who assisted me is KATHY. I have to write her name in bold so that everyone can see it. This lady is phenomenal and loves her job because she went above and beyond to solve the problem that I was having. I will definitely fly with Aa airlines again because of KATHY.
760,"Flight was delayed and caused us to miss our connection. Had to fly to different airport and drive five hours to get to our final destination. Ended up having to pay over $350 for the new rental car since we never made it to our original airport. American does not care whatsoever. No apologies, no compensation, nothing.  About to fly back home and tried to move our flight up a couple hours in case they delay us again, we would have a backup option. They have seats on the earlier flight but want $200 extra for each ticket to be put on that flight. I would NEVER use this airline again. Go ahead and use this if you want to be nickel and dimed to death and end up with the worse service ever."
761,"I would rather pay extra for my plane tickets than settle for American Airlines. The first time I ever flew with AA was 2016, and I was stuck at DFW overnight with only a $20 meal voucher to feed 3 because of my flight constantly being delayed; we ended up departing from Nashville nearly 4 hours later than the original flight time. When we arrived at DFW, they refused to let us on the plane despite it not yet departing, fully aware of our flight-delay situation. Now, 4 years later, I‚Äôm sitting on a plane at DFW once again being told that our flight will take off in ‚Äú15 minutes to an hour‚Äù every 15 minutes. It is currently 7:40, our plane was supposed to leave at 6:30. We are awaiting an entirely new crew, pilot, and oxygen bottles!! Shouldn‚Äôt they have this stuff taken care of BEFORE we board?? It‚Äôs the middle of a pandemic, and they‚Äôre keeping us in a very confined space for MUCH longer than necessary. This is uncomfortable, unsafe, and they clearly do not regard the health of their customers.TL;DR: AA is cheap, but if you‚Äôre looking for reliability, consistency, and on-time flights, don‚Äôt book AA. Southwest has been far superior in every way, and I will do all I can to avoid flying with American Airlines."
762,This was the worst flight i had ever experience in my life spirit should had been better imagine getting on a plane that‚Äôs so hot u can‚Äôt breathe they mess up on the set and it was so filthy the upkeep of the plane is horrible they should be ashamed of themselves being that we are going through a world wide epidemic sad someone could had literally died honestly they should be ashamed of there brand and let‚Äôs not get into rude and unprofessional flight attendants
763,"My family took AA1115 on 07/03/20 from DFW to SFO. The flight was full even though Texas has record breaking Covid 19 cases. My daughter has a problem when she checked in her golf bag. She was instructed to take out all her belongings including golf caps and her other clothing from the golf bag because AA only allows golf clubs and golf shoe inside the golf bag. She had no problems for the past 9 years when she travelled nationwide as well as Australia and Canada flying United, Southwest, Delta, Qantas and Canadian airlines. All these airlines allow her to have her other belongings inside the golf bag as long as it is within the weight limit. Why did AA give her a hard time at check in during Covid 19 outburst? Why can they put $ over public safety with a full flight?"
764,"I booked a first class ticket for my trip in Sep.  My trip was going to depart from Miami.  My trip was cancelled/postponed and when I called American to try to get a refund, I was told I could not because they didn't cancel my flight.  I could only receive a voucher for a future flight.  Do they know where they will be next year.  Will they still be flying?  Will there be another pandemic?  You spend money on first class and you can't even get a refund.  SAD!!!!  Our tax dollars are bailing them out and they won't give refunds.  They are even flying with the middle seat still available.  They say they care about you.  They don't.  They are about their almight dollar.  They were the first airline I ever flew.  Now, I'll try to AVOID them at all costs."
765,"Waste of giving even one star but people have to know this how worse is the experience never ever book flight in american airlines, you will end up wasting your money.my jour should be 5 hrs and ended up 18 hrs and no accommodation would be provided and no they will not listen to you rude and be safe worst flight experience ever ."
766,"I highly discourage anyone from booking a flight with American Airlines. I would rate it a 0/5 if I could. My experience with them has proven to me that they are among the bottom barrel of airlines to fly through and should only be used as a last resort. Even then, it might be easier to just drive if it‚Äôs in the continental US. I had the displeasure of having the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had with an airline and a series of flights with American Airlines at the end of May-early June last year. Bottom line: it cost me $600 on top of my original ticket, half a day of PTO from my job, unprecedented inconvenience, and extreme frustration throughout my trip. The root cause for all of this is the logistical nightmare that is the American Airlines scheduling system and its customer service, or lack thereof. I would like to preface that unforeseen weather was the catalyst for everything, but it is not the issue with the weather that this review is focused on. Instead, it will be directed on how American Airlines responded to it.For my outbound flight, I was rescheduled because of a thunderstorm at my connecting city. The flight would have taken off the next day; however, due to an important family event I needed to be home that same day. While calling the help line, I was disconnected on American Airline‚Äôs end after waiting an hour, increasing my total wait time to 3 hrs. Afterward, American Airlines refused to assist with this, forcing me to spend $600 dollars on a one way flight and using half a day of PTO to make that flight. I flew through Delta, no problems. As an aside, every interaction I had with American Airlines‚Äô customer service was with an incredibly rude and/or demeaning agent.For my return flight, I was delayed because of weather again at my connecting city. American Airlines rescheduled me for a flight out the next day; however, there was another flight with available seats leaving later that night (I checked this while in the air). When I was able to get a hold of someone to reschedule this mishap, that flight no longer had any seats available. This is the first highlight of American Airlines‚Äô terrible logistical system. The second highlight involves the flight handling, that would delay multiple inbound landing in a weather watch location, while still allowing almost all outgoing flights to take off on time.  Finally, when I went to the help desk to schedule lodging, I was informed that American Airlines corporate has stated that they would not comp or book my (or anyone else‚Äôs) hotel stay that night and they ‚Äúare not responsible for leaving me stranded.‚Äù This is the first time I have had an experience where I had missed a flight because of delay where no obligation or responsibility was taken by the airline. The hotel would have costed me a few hundred dollars, but I opted to not take another financial hit and slept at the airport instead.This has never happened with Delta, Jetblue, Southwest, or any other airline I‚Äôve had a flight with.My interactions with American Airlines has made me choose to never book with them again. My experience is reminiscent of another large and abhorrent American corporation, Comcast. Luckily, unlike big cable, I have the option to not choose American Airlines."
767,"Worst flying experience of my life!! Covid or no convid, the passenger next to me dumped her throw up bag on my seat 20 minutes into a 2 hr and 20 minute flight. The male flight attendants handed me napkins with alcohol on them to ""clean up,"" I scrubbed my leggings with soap and water to try to get as clean as possible, praying I didn't get sick. Afterwards found out there is no blankets even in first class so I had to sit on napkins with wet pants the rest of my flight. Americans response ""sorry I didn't make it to the restroom quick enough, and we're flying at 85% capacity, hope your next flight is better"" no refund for my checked bags, no miles back, no voucher. What a trash of a company, hopefully you are one of the airlines that goes under, because you definitely don't care about your passengers."
768,"American Airlines is running a ""You can modify or change your reservation without change fees"" campaign. However, a modification or a change is going to cost you in that America Airlines will claim that the new flight has a higher cost than your originally booked flight.I changed a return flight from New Orleans to Philadelphia that was on Friday to Thursday (same flight). The flight on Thursday was half empty, so it would have cost nothing for American Airlines to move my flight from Friday to Thursday. Also, the flight being half full indicates that the price of the flight on Thursday was likely not higher than the flight I booked on Friday. Nonetheless, American Airlines decided to charge additional $222 for the change.Another layer to this is that my direct flight from Philadelphia to New Orleans was canceled by American Airlines 3 hours before the flight. I had to scramble to adjust my schedule and flight on the morning of the flight. American Airlines changed my flight to a one-stop flight through Dallas. This is during Covid-19 outbreak so I specifically booked a direct flight to avoid being in additional airports and planes. I compared direct flight versus one-stop flights from Philadelphia to New Orleans. A direct flight typically costs twice that of a one-stop flight. When I requested a refund for the change made by American Airlines, it was denied.So if a customer makes a change, the customer pays more.If American Airlines makes a change, the customer gets less."
769,"For sales agent Jay employee #679809He was excellent, went the extra mile, made my day with his determined, all-option flight checking for me at a very frightening time. I‚Äôm trying to get to Munich for the birth of my daughter. Jay helped me lock in a great option to get there. And with grace and care and attention to detail. I‚Äôll spare u the complicated details. Jay was excellent in every way. Thank you American Airlines for hiring him. And thank u Jay for your excellent service. S. Henry AA adv. #6Y4BL58"
770,"We purchased tickets through American Airlines for flights for an October, 2020 Oceania cruise, and also purchased Allianz travel insurance through American Airlines.  After Oceania cancelled the cruise due to the coronavirus we tried to get reimbursed for the unusable airline tickets, but American Airlines said that they do not cover cancellations past September 30.  I called Allianz flight insurance and they said they do not cover any coronavirus-related cancellations."
771,This company refuses to give refunds on flights scheduled during a global pandemic!  Criminal!
772,"This airline almost left my minor son in Dallas for two days. He was a few minutes late for his flight from San Jose to Dallas, so they thought they'd punish him by putting him on ""stand-by"" in another city! Not even the same one. I paid for that flight and he was there! I called three customer service people, one was a very sassy man. There were no flights out for the next two days and they wanted to put him on a flight somewhere else and charge me for it! The kicker?! The flight wasn't even full!  They were just doing it to be spiteful. What would we have done with my son stuck in Dallas for two days?! He's not old enough to rent a hotel room. They would have made a  MINOR sleep at the airport for TWO DAYS?!!! I'm so angry and, as you might have guessed, they lost my business forever. I can't believe the irresponsibility. Unacceptable."
773,"One Star is TOO MANY. This company is an embarrassment to the exceptional pilots that have worn their emblem. I am STILL on the tarmac after an hout delay!!! Anyone reading this PLEASE understand they have kept us cooped up, no air, Covid-19 is floating about while the Captain plays computer games and the co-pilot watches porn. Do NOT FLY AMERICAN!! THEY SUCK"
774,"We have flown with American Airlines in the past and found them to be very friendly and professional. We had booked again, through Netflights, to fly to Orlando on 4th May 2020 but unfortunately, due to the Corona virus our flight was cancelled.  We had also paid, directly with American Airlines, to upgrade our seats. After filling in some details on one form for the seats with American Airlines and one form for the flights with Netflights we recieved our refunds in full. 8 days for the seats and about 16 days for the flights. Excellent service from both companies. Thank you and I wish all your staff the very best in these difficult and trying times."
775,In my experience AA is ALWAYS staffed with superior cabin crews!  They are competent and caring.  They are capable and empowered.  I fly American because they are consistently SUPERIOR crews with good aircraft!
776,"SDF to DFW was delayed because the plane struck a bird on arrival.This caused me and my girlfriend to miss our connection to PDX. They made up for this by booking us a flight to Pheonix. No connections, just a flight to Pheonix. I can only hope they intended to purchase a complimentary house in our name.After reaching out to customer service, we were told the only way we could travel home together was if we stayed overnight and took the first American Airlines flight to LAX, and then they booked us an Alaskan Airlines ticket to PDX from there.We made it to LAX, but got rejected at boarding for our flight to PDX because I was given a boarding pass with no actual ticket. After LAX staff sent me all over the place not knowing where their own airlines were, American assigned us another Alaskan flight, for 8 hours out. At the time of writing, I'm still waiting.We had to stay overnight at a hotel in Dallas, and now we have to spend our day waiting in LAX for a flight. LAX customer service didn't even provide any kind of compensation, you'd think such a monumental waste of time and patience would warrant at least some money back.Next time, I'll book Alaskan. God help anybody who dares book American."
777,"Inconsistent in their checking in of passengers carrying firearms - did not actually check it, did not secure it and at destination threw the bag in with the regular baggage even though it was tagged. Leaving destination going home made us unload and throw away $50 of ammunition that was secured per the website instructions.....not safe procedure and costly to passengers who are trying to adhere to restrictions"
778,"Although I didn't get to fly with american airlines because I couldn't make the trip due to COVID19, when I called their hotline, I got through almost instantly. The call center agent was friendly and guided me through their refund process which I was able to rely on because the original flight was cancelled and I was rebooked on a flight with more than 60 minutes of departure time difference. After only 9 days, my refund was approved and I got my money back 2-3 days later. Excellent service, european airlines should take note."
779,"I am a Chilean student living in the UK. I got a ticket from London to Santiago with a connection in Miami (MIA). At the airport, I was not allowed to travel because of US restrictions.The main problem with this is that I called American airlines several times (before and after buying the ticket) and during the calls, I asked if connecting through the US was possible, and every time they said there should be no problem, they said they checked in the computers.Later I had to stay in a hotel near the airport, as I was left with no solution and on my own at Heathrow. I thought this would be temporary, but the next flight to Santiago was 2 weeks later, so I had to pay ¬£800 more than expected.I asked for a refund of the ¬£1123.00 the ticket cost to me in order to cover the hotel and food expenses, but they said this was not possible as my ticket was not refundable, but that I could use the value of the ticket with the company. I am not interested in travelling with American at any time soon, but the money would be more useful as now I and my family are struggling monetarily because of this.I do not get why they sold me the ticket in the first place, as it was known I could not travel. I know the countries‚Äô restrictions are very confusing, but that is why I asked, as an airline, they deal with this every day.I feel like I was lied to so they could get money from me."
780,"I hope to never have to fly on this airline again. American airlines is the worst. Forced everyone to wear masks, but then pack us in like sardines, what's the point of the masks when there is no social distancing here? Flight attendants too lazy to serve even a drop of water on the flight, just awful service. I paid extra to fly Delta on the way back and it was a completely different experience. They left middle seats vacant! And served snacks and water during a mere one hour flight!! You really need to take a lesson from Delta, American airlines on how to treat people properly. You have lost my business."
781,This is the worst airline. Very unprofessional and worst customer service I ever experienced! I will not be flying them ever again.
782,"Actually I would not even give 1 star. Good for you Ellie on getting your full refund.  I was promised a refund but only got credit.When I called American I asked about the seating arrangement, as I know someone who just flew with American and American is sitting 6 across.  I was told by the reservation that American needs to make up for lost revenue.Senators estimate airlines sitting on 10 billions of travelers money in the form of future travel credits issued during covid-19 Is the airline playing hard ball with the consumers?E Smith"
783,"So I have had bad experiences with AA in the past, which is why I went with 4 stars.  However, when I had to cancel my flight due to COVID-19, the woman on the phone was friendly and efficient.  I did not have to wait on hold, as they provided callback service.  30 minutes later, I was contacted.  After a ten minute phone call, my refund was processing, and after four days I had a full refund.  Every other company I am trying to get a refund with is being sketchy and giving me the runaround, so I really appreciated how easy it was with AA."
784,"Daughter had a flight from LAX to DFW... got there at 330am told to sit till 4:30 then told she needed a soft shell pet carrier AFTER WE CALLED AND WAS TOLD HARD SHELL WAS OK... ALL ATTENDANTS  WERE RUDE... THANK GOD FOR ALASKA AIRLINES who sold her a carrier. THEN. they didn‚Äôt want to let her on the flight WITH A HOUR BEFORE DEPARTURE. GET TO DALLAS... y‚Äôall know folk connecting flights and Dallas is a nightmare... WHY NOT RADIO AHEAD TO HELP PEOPLE MAKE THEIR FLIGHTS... she missed her flight to JAN... waited four hours... witnessed racial discrimination where a attendant wouldn‚Äôt allow a black couple to board ;told it was too late( A WHITE COUPLE CAME ALONG (doors flung open) WHEN WITNESSED THE BLACK COUPLE COMPLAINED... the Heffer‚Äôs story changed then AND ONLY THEN... and allowed them on.... IVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME TYPE OF NONSENSE WITH THIS AIRLINE... including a attendant throwing a bag of peanuts on a seat next to me  instead of handing them to me as I reached for them. AMERICAN AIRLINES YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE PREJUDICE, RUDE, EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE..."
785,I took a flight from Miami Oh my the flight personal Arlene was very rude and disrespectful. Did not want to give me her name and was so rude first thing in the Morning. I will never fly America Airlines again.
786,"Flight overcrowded, attendant Did not wear a mask"
787,"As I sit here writing this my wife is on the second leg of a cross country trip that she had to make to help with grandchildren while our daughter gets hospitalized. We were notified a week ago that the flight she originally booked was too full and would she mind changing to a less full flight the next day so they can accommodate for this Corona virus seating. Well she got on the 1st part from Newark to Charlotte and this flight was completely fully booked without any separation and people shoved in like sardines. They told us that they are leaving middle seats and the first two and last two rows unoccupied to give people space. Never happened. They tried to make my wife sit in a middle seat and after quite a bit of back and forth was able to get an aisle seat. Second part of trip from Charlotte to Dallas is pretty much the same except this time they wouldn't even look to change any seats. Just spoke with her as she boarded and they then told her to take an aisle seat but someone came along and they gave that person the seat also. Two people assigned to same seat just to shut ya up and get you in the plane. Again a almost full flight but the flight attendant now put her in an aisle seat after she refused to sit in a middle seat with people crowded together. They just keep LYING to people and shuffle then onboard telling everyone that the flight attendants will accommodate everyone. Flights are still way overbooked for the pandemic. There is no space at all between people. Stay away from American Airlines. They LIE and tell people they are leaving seats empty due to the virus. And to think she still has a 3rd part of this trip from Dallas to Monterey. Guessing that all the airlines are now a bunch of miss information lying workers. The airlines should be held to the same standards as restaurant, churches, and everywhere else, 6 feet apart."
788,"American was super quick to cancel my flight due to COVID-19. I was supposed to fly out of the country and the country's borders were closed on the date of my flight. I called, signed up for AA to call me back, and then I got the call. The customer service rep was super kind and empathetic and gave me a full refund to my credit card.I asked in what scenarios I wouldn't get a full refund. They stated that as long as you called before the 59-minute mark before the flight, you would be eligible for a refund."
789,Not happy at all!  With everything happening and not offering refunds is not good business...
790,"Just flew West Palm Beach to Chicago and was extremely disappointed in Americans adaptation to covid-19 pandemic. Many people on plane not wearing masks three people within six feet of me with no masks, one coughing repeatedly and became hostile when I asked him to cover his mouth. Nothing mentioned during check-in or flight about adaptation to covid-19. No request to use face mask, no sanitizing wipes, no hand sanitizer, no request to maintain social distance. When plane passengers deplaned they were right next to each other breathing heavily on other people. Not safe for senior citizens like myself. American has adapted less to the covid-19 epidemic then Walgreens, Publix Super Market, Home Depot, or Lowe's who all request customers to make changes follow rules, and be careful. American must do much much better if they want to make the public feel safe about flying again. Next time I will choose Delta instead of American."
791,"First time using American airlines. Really disappointed and definitely keep using United. They called me to notify me that my flight was cancelled, I asked for a refund to buy another flight but they said that I have to wait 14 days for the money back no cares I need the money to buy another flight in mediately"
792,"I am disgusted by the service I received for this trip. I booked off of Justfly 3rd party booking, I paid for my seat do to my shoulder disability restrictions I needed to be with my left shoulder toward the window. A day before my flight it showed I no longer had a seat reserved I called Justfly who said I needed to call Finnair who then said I needed to call justly and then of course directed to American Airlines where I asked why I was told if you don‚Äôt book direct it is only a request not a guarantee. (Who pays for a request? And why was this never advised?). So I had to get a seat once again. I arrived to the airport after a 4 hour drive which got cancelled less than 3 hours before take off due to weather. I called AA who insisted they could not rebook me I would have to call Justfly or Finnair and called both whom directed back to AA I repeated this cycle 3+ times before AA finally put me on a flight the following day. I had to pay for a hotel for the night as well as transportation because I did not live there and I was dropped off for my flight. I got put on a packed flight and of course had to pay for ANOTHER seat which did not accommodate my seating needs. I was miserable the whole flight in horrible pain due to my shoulder, I have to lean into the window and could not do so because I got put in a right side window seat. When I rebooked I was advised to call after I get to my destination and request a partial to full refund so that is what I did, of course again no one wanted to speak to me I was just referred in circles again between justly, Finnair and American Airlines. I do not feel Finnair honestly could help me in anyway however Justly and AA chose not to I ended up asking to talk to a manager when calling AA. A gentleman got on the phone and overtasked me, would not listen and his response was ‚Äúif you have the a problem call the weather station and complain not us‚Äù I asked for his name and in return he hung up in my face. I then moved on to chat so I could track just how badly the service was between all parties. I have never felt so undervalued by a business I give a lot of money to in my life. Out of all the people I spoke with not one even showed the littlest bit of WANTING to help me or understand my frustrations."
793,"I am due to fly first class in June and AA has reduced the customer flying experience to nothing.  They require me to wear a mask throughout the flights, offer no First Class meal, treatment and refuse to refund my ticket.  Why are they keeping my money when First Class no longer exists?   I have saved for this trip for a year and all they can say is they will waive the change fee on a future AA flight!  My reunion is in June!  I am a Veteran of the USAF and a senior citizen on a fixed income.  I have made 3 requests for them to refund my money to no avail.  Don't book on American, they don't care about you or your situation.  I know they have refunded peoples money, but not mine!"
794,They are refusing to give me a refund when their flights were canceled due to covid. Terrible customer service during this difficult time. Do the right thing!
795,"Excellent CS for Gold and Platinum desk, but the quality of front line employees has deteriorated significantly in the 40 years I've been flying. Many are self-serving, disrespectful, arrogant and have no business working with the public. There are some wonderful, helpful personnel, too, but they are fewer...Their website is the worst. More errors and down time than any other website I use, but unless you want to wait for an hour on the phone and pay  a booking fee, you have no choice. I just spent 45 minutes find the best fare for a very complicated multi stop trip only to have it disappear when I went to pay. For this reason I'll book at Expedia or Orbits going forward...To end on a good note, their flights are uneventful and feel safe."
796,Well when I made my reservation I was told nobody was siting next to me because the airline are doing social distancing. When waiting to board the plane you could hear them making announcements to please social distance while waiting to board. Well a kind of funny thing happened the truth about American Airlines sure showed up. We care only about money we don't care if you get sick and die. You see the resivations department says one thing to make you feel good. Than you pay and boom they pack you into the plane and they make sure no seats are open. DONT USE THEM!!!!!!! LETS USE SOCIAL DISTANCING AGAINST THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
797,My destination closed its borders.  American Airlines would not refund my ticket.American Airlines please refund my ticket.
798,"I like travelling. I fly to different countries every year. I tried many different airlines. American Airlines is my number one so far for two reasons; great customer support and amazing membership awards.  I fly to States almost every other month, and I choose American Airlines every time. I honestly sometimes choose them among cheaper options for the same trip. I know whenever I need help with my booking, they are so easy to reach and they come up with a solution. They are very flexible with bookings especially in these difficult lockdown days. I have never seen any company offers the same service during Covid 19. I would recommend everyone to use AMERICAN AIRLINES and take advantages of rewards and miles."
799,Cancelled my flight and now refusing to comply with the law and provide a refund for the flight costs.
800,"I have experienced with them, i flew from JFK to PHX (6 hours flight) and they gave me only cola üíîüíî also they never fly on time."
801,I had my trip from phl to paris cancelled due to Covid 19 and the airline was able to issue a 100% refund without a single dime fee. Thank you American airlines.
802,"I was also denied a refund for $1800 worth of tickets to FL during spring break in March. The trip was cancelled due to the Covid-19 virus. Refunding using credit toward future flights is wrong when there will be no possibility of rescheduling another spring break trip like this. I would not recommend this airline and will never, ever book with them in the future."
803,"Like so many others I had to cancel my flight reservations due to the Covid19 Pandemic. I was scheduled to fly with American Airlines on April 3,2020. My home state has a stay at home policy and the state where I was traveling does too. So obviously I had to cancel. I spent a total of $1771 in airfare and all they are giving me is a reschedule by December 2020 policy. Which probably will amount to a loss for me given the unfair expiration date. There is a lot involved for me to reschedule this trip. For one no one knows when it will be safe to travel again and when it is there are other obstacles. Like my kids needing to go back to school, and recovering from the total loss of income. My friend was flying the same day as me (April 3rd) but flying with Southwest Airlines. They gave him till June 2021 to reschedule. Which is more than a year past his original travel date. That's a little more reasonable. This end of the year policy with American Airlines is BS!!! Oh and I should add the other part of their policy is If the new ticket is less expensive than the original, any remaining amount may be forfeited. They should be ashamed to call themselves AMERICAN!  They are doing nothing for the American people at this unimaginable time. Oh and remember they will be getting a GOVERNMENT BAILOUT. So then you can say they are double dipping by not giving us a refund.The least they could do is offer us more time to use what we paid for.  Better yet how about a credit that never expires and works like cash so we don‚Äôt lose any of it."
804,"I have a ticket with American Airlines nr 0012364210166 from Buenos Aires to Hamburg 26th of April. Due to the corona and uncertainty about flights I went to the AA office 16th of March in Buenos Aires. They said they did not fly until 26th of May and I could get my money back, if my embassy found another flight. They said I should wait and see a couple of weeks, because situation could change. But it got worse and I contacted my embassy, who found a flight 1 april. Everything was closed, because of quarantine. I could not contact AA, unless I had a flight with them within 3 days. Back in Europe I look at the website and my flight does not exist. I have not received any emails and no.phone calls. There is no email to write to. I now want to phone to get my refund, but they will not receive phone calls from my prepaid phone and my subscription phone from Buenos Aires does not work here. Because of corona I do not want to use friends phone."
805,"I had a meeting with a federal agency in DC on March 10.  The US Government Cancelled the meeting due to the Covid19 crisis.    The Airline knows where to go in DC when they want Billions of Dollars from the US Tax Payers, but when it comes to refunding money to their loyal customers due to a global crisis, they rely on their rules. I realize that this crisis is not the fault of AmericanAirlines, but it is not my fault either.  If they want to keep customers, especially someone who has flown them for 30 years, they should make the refunds."
806,I got through to Customer service within 10 minutes...I was shocked. The first lady couldn't hear me and hung up on me. The 2nd was a guy (unfortunately didn't catch his name) walked me through each step even waiting for my phone service to improve. He got me all 4 refunds for my cancelled return flights online. Just received email that my card will be credited. Really thankful as I really did need this money right now! Thank you AA
807,I cancelled my trip do to COVID-19 and WAS DENIED A REFUND. How am I denied a refund for a canceling a trip during this difficult time ?!
808,"Absolutely outrageous: AA cancelled half of our flight, but retained the short haul and refuses to cancel (2 phone calls) as it was booked through the agency. Agency switched off the phones since beginning of March and doesn't respond emails. Who paid the tickets? US, not the agency! It is my money! It would be me and my family flying, not the agency!!! Yet, AA refuses to talk to us, expecting that we will make no show for the remaining part of the flight and will joyfully cash out the whole amount (4K usd)."
809,I had a one way trip for April 10 that got cancelled. I went back online to look at the flights that was available for round trip May 18-25. The calculation showed that I could get the round trip price for the same price the one way trip was for. When I spoke with the agent she told me that was an online price and I could get that price. So i asked the agent how can I go online n book it and use my credit. She told me I couldn‚Äôt it had to be booked through an agent since it‚Äôs a rescheduled. Then the one way ticket that she booked was less than what my original ticket was but she still charged me the regular ticket price.  I will never fly with American Airlines. This will be my last!!  I will only fly with DELTA!!!!!
810,"Had a trip planned to Cancun starting May 4, 2020.  I called twice to cancel due to the Corona virus. Both phone calls went the same way. The Hilton Resort we booked with closed the whole month of May 2020 due to the virus and graciously moved our week to May 2021.  That is what you would expect from a reputable business.  But American Airlines would not grant us a refund  or even give us a voucher that could be used for next year.   I asked to speak with a supervisor but was told they were instructed not to do that.  I was told that if I canceled my booking, and the flight was not cancelled by AA, then that was my personal choice and then no refund....it does not matter that the resort had closed.  I countered that the Hilton graciously had moved our week to next year.  I was told that was Hilton....they were the airline.   WOW !!!!   I will never fly AA again.  Both phone calls went that way"
811,"If I could give them a zero, I would.  I will be writing a review of 1 star as often as I can until my issue is resolved.  Here it is - we purchased tickets in December to travel to New Orleans with friends. Then, COVID-19 happened.  Half the flights were United.  They get 4 stars.  While United would not refund our money, they did give us transferrable vouchers to use within a year.  American will not give us transferrable vouchers.  We bought all four tickets for friends who very rarely fly.  They will not use their tickets and we will be out almost $600.  I hope American goes out of business due to their horrible customer service and lack of flexibility during this challenging time for us all.  Anyone else in the same situation, please speak out, tell your friends, and never fly American again.  I know we won't."
812,"Excellent experience with American Airlines and their customer service. In critical times during COVID19 crisis, they were able to help to get me back home from Romania to US. They did their impossible to rebook my flights and ensure I will be able to return home. Very professional and understanding. I do not have enough words to thank them for what they did! Thank you so much, AA!"
813,We had gotten a warning from the State Department to return to the US at once as many countries started closing their borders due to the present health emergency.I was very happy that American Airlines was able to make the changes and get us home fast!They really handled it well !!-
814,I was due to fly with American Airlines on March 27th. It wasn't my choice but they were the only airline meeting my travel timings. Due to President Trump's ban on travelers from the UK I am not able to fly to the US which means I am not able to take the booked flight. On top of that I have been put into protective self-isolation by doctors. I contacted American Airlines to cancel the flight and straight off without asking for an explanation was refused a refund. They will not accept the president's diktat nor the medical reason. These are unprecedented and unpredictable times but people are not booking and cancelling flights for the fun of it. I desperately want to be with my family but I cannot. All other arrangements I made for this trip have been refunded but not American Airlines. They appear to not care about their passengers nor want future business.
815,American airline's worst airline. I will never fly american with my family ever again. The worst customer serice i have ever seen. I called and they said yes they would let my family change to the earlier flight but wheb we get here the three rude ladys would not let us. I tried to purchase new tickets to go on that flight they won't let me. I tried on line but it said to purchase at the airlines. I will continue to blast you at this time because it even says online on your website that you can. Only 21 people boarded that plane what is the difference. This whole cornia virus that you have on your page is a lie. I would of just paid for the new flight of 178. For my family to go earlier.
816,"American corporate greed at its finest. American Airlines has no customer service and wants to pocket as much money as they can during this pandemic. At the end of the month my foreign exchange  student manuel was supposed to go on a trip with the foreign exchange program to Washington DC. We booked a flight through Alaska Airlines to go there and a flight with American Airlines to come back. The trip was canceled obviously and Alaska Airlines was kind enough to let him transfer the $135 ticket to somebody else's name since he will not be able to use it but American Airlines decides to keep the $355 ticket and won't let him transfer it to anybody else.He is going back to Spain today so obviously he cannot use that $355 it expires at the end of the year. I hope we don't bail out companies like this. For years they have been profiting millions if not billions of dollars off of high priced tickets and crammed seating with horrible customer service and during this worldwide pandemic they aren't even willing to make exceptions because it affects their bottom line, making money.We got denied on a refund which I expected, but you would think they would be willing to credit the money and let somebody else use it the way Alaska Airlines did.Shame on companies that are using this time to take advantage of customers."
817,"They cancel the flights Montevideo Miami until December. I got Montevideo/Miami and Miami/Punta cana. They are not going to refund my wife miles on the trip Miami/punta cana, besides we are not going to use it because they don't flight anymore from Montevideo to Miami (not because I want to cancel it)."
818,"An ok flight from Miami to London Heathrow. The food was just ok, and the cabin crew a bit surely, not one of them smiled."
819,"We purchased a number of AA domestic flights  in September 2019 for a trip to the US in March 2020.  Since purchasing the flights we have had the World Health Organisation declare a global pandemic for COVID-19, President Bush has declared a National State of Emergency for the USA, Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison has declared a Level 3 Travel Ban effectively stopping all non-essential travel out of Australia.  Within the USA all NYC Broadway Shows have closed down, museums and other tourist attractions have closed down, sports venues have closed down and travel within the USA has been severely curtailed, all before we were even on the plane to America!  So we cancelled our trip on medical grounds as our GP told us because of our age and conditions that we would be stupid to travel to a high risk COVID-19 country which the US is but do you think that AA care!  No they don't!  We asked for a full refund but they refused saying that our tickets were non-refundable which was unknown to us.  This is just another example of a greedy US company fleecing people during times of extreme difficulty.  So please think twice before buying anything from this group."
820,Not even one star. I hate the baggage fees one ticket agent want to charge us over $300. Another agent charged us zero one way and back got charged $80. We had to leave our daughter snowboard at the airport because they wanted charge us an extra bag fee she was crying to lose her snowboard. They seem to make it up as they go. Fly Southwest two bags free.
821,"American Airlines staff found and returned to me a luggage strap that fell off on the jetway.And....when my first flight was delayed due to a fault in their transportation system, they proactively sent me an email allowing me to re-book the connecting flight (which I didn't need to do)"
822,They have been very professional with reaching out regarding Clovid -19 concerns.  I appreciate the updates especially before I fly.
823,"American Airlines refused a refund even though I cancelled a flight 1) more than two weeks before the flight date, and 2) people my age must avoid any possible contact with the coronavirus. I am not using their service, but American is offering only a term-limited credit.  Selfish!"
824,"Very bad customer service. Rude and not friendly. They said the care about their customer, but they only care about money. I was glad to see they provided flexibility to change flight but they customer service showed me a lot of restrictions. I am not smarter than them, but I will cancel their credit card to save money for tickets I cannot travel due to the virus."
825,i paid for extra luggage online but counter said you have to pay again..
826,"I am saddened by how far American Airlines has fallen.  Until very recently I was in the air every week.  When I began my frequent flyer adventure 15 years ago American Airlines was my favorite airline.  Over time they moved down the ladder due to comfort and cleanliness-of their aircraft and most importantly treatment of customers.  However, United always held last place in the major airlines.   American has now moved to the bottom .  I had an event canceled due to Coronavirus so I had to cancel my flight and had purchased the flight with points.  America wants to charge me $150 to restore my points because they only waive international. Really?"
827,Like pigs in a cattle car. No room to breathe. Super rude attendants who know there is nothing you can do about it. Pay extra to sit together??!!! What a con!  Never again.  I mean NEVER.  I wouldnt get back on this airline if they paid me.
828,I was on my way home when a family member died. American Airlines managed to leave early for once leaving me behind as I was transferring between flights. When I explained the situation to their customer service representative they were unwilling to figure out a replacement flight beyond stand-by or any hotel option. Trash.
829,"This week I had a flight booked and about 48hrs before travel I got very sick with some kind of flu-like illness (including a fever and severe coughing). The day before my flight I contacted American  Airlines Customer Care concerned about the idea of flying due to the potential health risks for the other passengers. I did have a Basic Economy ticket and fully understand the associated restrictions.  That said, I was very concerned about potentially exposing others on either of my two flights. I explained the situation and asked them what I should do given the circumstances.  TWO SEPARATE CUSTOMER CARE EMPLOYEES TOLD ME TO GET ON THE PLANE(S) with full knowledge of these concerns! Besides these two calls, I also spoke to a supervisor (who again told me my best option was to get on the planes) plus I sent an email as they recommended.Don't get me wrong, I'm already sick and really want to get back home, but just don't think I should be in confined space (and air) while still so sick.As I said, I respect the ticket restrictions, but in this situation I really feel that public health should always come first.Inexcusable!!!"
830,"Basic economy ticket was all the possible restrictions if you happen to make a slight mistake in your booking and do not correct within 24 hours of the booking time. This happened to me. I book my trip to multiple cities with one leg of my journey causing 12 hours of stay In Chicago airport. American airline did not accommodate me getting an earlier flight in spite of having multiple flights and seats available. I was even willing to pay a fee for it. This is the kind of restriction a basic economy ticket purchased through American airline puts upon you. They were asking me to purchase another ticket all together. My ticket was not a cheap one. It costed me over $500. It was ruthless for an airline to let multiple flights go with vacant seats but not accommodate an urgent need, not even with a fee. Every time I try to call them or approach them in person, I was told that nothing can be done since I purchased a basic economy ticket. It sounded like I paid almost nothing for this ticket. Which is not the case.I paid over $500 for a total of four hours of air time."
831,"I was coming back to Phoenix from Columbia when I was visiting family there. And I checked 2 of my bags. We had a 50m connection in Dallas Fort Worth. But our bags did not make it on the plane. We had to wait a whole day until we got our bags dropped of at our house. And they did not ring the Doorbell, they just left them there in the heart of Phoenix to be stolen. Lucky I came out to go shopping. So if American Air guarantees your bags go through the terminal quicker than you like they guaranteed us do not believe them. I will not be checking my bag on American Airlines ever again. If I could take another airline besides AA or United to Columbia Mo, I would 100% do that."
832,"They assign your seats. We purchased 4 seats. NONE OF US WERE SEATED TOGETHER. When u want to rearrange your seat, its 30$ per person. Also 30$ plus more for each additional bag. Delta will be my ONLY choice in the future"
833,I wish there was a zero. Every day they are getting worse than before. Waited 55 minutes for baggage arrival at MIami. Nobody cares to announce delays. Regardless of so many passengers and their pickups being waiting for them. A third world country has better service.
834,"chase j marley -    you are best , one line i would like to say .You are God for me ."
835,The ticket agent April at the BNIA was extremely rude and condescending when asked if I could go back with my underage daughter. The up and down look when asked ‚Äúis there anything wrong with her‚Äù? Not everything is visible. I will make sure never to fly with such a horrible company thanks to April.
836,The pilot was late flying into Charlotte NC airport today feb 14th. We arrived from Denver to Charlotte at 540pm my next flight was to Tallahassee at 550pm the plane was gone and the woman was mean and said not my problem then said take it up with customer service. I go to customer service and I didn‚Äôt even notice their was a line and this is an emergency because I‚Äôm literally stuck at this airport and have never been to Charlotte in my life. I have no idea what to do or where my bag is that I checked on. I was upset and I spoke with emotion and was raising my voice and trying to get help. The woman told me to get to the back of the line and I said it was an emergency and she said she wanted me to wait my turn. Then I got upset and said are you serious??? Your pilot got me here late and now my other flight is gone and I‚Äôm stuck here! She then got her manager who walked over it was a man. The manager called the police. 3 officers came over and this manager said I was a flight risk and he wouldn‚Äôt put me on another plane. I said excuse me what have I even done wrong? I googled the flights and there was no other flight until the morning so he lied. This woman police officer told me there was nothing she could do the manager wouldn‚Äôt even help me to locate my bag or help to fix it so I could fly out the next morning. He had his employees coming out to me yelling at me that I had to leave! I couldn‚Äôt believe it and I left I had no where to go no luggage nothing! I had to call the 800# and make sure I was booked for the morning flight and thankfully she told me she located my bag. This has been the most horrible American airline at an airport I‚Äôve ever encountered. That manager and the employees he supervises are honestly the most uncaring and the more rudest people I have ever met. I will never fly AA after I finally get home hopefully tomorrow at 7 mind you I am sitting in this airport all night long because I have nothing. I can‚Äôt even get my bag until tomorrow. Worst manager in the world at that customer service center. He was a white older man and he was a liar to the police and the thankfully the police were not buying it.
837,"Americanairlines.com has horrid customer service. Our flight from Boston was diverted and finally got to DCA 6 hours late. Customer service claimed they couldn't book us on another airline or offset our rental car or resort charges even after they told us there were no free seats to Orlando until Monday (today's Thursday). She basically told us we weren't getting there this weekend and then informs us that American's refund policy requires us to file a claim (only for the ticket process for the leg we didn't fly) online. The refund site isn't mobile friendly, so we can't even do that until we get home.Not exactly world class service."
838,"My daughter is a military member who came home on an emergency leave. Given the short notice, AA was the only airline really available. Sadly, her flight was a nightmare from check-in (rude employees, mishandling of military luggage) until she finally got home (flight delays, missed connection, etc). Too much went wrong to type on my phone, but suffice it to say NEVER AGAIN!"
839,"AA worst Airlines. flight AA3683 canceled do to weather. I get it, it happens. I go to service desk and they had rebooked me for the next morning. I asked to be moved to United flight that night. Guy says it is full. I walk away and start booking United flight on line. I have a choice of 30 seats. I get back in line for AA service counter, and now girl is saying United blocked AA from booking flight as the next girl over is telling another customer she could book them on United, but if United flight gets canceled they can‚Äôt come back to AA. Lie after lie after lie, and Management/Leadership teaches them how to lie. I get to the United counter and guy says flight is wide open and they didn‚Äôt block AA. He said AA would have to pay full fair if they moved me. I‚Äôm cutting up my AA credit card and discarding my miles I have they are just not worth it. I found a Face book group ‚ÄúAMERICAN Airline complaints‚Äù."
840,"I‚Äôm a frequent air traveler. My bags were stolen or misplaced while in the care of 2 different airlines. My original flight was with Delta airlines and due to mechanical problem with the plane we were transferred to American Airlines. Both airlines are denying responsibility. My bags have been lost and out of my Possession for over 32+ days! They are both giving me no real consideration! This is a ridiculous situation to be in by billion dollar organizations. My 2 Louis Vuitton duffel bags cost over 6,000 plus 4,000 in personal contents. Not to mention time on the phone with both airlines and going back and fourth to the airport hoping my bags have resurfaced! It‚Äôs a rumor that the airlines profit off confiscated and lost merchandise and reuse bag tags! I need someone in a real Authority capacity to look into my problem! My bags were routed from Charlotte to Memphis, then to some other destination by mistake, this was confirmed by a Delta representative! My final destination was Memphis. Both airlines are giving me conflicting alibis and basically denying responsibility passing the blame on each other! I cannot afford to help subsidize the airlines! My bags have been lost since December 27, 2019."
841,"AA Flight 305 (Miami to Seattle)I flew in 36C, there was a FAT person sitting next to me taking about 30% of my seat as well. This was 6hr flight and it was 10 times more uncomfortable than my 14hr flight to Dubai from Seattle. Also, after we arrived in Seattle we waited for 50min to park since our stall was occupied by another AA aircraft.Also, after getting off the airplane, we waited for 45min to pick up our checked in baggage. Simply, a very horrible experience."
842,"Rewards travel is horrible, really really stinks.What's the point of offering it if no one can use it or if the fees are $900 on a $1250 ticket? What's the point of offering it if the layovers are 9 hours, routed in poor ways compared to paying?Why continue to use aa when the award travel is basically useless. I used to love aa, now Every experience with you seems to be poor.Very disappointed."
843,Booked our tickets the day the route opened up to get our choice of desirable seat and paid extra for the seats! Only to find out by surprise many months later that American Airline took it upon themselves to downgrade us to the cheap seats in the back of the plane & never notify us or refund the difference. Great customer service AA-NOT!!!!! Look for another airline to fly! They obviously could care less if they are treating people fairly!
844,"American Airlines traveling to see my sister be laid to rest and the airline has provided by far the worst flying experience to date. Delayed multiple flights before cancelling hours later only to hear staff know it was cancelled but couldn‚Äôt tell passengers to avoid flooding their system. Was informed by AA staff I could go out last night if I rush to Charlotte . Drove in the weather they refuse to fly in, only to arrive 2.5 hours later and find they delayed my flight to midnight( 2 hours later) and low and behold cancelled later. Had to pay for a hotel because the best they could do at that point was 7:45 next morning, which big surprise despite clear skies - delayed . Even with delay I still missed this flight it because they messed up my boarding pass AFTER they confirmed I was good to go. Arrive at the gate sweating and in full panic attack because I‚Äôm on the verge of missing my sisters service, to be met with condescending attitudes and sarcasm after acknowledging they messed up to begin with, but ‚ÄúI should have gotten through TSA AGAIN faster‚Äù . Since the first go around was pointless with a botched boarding pass and I had to repeat. Now, after already one delay we are in line to board, but they apparently had to move the planes around because ours was in the wrong spot. Hearing this at several terminals now. I have spent a day and a half watching Delta and other airlines navigate different ports, accommodate and get their people out. American Airlines did nothing but push us around so their systems didn‚Äôt get overwhelmed before disregarding our plans. Whatever you do- choose any airline In he world besides them, especially if you have such an important event to get to, because even in tears and anxiety attack they will meet you with zero empathy and horrendous customer serious."
845,Worst customer service ever.. lost bags bumped first class flight.. Charlotte NC cannot handle the traffic..
846,"Had a injury at work tore tendons in my Hand and and fractured my finger, before the Flight I asked if their was anyway someone could help me lift my bag and put it in the over head bin. I was laughed at and an oriental lady told me I could switch seats, I told her that solves nothing I just need a ‚Äúhand‚Äù that was to much to ask... ridiculous."
847,I'm sitting in Dallas Tx at my gate.  Not a single announcement has been in English.  I'm very concerned that American airlines is not concerned about my safety.  I feel extremely threatened.  This is the United States English is the national language
848,"I booked AA flights through FlightsBird in March 2019 for a trip over Thanksgiving week.  The cost was amazing since we booked so early.  We checked in online the day before our travel and got boarding passes.  When we arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to take-off, we were informed our entire itinerary had been canceled by our travel agent one day prior - that meant no flights to OR FROM our destination - and it was Thanksgiving week.  The agent informed us that in the hours since the alleged cancellation, all our flights had been sold off to new patrons by American Airlines so....who benefitted from this mess?  AMERICAN AIRLINES.  Now the travel agency denies any responsibility and AA says there is ""plenty of documentation"" to show it was the travel agent who canceled the itinerary (but they won't produce any such documentation).  It's utter madness.  The only explanation that makes sense to me is that AMERICAN AIRLINES NEEDED THOSE SEATS, THEY OVERBOOKED OR WHATEVER, AND THEY CANCELED US BECAUSE WE WERE THE LOWEST FARE.  This was far and away the worst travel experience of my entire life."
849,"Traveling to Ecuador for a guided trip and a mechanical problem delayed my flight almost 3 hours which caused me to miss my connection and entire first day of the itinerary. American Airlines rebooked my trip with a 24 hour delay. They agent never apologized and gave me no other options. Just handed me a new boarding pass for the next day, a hotel voucher, and a $12 food voucher. The hotel was under construction and in the process of being repainted. When I emailed customer service to ask for a refund, they told me the only offer they could give me was a $100 voucher (for a $550 flight). I would not suggest flying with American Airlines. They have no concern for whether you arrive at your destination on time."
850,BEWARE!!! ADVANTAGE MILES. NEW GAME TO CHARGE $150 to change award travel. As soon as you question agent your told if you argue in the form of asking for the fee to be waived they will have to hang up on you. They take your miles or pay $$$ all while acknowledging this is a NEW fee they have never had before.
851,"Wow!! Just traveled from Des Moines, Iowa to Orenburg, Russia and back. Traveled AA / British Airways from DM to Chicago to London then Aeroflot from London to Moscow to Orenburg. No issues with Aeroflot. Could not get seat assignments on AA / British, had to pay extra just to get a seat assignment - $50!!!  Then all flights I was in Group 8 when boarding, how is this possible. I was in the last row on the plane on one flight and window seat on the others - still group 8, how does that make any sense?"
852,"The flight was fine but there was one issue- food could not be bought and the only food they were giving out had meat in it. It was a meat sandwich. I asked the air hostess if she had any vegetarian sandwiches and she said ‚Äúno, this is a generic meal. If you want vegetarian, you should buy it before the flight‚Äù. Both people sitting next to me, who eat meat, agreed with me that a generic meal should be vegetarian or that there should be a vegetarian option.

855,"If I could rate this airline a ‚Äú0‚Äù I would! They are the MOST incompetent, RUDE and very disrespectful people I‚Äôve ever encountered. They lost my bag and literally gave me the run around for over 3 hours!! I asked for a manager several times and no one seemed to be one or know where one was at. When I finally got one he was the absolute worst. I don‚Äôt grasp how a company this huge can have such a disgusting head and employees. This guy name was Adam and he was of the Arabian or Indian descent. I was already frustrated from being given the run around since I landed so when I got to him he didn‚Äôt even greet me, he had a disgusted look on his face and he was very short (as in his response). I spoke, then proceeded to explain what I needed assistance with. This guy literally cut me off mid sentence and begin talking and asking questions. I answered then proceeded once again to try and explain what I needed and guess what?! He once again interrupted as if he didn‚Äôt want to hear what I had to say. So I‚Äôm confused as to why he‚Äôs coming at me like that and I then asked him if he were going to continue to cut me off? He blatantly told me yeah, I don‚Äôt need to hear what you got to say. So now I‚Äôm pis‚Äôd because once again I‚Äôve been highly inconvenienced since I‚Äôve been here. So after that I was like what the eff and he was like oh no you‚Äôre done. I‚Äôm not helping you. You‚Äôre rude. Dude! You‚Äôve literally been a piece of ish since I‚Äôve encountered you and now that I‚Äôm confused and upset you want to say I‚Äôm being rude? Heck no. At this point I‚Äôm livid. I go back to ladies only to tell them that was a bad idea sending me to someone like him. Long story short I had to wait to get my bag THAT THEY SENT TO THE WRONG CITY, the next day. Today is that day. I received my bag and guess what?! Literally everything in it is damaged. I‚Äôm completely over them at this point and I will leave a review on every site I can. I will contact the media and if they don‚Äôt compensate me for my troubles and my property that they‚Äôve severely damaged, there‚Äôll be another lawsuit. I‚Äôm not playing!! This is horrible."
856,"Their partner in crime, Envoy Air in Abilene Texas shouldn‚Äôt be in business. They‚Äôre constantly late, causing us to miss so many connecting flights, spend hours sitting in a plane because there is no qualified staff at the airport to fix the plane‚Äôs problems so it can fly! The we spend all day at DFW because AA has to send us on a different flight that doesn‚Äôt leave until later in the day so we completely missed our vacation plans. Weather issues can be understood. This crap can not be excused!!!"
857,I was misinformed by my travel agency and the boarding flight that my children will not be able to return on me if they were not traveling outbound it regardless I contacted the airline we were flying back on Aeromexico throughout my vacation and literally spent the whole time on the phone with them trying to confirm that my tickets will be there when we got to the airport for my children to fly home needless to say they were not after I was assured they would be the supervisor from Mexico in the little office in Guadalajara was the rudest thing I‚Äôve ever met in my whole life and basically told me that I had to purchase different tickets there even though I had paid for these tickets already and the flight hasn‚Äôt even taken off yet and I was confirmed days before that they were there I will never in my life travel with this airline again I warn you DO NOT TRAVEL WOTH THEM KN THE END THEH ONLY GAVE ME 1 ticket FOR 1CHILD N I STILL HACE YET TO GET THE OTHER ONE N MY SON IS STILL STUCK IN MEXICO
858,"American Airlines has changed recently- not for the good. For many years, my husband and I have been very brand-loyal to AA. I have always enjoyed flying on AA because the seats are reasonably comfortable, the customer service ok, and the flight patterns suited where we needed to go. But lately I have been very unhappy with them, mostly due to the lousy changes they have made to their rewards system. They have actually created a dis-incentive to fly with them because their reward system is now ""floating"" so they can change at any moment based on ""demand"" they say. So there is a constant varying amount of miles it takes for a free flight award. Why would I stay brand loyal if they change the finishing line all the time?"
859,Stone cold incompetence.  Take a hard look at your workforce development programs.  ALL of them please
860,"They rationed our water, charged double for check-in baggage and then had the audacity to charge for internet that didn't work. Will not fly with American airlines again!"

862,"I like flying American for the most part. My bad reviews are really about the customer service from PHL check in and gate agents. I fly quite a bit to even include frontier which I‚Äôd prefer to fly if I‚Äôm flying out/in PHL since their customer service is much nicer. I don‚Äôt know why AA employees are so disgruntled and rude to the passengers but airline tickets are not very cheap, make flying a nice experience for you and me and not be so rude, including to the 80 year old man that hasn‚Äôt flown in years that doesn‚Äôt know how to use the self check in."
863,"WORST AIRLINE EXPERIENCE EVER- DON'T FLY AA- THEY'VE TOTALLY LEFT ME STRANDED IN LONDON AND I CAN'T GET HOME FROM THE HOLIDAYS- CUSTOMER SERVICES DON'T CARE. I paid for a ticket and they revoked the 2nd leg of it arbitrarily without any way of putting it right- don't even know what I""m going to do next „ÄÄ  I'm completely stranded and without help to get back to the US. Don't know what else to try- they're completely uncaring and have stolen my money. I can't afford a plane ticket back and am utterly distraught. üò≠ü§¨ Can't believe what they've done is even legal- they've stolen my money without giving me what was promised. Don't trust them."
864,"I have never met rude cabin staff on any flight, but American Airlines you have the best of the worstWhen one of the cabin staff tell me to shut up because my wife asked him for some milk for her tea and he was shouting at her, because he said that he had already offered her some .that same member pushed his finger at her face in a threatening manner because she asked him for his name.Yes folks fly American Airlines they are the Worst airline I have ever flown with.The dinner served on this flight was inedible I would like to say they served breakfast ,Big Joke chocolate yogurt and a cake thrown onto the tables as they passed byOh yes the happy crew member to avoid is CARLOS MUNOZThe airline to avoid is AMERICAN AIRLINES"
865,Worse Airline ever my Daughter was going back to London with her 3yrs old in stroller and her 10 yrs old son this Airline don't pre board infants they got seats in the back between people they was last to get food and we both fly often with AA but know more.
866,"Among the bottom of the US domestic airlines. Planes are often dated with limited amenities. They have a great network, often affordable flights and multiple flight times but the service leaves A LOT to be desired."
867,"I had a 5-star economy class experienceI think that most of the reviews here are by angry customers and might not reflect the happy ones' thoughts and experience.I flew from LHR to JFK and service was terrific.Complimentary spirits, good food and kind service.Moreover, the flight price was by far the lowest this time of year (holidays)."
868,"WORST AIRLINE......WAITED SO LONG FOR FLIGHT????TRASH.I NEED A REFUND.THANKS, MANAGEMENT."
869,"Horrible!!3 flights done and thousand of issues.The last one from Rome to JFK, they canceled the flight, with no announcement, no text message,NADA. Bad weather ,they said,where?  we asked, because it was clear on NY, at the origin??? you have been rescheduled for tomorrow, of course no hotel for we 4 people,NADA again. next day we have board in different planes my wife and I on one and my sons in another one with connection in North Carolina and guess what, flight to Kansas cancelled again with no hotel of course.We never,NEVER, will put a foot in American Arlines again ,not even with a  free ticket.Worst company ever!"
870,"AA has reached new highs in making air travel as miserable as possible. Cattle cars not airplanes. I just landed and can‚Äôt wait to write this. First of all, after 1000s of air miles, the air crew (not pilots) were the snottiest I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôm in my seat and I see a baggage handler throwing car seats and strollers over railings of the ramp 10 to 12 ft drop (Phoenix). I don‚Äôt have any children but the practice was terrible. One actually looked like it broke. We paid for up front seating, just happens that they change planes so of course the seats we paid extra for were gone. We brought it to the attention of the flight attendant, whose words of wisdom was ‚Äú I just work here, I don‚Äôt do seats‚Äù Plane leaves late and arrives in PHI, 45 minutes late. I am writing my State representative for laws preventing this kind of BS treatment.Anyone that has traveled will remember this...they announce you can one carry on and 1personal bag. Carry on goes up and other item under the seat. They announce this 5time before boarding. It is never enforced...You will most likely live from the crash, but die from the over head luggage."
871,"Don't fly American Airlines!!! We started our trip with our luggage being delayed in Miami.  This meant wasting our first day stressing about having clothes, calling AA and trying to locate our luggage.  We finally went back to the airport and found it ourselves.  This morning our first flight was delayed due to maintenance which caused us to miss our connecting flight.  We have now been put on standby 3 times.  Flights are all overbooked and rude staff have further worsened our experience.  Terrible service - a nightmare experience will lead me to warn all of my friends and family to Never fly AA."
872,"Worst air travel experience I have ever had. We took a flight from SEA to AVP airport with a stopover in PHL. The flight from SEA landed 20 minutes late, only allowing us 10 minutes to catch our connecting flight. We arrived 2 minutes after boarding was closed. I overheard other passengers expressing call concerns of missing their connecting flight, the flight attendant told them 35 minutes would be plenty of time to get to your connecting flight, however we didn't get 35 minutes because we were in the back rows, we had 10 and weren't able to make it from Gate A to F at PHL. When we went to ""customer service"" they advised that the only other available flight they had was to some airport I was unfamiliar with, 15 hours later. As I was on a schedule, that was not an acceptable solution to AA's mistake so I was forced to rent a car and bear the inconvenience of driving to my destination. I have filed a complaint on their website however the only response I've been able to get is from their Twitter, which hasn't been much help either. The customer service running their social media refunded me a pathetic $80 or something like that. I continued to flood Twitter so someone in customer relations called me to discuss my experience. She was completely worthless as well. All she did was explain their policy. I did get $200 in vouchers for a future flight, but unfortunately I have to fly with AA so I will probably sell them at a fraction. Somehow it's against company policy to refund $80 more but whatever. I ended up disputing the difference with my credit card company and got it back. Avoid this company at all costs!"
873,"Avoid this company at all costs.  Family of 4 trip to USA and Caribbean.  Landed in Dallas and connecting flight cancelled.  Went back early next morning to be told again flight cancelled, waved away from desk by very rude member of staff.  Manager not much better.  Forced to pay over 500 dollars for private transfer to enable us to get our cruise.  On return flight they cancelled our flights home to London Heathrow without telling us, first thing we knew about it was when we got to the desk to check in.  After and hour they reinstalled the flights home but we weren‚Äôt in the seats we booked.  Found out later that the had over subscribed the flight (sold our seats again) and were offering people with flexibility 350 dollars to take another flight later.  Flight home was cramped again rude staff who were not in control and basically let the passengers dictate where they sat.  Complained to airline on return on the advice of travel company.  They had no clue whatsoever detailed a long letter explaining everything that had happened in great detail and just didn‚Äôt get it just kept referring to the storm that had cancelled the first flight which we understood.  The thing we were complaining about was the rudeness, lack of interest, the stress caused and the fact that the resold our tickets.  Would never fly with this airline again and would urge others not to either."
874,"This is my first experience with American Airlines, and I must say, it is a lasting experience. My initial flight was arriving late, 17 minutes. No big deal. They called me to the front desk, and asked me if I was willing to take a risk to connect with my original flight, or reschedule. I choose to accept the risk to connect with my existing flight. Upon arriving in Chicago, I was told that I had been kicked of my original schedule, because the ""SYSTEM "" assumed that I wouldn't make it. Even though I accepted the risk. This can't be right, or it. This is a complete inconvenience for all parties concerned. This problem needs to be fixed immediately. Was kind of compensation is due? They just took away your whole day. I don't know about you,  but who wants to spend the entire day in and out of airports. It's the Holidays, fix it. Make your customers whole. I talked to a few agents,  they say they problem has existed forever. If it happens one time,  isn't that one time too many."
875,For the past 40 years I always fly American.  My husband and I were on flight # 1425 on Dec 23rd. DFW to Bradley. So when the one of the pilots walked up to the gate looking drunk or hungover with a terribly wrinkled suit and shirt with his tie loose and his hair a mess I got worried. Those of us waiting to board the plane discussed his lack of professional attire as several noticed it. Luckily the older pilot was dressed very professional. We waited 20 minutes past the boarding time to board the plane because one if the stewardess was 20 minutes late to work.   This made our flight late getting to our destination. American Airlines I know you can do better.
876,"My wife has been waiting for over 30 hours for her luggage.  Hers was the only one lost. They said they would get it to us today. My poor wife has called, and got the same answer. They're not sure where it is. Her work is saved on that iPad that's in the luggage. She deserves better, shes stressed out about it and shes getting no answers.  Please help her, and save the holidays for her. Sad, the customer service is declining,  to the point we are not sure we would ever fly American Airlines again.Truly is sad."
877,"I would give them zero stars if I could. The people that work for American Airline act as if they hate their job. They are burnt out on people and giving good Customer service. This is in Ohio, Texas, and California. My wife travels a minimal of 6-8 times a year. She has flown southwest and delta several times. She flew American last time and had delays but gave it a shot again around the holidays. When I tell you they treated her like a peasant, delayed every single flight, made her miss not one, not two, but three Flights she finally broke down. She missed work, got stuck in LA, and had to spend money we didn‚Äôt plan to spend due to American Airlines failure to stay on track and book proper flights. We will NEVER FLY WITH THEM AGAIN"
878,Worst airline to fly with. They have no customer service what‚Äôs so ever. So rude always delaying flights.
879,"American isn‚Äôt my preferred airline for obvious reasons (delays, notoriously bad service, old planes, and a lack of amenities like WiFi and tv‚Äôs), but now I‚Äôll never spend my money with them again. They took me off an already delayed flight after I‚Äôd already boarded to examine my smart bag. I know that lithium batteries can‚Äôt be taken in the underbelly of the plane and I knew my bag would likely be checked at the gate (why I removed the battery and left it at home in the first place). When they asked me if I had a lithium battery in my bag I said ‚Äúno.‚Äù They then gate checked the bag and allowed me on the plane. After everyone had been boarded (half an hour after we‚Äôd been scheduled to take off) they then called my name out on the speaker. I had to then de-board the plane and re-explain to staff that there was no lithium battery in my bag. The staff didn‚Äôt believe me citing the infallible logic: ‚Äúthere are ports so there‚Äôs a battery.‚Äù I told them again and again that the battery had been removed and the charging ports‚Äîwhile there‚Äîwere inert as they weren‚Äôt attached to the battery. STILL, I had to remove all of my clothes from the bag, and open every single compartment (of which there were many) for them to allow me to get back onto the plane. They were telling me that they might have to ‚Äúrebook the flight‚Äù if my bag couldn‚Äôt get on. I don‚Äôt think I need to explain how agitated/terrified that made me. I‚Äôll obviously never give them my money again."
880,"Flight on Tuesday delayed 3h for no clear reason.Return on Friday first delayed 3h, then cancelled. ""Rebooked for free"" on a flight on Saturday, but charged for premium seat upgrade as no other seats available. Could not talk to a human in reservations or customer service for hours. They are PATHETIC AND UNRELIABLE!"
881,"Absolutely the worst airline ever.Our flight left Vail today at 3pm with 1 hour delay for no reason, arrived to Dallas and also our connection flight to Houston delayed for 2 times. Originally was 8pm, changed to 9:05pm and now it‚Äôs 10:05pm. No reason at all, terrible! We will never fly AA anymore."
882,"We missed our return flight from New Orleans with Delta and ended up on American airlines. Because our tickets were last minute our seats were not together. The stewardess heard we were not sitting together and with my Mother's age and health, American airlines rearranged several passengers seats until we were all sitting together. Both Delta and American airlines went above and beyond for the comfort and safety of Mom.God Bless them."
883,The service staff is not trained to give any answers to the question I asked.  They know nothing about the airline and are not trained with food blankets for emergencies or to meet any need of travelers. This is the last time I travel with them.  My friend in the last 15 days is the second time she has problems with them.  they left his suitcase on his trip to Cuba and the night before returning to Miami was that he could recover it.  on the other hand today we are in punta cana and the plane is broken three hours ago and we are still standing here.  I just lost a 2k dollar job and nobody gives you a worthwhile answer because they are not trained
884,"I traveled alone with two (sleeping) babies and three carry on bags. They took my double stroller, which wasn‚Äôt even 50lbs! I‚Äôve flown multiple times with my double stroller with other airlines before and that was a first. It was awful having to carry both babies and our carry ons with a bad back through the airport. Worse experience I‚Äôve ever had."
885,Price gouging!I travel internationally more than most.  I also take my wife and kids to the bahamas (Atlantis) every couple of years.  I typically spend $350-$450 per seat.  I consider this high but fair to travel on an airline where I have gold status.  The particular travel dates my wife selected this year is currently posted at $980 per seat.  moving those dates 2 days to the right puts us at $390 per seat.  I understand supply and demand but a premium of 250% is immoral.    This puts the flight to travel to Nassau grossly more than the 8 days in a 1 bedroom oceanfront condo on the resort.  I will probably have to cancel the trip.
886,"Dirty aeroplane, no lounge for first class, ruse staff.  Wouldn't use them again"
887,"This airline cannot seem to get a plane off the ground on time in DFW. In Oct they cancelled the second leg of my flt and didn‚Äôt even tell me it was cancelled!  I ended up having to drive from Dallas to Wichita, KS. NO APOLOGY - NO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT!  They didn‚Äôt even refund me the $$ for the part of the flt sequence they messed up. Now, here we are again in DFW headed to OGG (Maui, HI) and we‚Äôre lucky we‚Äôre getting off the ground only 2 hours late. Again, no explanations, no apologies - gate agents standing around laughing, visiting and looking at their cell phones. Unbelievably poor customer service!  It is insulting and unprofessional. I paid more than $1500 for this ticket."
888,"Transferred 4 times, no notification of flight departure change.  Absolutely the worst airline in existence.   Seriously, Miami Gate D60 is like herding cattle.  Agents speaking over each other on intercom.  It looks like a Hurricane evacuation.   I've never seen anything like this airline in my life.  Left Pittsburgh at 8 a.m. and it's almost 10 pm and we still haven't left Miami.  This airline needs shut down."
889,"Dirty plains, grouchy flight attendants, High prices, and misleading information about rewards programs. American Airlines is awful do yourself a favor and use another airline if possible. I flew many flights with them this year including international flights with one world partners. They refuse to honor EQDs and EQMs for certain flights saying they are ineligible after we paid over $3000 for them and checked before booking. This airline is a rip off and care little for customers."
890,I discovered that I left my laptop on previous flight 25 minutes after landing while boarding next flight. I informed the agent and was told to report on line. The plane I had gotten off could not have left yet how hard would it have ben to make a call. It has been over a week now and looking like I will not get my Mac back.
891,"Below is a letter i sent to AA only to get a response saying we have documented this issue and will give a voucher for the UM minor fee.On 12/2/19, my 9 yo daughter was traveling from Madrid>DFW>SFO.  I get a call at 11pm PST stating that she cannot check in due to the unaccompanied minor fee not being paid.  When I booked this flight it was mandatory that both unaccompanied minor fees were paid for both ways.  While on the phone with the agent she confirmed both ways were paid.  Unfortunately when I was sent my trip confirmation unaccompanied minor doesn‚Äôt show up on that.  After receiving the phone call I immediately called the airlines to fix this problem and was told that somehow the system must have dropped the unaccompanied minor for the trip back.  At that time I offered to pay this fee and was told that they could not take my payment over the phone!!!  So here I have my 9yo daughter in Spain and I can‚Äôt pay for her to get here.  NOT OK AT ALL.  I then suggested that this fee be waived since this was American Airlines fault, the agent also mentioned that should could not do this as well.  Again, there is a 9yo little girl stuck at the airport very upset because she thinks she isn‚Äôt coming home.  Thank god a stranger ended up paying for her unaccompanied minor fee at the gate in Spain.  If this very generous person didn‚Äôt take care of this my child would be stuck alone in a foreign country.  NEXT ISSUE‚Ä¶. My daughter gets to DFW at 1:35PM.  Her next flight is scheduled to leave DFW at 4:49.  After 13 delays the new time to depart is 11:05PM.   10 hours she is sitting in the airport and during this time she was not in the unaccompanied minor room, they had her sitting in the gate area ALONE.  I had called the gate multiple times to make sure she was ok and that someone there had fed her.  I was told she was fed a cookie, chips and some soda, she was NOT fed a hot meal.  I then asked where she was and was told she was asleep in a chair next to the gate!!!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!.  Anyone could have picked her up and taken her.  There is a huge issue with human trafficking in Texas, but yet my 9yo was left in the main area and not in the unaccompanied minor room where she should have been.  At this point I finally get a hold of a manager named Coco.  She apologized for everything and took my daughter to get a hot meal and back to the UM room.  (7 hours too late).  In addition my daughter was mingling with people at the gate and even ate with some random family.  Coco was the only amazing thing about this trip home for my daughter.  No one called me to update me, no one tried to get this 9yo on another flight to another nearby airport.  I looked up the other flights and plenty went out before flight 2393I am beyond livid and I am very close to seeking legal counsel.  Where in American Airlines mind is any of this ok.  You put my child in great danger.  I will never ever fly your airlines again and will make sure others are aware of the horrible customer service with your airlines.  I did receive a voucher for the UM service, however I would like a full refund."
892,f*** them. they act like bunch of gangs who doesn't know customer service and treat customers like s***.
893,"Complaint to American Airlines:This was my first time flying American Airlines and this was the first time employees lied to me without even being slick about it. Companies like all the time, but man, these lies were so obvious. 1st lie: me and 20 other people were waiting in line to get seats because we were all too cheap to pay extra (also, Southwest would've been the same price after all the extra damn fees y'all charge). The plane is already boarding people and the gate attendants say they are having a technical issue. I turn to the women behind me and make a joke about how cheap we all were and I told her that this is my first time flying American. She told me this is her second time flying American and the first time, they had the same issue with booking seats. Coincidence or lie? You tell ME. 2nd lie: everyone boards the plane and we are going in circles in the tarmac. The pilot gets on the intercom and say they are waiting for the runway to clear. He returns to the gate and gets on the intercom again 20 min later saying that they cannot fly because they were going to go over their time limit. They got to have known that before people even boarded their flight. Let's be real. They were making stuff up. I was thinking that they would just change flight crew and instead, they made us deplane! 3rd lie: I was getting multiple emails of my flight being delayed. First to 1:01am then to 1:30am then to 4:30am and lastly to 8:30am. I had to sleep in the airport. There would be no point in getting the free hotel because by the time I would get to the hotel, it would be 2:30 and I would have to leave for the airport at 5am because of morning traffic. I was supposed to work Monday and had to call out. I also had to use Uber to get a ride home because originally, my boyfriend was going to pick me up. How will you compensate me?Response from American Airlines:We will compensate you with a $175 voucherResponse BACK to American Airlines:When checking in online, I was asked if I would like to voluntarily give up my spot for a voucher starting at $200 and going up to $500. In this case, I was forced out of my spot to take a flight 8+ hours later due to poor planning of the companie's part. $175 is a slap in the face to your customers. I had to use PTO for Monday, in which case is worth $230 plus the $27 Uber ride I had to take home. Please do better than $175.*1 week has gone by and still no response"
894,Flight from Charlotte to Phoenix on 10 Dec 2019.  Flight took off 30 minutes late and arrived 30-45 minutes late at Phoenix.  Pilots never greeted the passengers nor gave any updates.  Not one update.  Flight was late and missed my next flight.
895,We got off an AA flight from Boston to LA and needed to catch an AA flight to San Diego.  We had 1hr between flights.  The flight from Boston was delayed on the tarmac for 20 minutes waiting for a gate. When we deplaned there was no one from AA to direct to the gates. I approached one AA gate attendant who said he didn't know anything.  We needed to take an AA shuttle to another gate and joined a long line we waited for the shuttle for 15 minutes and missed the flight as did several others. We missed the flight by 2  minutes. There were no other flights to San Diego that night so AA put us up at Aloft. The next morning our AA flight was delayed for 90 minutes due to a technical problem. We landed in San Diego at 1pm.
896,"BEWARE ‚Äì AMERICAN AIRLINES and BRITISH AIRWAYS codeshares HIDE ridiculous fees.  In booking an amazing family trip to South Africa, booked flights through Chase Sapphire Card website on AMERICAN AIRLINES.  While we knew flights were a codeshare with BRITISH AIRWAYS, it was NOT DISCLOSED that BRITISH AIRWAYS will charge $100-$200 per person per segment to select a seat.  Calls to British Airways and American were useless.  AMERICAN AIRLINES referred to BRITISH AIRWAYS (undisclosed) policy and British Airways was ‚Äúsorry I felt that way‚Äù about their policy. Could not select seats day of booking and learned too late too cancel about the UNDISCLOSED fees.  Very poor disclosure and customer service all around."
897,"I would not even give 1 star. We were left stranded in Philadelphia after our plane from Cancun to Philadelphia took off late and we had to run through the airport in Philly and they closed the doors knowing we were coming ( missed them closing the door by 1 minute and would not open it) they left a total of 16 people without any flights. Stranded and would not pay for any car rentals, hotels or anything else. Told us you are on your own. We had to rent a car and drive 5 hours on our own dime and rearrange our whole lives. They have NO CUSTOMER SERVICE, VERY RUDE EMPLOYEES.  If you can do not fly with American."
898,"Before I begin to go into details about our nightmare with American airlines, let me state that the fore mentioned provider will NEVER receive another red cent from me!!!!My wife and I did everything we could to make our connecting flight----early arrival to our first flight and literally ran through the Philadelphia airport. When we firstattemped to  leave our original flight, we were told that the pilot would need 8-10 minutes to de-ice the plane....news flash it was 30*, why wasn't this done before we ever boarded?!!! During the process of de-icing, we were boxed in by 2 other airplanes (I find no fault in American airlines for this one). Up to this point I was patient and not upset AT ALL.  However,  when the original plane made no effort to contact the tower to get connecting flight to hold for 10 minutes and running through the airport, I was extremely livid!! A single phone call and holding the plane for 10 minutes would have solved the issue!!! If we were at fault, I would have had no one to blame but myself, I had no control over this AT ALL. I would advise anyone considering flying with American airlines to reconsider and if there are ANY other choices take them. AGAIN, American airlines will NEVER RECEIVE ANOTHER PENNY FROM US!!! BE ADVISED WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH $200 WORTH OF LAS VEGAS SHOW TICKETS....OH YEA NOT AAs PROBLEM?!!!"
899,I flew from Heathrow to Raleigh the staff were kind helpful and just made my flying experience awesome thank you AA you're the best I look forward to my flight back to London ü§ó‚ô•Ô∏èü§ó
900,"The employees at Dallas airport  at the gate were very rude and inconsiderate to there customers! They even were harassing this lady and grabbed her arm which they had no right on doing!! She had the right amount of bags! she had a small wallet purse, a carry on and a small duffle bag! They didn't even tell us we had a 20 minute delay at all! On top of that three of there employees was ganging up on her and yelling at her! She was shaking and almost in tears! I will never go with this airline ever again!! They were unorganized and they had terrible seating on the planes."
901,"So we booked a vacation through Apple vacations and we were told all our seats were in one row we have two children 6 and 11.  We were told our seats were all together to and from Boston to Montego Bay in return. After we book the flight they sent the confirmation to us we noticed that we were bumped from our seats to Montego Bay. We called Apple vacations and were told that it was an error on American Airlines.  We were told we needed to contact American Airlines to correct it so I did, I called and waited an hour to speak to someone regarding this issue and after speaking to a regular customer service representative I was told there was nothing I could do my six-year-old and 11-year-old needed to sit alone on the plane in different seats unless I paid an additional $200   Plus the seat charge it was $50 per person to move the seats plus an additional charge for the seat charge that ranged anywhere from $37 and up. When I tried to reason with them and explain that I can‚Äôt have a six-year-old sitting by them self or an 11-year-old because of safety issues it did not matter. I spoke with the manager at length at no time did it matter that a 6 year old would sit with strangers..... What is this world coming  to when they need to make an extra $350 on a flight when I‚Äôve already spent $6000. So sad!!!!!!!!"
902,"Booked a flight for myself and a friend to Rio, Brazil on Sept 21, 2019, to fly in late Feb 2020. I have a mobility disability. This evening, i receive an email stating American Airlines (AA) has made a change. What they actually did was change my entire itinerary and my friends, as we are travelling together. I called the customer relations line, was on hold for an hour, and when i spoke to the lady on the other end, she was aggressive and told me there was a ""schedule change made"". This was false someone changed the entire travel plan on the outgoing and return flights. The CS lady was seriously a rude B****. Clearly if AA has hired her, that is the service level one will get. AA's changes to out flights did not take into consideration my mobility disability, nor did it take in to account are other travel plans to get to the Toronto airport. I have had to hang up with that rude, nasty lady, and call again, Here i wait over an hour for a call back. NEVER book a flight with this airline. I hope they either restore my original flights, or return all my money.  Record Locator is BXOMRP, i have tried to speak to a supervisor or manager, and its impossible to get anywhere with American Airlines. Perhaps if one starts a legal claim i will hear from someone and get some results."
903,"Too many old planes and old seats, rude staff, I avoid them if I can and choose other airlines. Cabin service should be improved as for the last few flights I felt service was very very rushed and I had almost no time to finish before trays were cleared again."
904,"After boarding plane were asked to get off stating fuel door issue.  After the 2 hour delay we take off and miss our connecting flight in miami by 15 minutes to aruba where vaca is planned.  We then book the flight for next morning and figure well stay in miami for the day and overnight.  We find out our luggage is getting held for next days flight or we can wait 2 to 8 hours in airport until they find it.  Then, they give us a free night at the miami airport hotel which was for lack of a better term, horrendous (rather than in our paid for hotel in aruba).  They were nice enough to give us food vouchers for $12 per person in total.  Considering we had wait 20 hours this was the final slap in the face and didnt eve cover breakfast.I understand problems, delays etc but the way they handle this situation is nothing but corporate greed and no regard for customer service."
905,"Great seat, upgraded onboard, Chicago to Miami. Staff are always best out of the US carriers I use. Will def keep using AA."
906,Flight 5833 out of Fresno they are awful! Got upgraded to first class and nothing. The flight attendants were rude and not attentive at all!! If I had more status with Delta; I would fly with them.
907,"Seat allocation is so bad, they will deliberate seat you apart, so you have no choice but to pay. 0n a 3-3-3 the middle seat is free, the other are $81.All airlines give free allocation 24 hrs before, but not American Airline. I will avoid this airline at all costs.B.Lad"
908,"Purchased a ticket and needed to cancel due to the hospitalization of my mother. AA said 7-10 days.  It has been more than 10 days and still no refund.  No human can help me when I get through after 44 mins on hold.....said to resend the documentation.  Done, Done, Done again......no response, no confirmation, no refund.  Seriously?"
909,"We were prohibited from sitting in the exit aisle that was completely empty.  We tried and were kicked out.  Moments later, a 300 lbs+ male was relocated there, who had not paid extra either. Moral:  eat up for a free upgrade!"
910,I love flying American Airlines. I fly almost monthly. I enjoy their courteous staff and clean airplanes. Flew to Dublin last July and had a great experience. I was even able to order a gluten free meal in advance!
911,Worst airline ever. Disgusting service üò° and filled with mediocre employee culture. Skip this at all costs. Fly Delta or Southwest
912,"I have never flown with such a disgraceful airline in my life, I didn‚Äôt even know anything so bad existed these days!Forget budget airlines, American Airlines is top of the list for all the wrong reasons.  4 hours delayed due to some imbecile forgetting to sign some paper work over a flat tyre.  The captain didn‚Äôt let us know what was going on, the app kept auto booking us on different connecting flights, utterly Incompetent customer service on both the American and the English side.  The plane which was supposed to be taking us on a long haul trip (over 8 hours) had tiny, uncomfortable seats, no seat back televisions, a few overhead tv‚Äôs badly placed with bad quality. The whole experience was so awful we insisted on getting off the plane and gave up on our trip to America! Shambles."
913,"Delay, after delay. They don‚Äôt care about people plan. Extremely bad experience. May be next time I should not consider this airlines."
914,I signed up for the American Airline credit card during a flight to Hawaii for the miles when I tried to redeem the miles for a trip to California American Airlines made it sooo difficult.  Not worth it!!!! In the future I will avoid American Airlines if at all possible!!!!!!
915,"We had a plane that had mechanical problems with auxiliary fuel tanks which couldn‚Äôt be filled in a normal way.  They came up with an alternative way to fuel the tanks,  but once in the air they couldn‚Äôt be used.  The pilot scared us all by saying because we had 7500 lbs of fuel in those auxiliary tanks we might have an unbalanced landing. A 6 hour flight across the country turned into a 12 hour ordeal where we had to change out planes.  The second plane didn‚Äôt get prepped right and we had to wait for hours to get the snacks and drinks put on board. We should never have taken off in the first place, and not to have the 2nd plane ready was crazy.Plus we were offered no free food or vouchers or any form of apology."
916,"It all started with a flight from Miami to Brazil. Eleven of us traveled to see my grandparents that are in the end of their lives.I called a week earlier to request gluten free meals for my family of 4. In the plane, the flight attendants were littery rude! Not only to us but to everyone. Practically throwing the food on the tables. No manners at all. In my case, they lost my gluten free meal so, I was went hungry! My kids and my husband said the food was awful!On the way back, the same thing happened, those people must hate their Job! Marcus, one of the flight attendants was the worst. They treated my disabled father like a junk. He explained he pain extra for a more comfortable seat. They did not care!! At dinner time, the meal tasted awful, for breakfast, everyone was given a cold turkey sandwich. 3 people from my family had bowel complications right after eating it. The 4 of us that received gluten free meals, got the worse eggs we ever tasted. How can you mess up scrambled  eggs?Our children were starving!!Do not fly with them!! You will regret it!!"
917,"Unity2112 (0 review)Worst experience of my life. Me and my husband just got married and planned our honeymoon in palm spring cali. We suppose to fly chicago and then psp. So drama begins when weather got bad. First we flew all the way chicago ,due to bad snow we couldn't landed. So for 2 or more hours we were in air. Finally after so much gamble they took us Columbia Ohio. Now another drama begun when Columbia airport said they have no terminal so we seat in plan another 2 hours. Finally we get off from the plan . After 2 hours we fl6back chicago. We had connecting flight to cali. Now another drama begin when our connected flight delayed for 18 times since morning 10. They keep delaying flight every hour . Instead just cancelled flight earlier they gambled all day and finally at 8 in evening canceled our flight. Send us to other counter to rebook. Now AA has no flight for cali until wed. And no flight to fly back newark (home) . So we end up paying money 4 hotel we stayed at chicago. Lost money we payed in California for homonym hotel. Parking 4 car. And two day work . When I tried to call and ask for refund they send me voucher so I can rebook with American airline only and go throw another nightmare, horrible experience.eventually fraud airline plz be aware"
918,My name is Tony Archuleta I flew American Airlines and it was the most worst airline service I‚Äôve ever had to deal with I had to ask for my drink when they walked past me giggling and laughing got my drink by the person with an attitude all the stewardess did was stand up front giggling and laughing the whole flight through ridiculous customer service My flight number was 777 the date I flew was November Eighth through the 10th coming back from Vegas the customer service representative stewardess on the plane were acting very childish I will never fly American Airlines even if it cost me more to go with another airline
919,I was hoping to give zero not 1. They don't communicate at all with connecting flights so very easy to miss a flight. Horrible service.
920,They deserve zero stars. Worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life! üñïto American Airlines.
921,"American Airlines changed our flight 4 times, we ended up stuck in Phoenix with meal vouchers after everything is closed! We were charged for a hotel and rental car we weren't able to use and lost tickets to an NFL game and ferry ride! They do not care, at all! All I asked for was a refund for my flight. I was told there was no supervisor on duty and no phone number I could call to make a complaint!! Worst airlines ever!!!"
922,"I was traveling with my wife who has an injured shoulder and couldn't carry any bags. So I had to stow away her luggage etc. I was "" randomly selected"" for an extra search. This racial profiling is normal for me being a south Asian male with a beard. But this for some reason meant I couldn't reserve a seat next to my wife (never happens when other providers randomly select me) so I had to hold up other passengers while helping her get settled (no one wanted to swap seats). Despite discussing the issue of seating with staff, considering my wife's arm being in a sling, I was told there was nothing they could do. I was also given the same answer when asking them to help her with her luggage and getting her settled in her seat. Luckily passengers were understanding and weren't too upset about me holding everyone up to help her. So remember, if you think you are going to need any extra help with your flight, don't pick American airlines as ""there is nothing they can do"" (new motto alert!)"
923,"This is my 2nd review. American Airlines never responded to my first review.On July 1 2019, I flew from Raleigh Durham to Charlotte to London Heathrow.I checked in one Suitcase ar RDU on Flight AA595 from RDU-CLT and took a connection to London. CLT -LHR on Flight No:732. Upon arrival at LHR, I have noticed a 14"" tear, Zip was broken and open, Lock was missing. I immediately notified AA. They took some Photos.I claimed about ¬£1100 for the missing items; Jamal Farrow offered me only ¬£51. What a shame. Arrogant and Racist Airlines as most of the Americans are. Either you avoid this Airline or carry a good Insurance. They are shameless and do not want to save their face,I travelled under a name; Rajinder S. Dhillon.Ref No: AA- 19DHILLON-H65017-Post."
924,American Airlines will not make any attempt to cover lost baggage! After researching I have discovered they are the #1 airline with lost baggage claims. They are also notorious horrible customer service!  Do not fly with them if you value your belongings!!!! They lost my bag on a flight from Nashville to Miami in July. After months of time spent filling out questionaires and sitting on hold they refused to provide any compensation!
925,"I had a 10:40pm flight out of San Diego. The flight attendant was late, and so the flight had to be cancelled (after we were already on the plane). The next flight wasn't until 3pm the following day.As we were being kicked off the flight, they told us they would pay for our hotel for the night (since there were no more flights).I went to my hotel, and booked a flight with Southwest airlines at 10am the next morning so I could get back when I needed to.After contacting American Airlines, they said since I did not book my replacement flight with them, they wouldn't cover my hotel room.I expect cancellations and delays with airlines, but when their mistake greatly inconveniences their customers, I would expect them to go above and beyond in taking care of them.I will not be flying American Airlines again, and neither will any of my employees."
926,"I flew with them 5 times in the last month and EVERY SINGLE FLIGHT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DELAYED. I can excuse once but 5/5 is completely ridiculous. Examples of issues included weather, pilot still flying in on another flight, cockpit mechanical issue, mis-timing of runway take off. Staff relatively unapologetic can tell this is the usual thing for them. TWICE missed connection and had to stay over, missed work, and no hotel vouchers offered."
927,"The worst airlines ever is American Airlines,they lost my luggage 13 days ago,i spent half of my vacation calling/searching/shopping because every day they told me it is on the way or is in some other city and coming next day and so on for 13 days...never again,i would rather pay 200euros/dollars more to Lufthansa/Emirates/United then ever fly with you agin...and btw to this airlines your time means nothing..."
928,"I booked a round trip ticket with miles, then realized that I have to change the dates. I cancelled the tickets pretty quickly within the required 24 hour limit. My miles never came back to my account. I need those miles to rebook the tickets... I was checking my account every day to see if those valuable miles came back or not... after waited for 7 days, I called in. The representative said somehow ""the ""system"" did not detect the timely cancellation"". He did initiate the refund and I got the miles immediately back on my account. But, if it's someone who has tons of miles, and after the cancellation, did not realize the miles never back onto your account, it would be a loss."
929,"American and Marriott Bonvoy are running a scam where they get you to cash in Marriott points for AAdvantage points by offering a 5000 mile bonus.  The exchange rate is horrible...don't do it!  I lost 45,000 points by responding to the offer and wantedto cancel immediately and they won't cancel.  They keep referring to their fine print.  What a classless way to handle a long time customer of over 30 years."
930,"Hands down worst business class experience I have ever had. Long wait at priority check in for both legs of the flight, poor onboard service, cranky stewardesses. In business class had to pay extra $20 for WiFi!Last but not least, headphones were collected 1 hour prior to landing!"
931,I had a horrible experience on flight  2229 at 9.56 Am on October 26 From Boston to Phoenix we had carry on and the plane was a full plane and ask us to check our laggage in for free so we did we brought them down the boarding Hall and left them there and we did not see our laggage until we got to Flagstaff had my jewelry in the laggage and brought my dimond cross and gold necklace in with my cosmetic jewelry and when I got to the hotel li was missing and know they went into my luggage and stole it sham on that person that belongs to my mother that has been gone over 24 years I will never go American Airlines again I am heart brokenüòûüòûüòûüòû
932,"I travel internationally quite often, but have never flown with American. The customer service was appalling, food was literally thrown at us, only one drinks service, then lights out for 7 hours until just before landing. When we checked in for the return flight, we were sitting in totally different parts of the plane, and the only available seats together required us paying an additional $93. I will never fly with American again."
933,"Amaerican Airlines hates families with children. AA is the only airline ive flown with that does not allow families with small children the courtesy of preboarding. They compound the problem by placing us at the very back of the plane and board us in the last group. They prefer that we drag our children and items down a packed plane with people seated in the aisles and hit them with our stuff as we take our kids and car seats and 8 bags to our seats at the back of the plane with no help whatsoever from the agents who are busy preparing for takeoff and serving in first class. Furthermore, our bags with diapers and formula will be placed half way up the aircraft away from us if we are even fortunate enough to have any overhead bin space left to keep our babys things with us. But I'm betting this keeps the first class passengers happy that the crying babies are as far from them as possible. Not to mention the lineups for the washroom at back of the plane guarantees an audience should I have to nurse my baby. During our flight, the lineup never had less than 5 people waiting. THEY ARE THE WORST!!"
934,"This is a complaint against the greedy airline, putting the smaller seats and reducing leg room is absolutely stupid; maybe you believe you are earning more money and I don't doubt you are. But also you earning discredit, among all people I have asked and my own experiences using your services, we all agree American airlines is the worst. Horrible service, uncomfortable seats."
935,"It was my fault.  I left my passport on my desk as I left for SFO.  The agents not only helped me get my passport to the airport, but did it in time to get me on the next flight to Paris in just a few hours.  There was no change charge, the agent was simply friendly and helpful when they could have been understandably judgemental and have insisted on my buying another ticket or even just a change fee.  I caused a problem and they fixed it."
936,"The flight schedule got changed and they refused to put me on another, more convenient flight or issue a full refund. Once flight was sold by Finnair (but booked as AA flight) through booking agent, they say it is not their responsibility. Don't use this company. Stay away!"
937,"Honestly, I am extremely disappoint by American Airlines. They are normally my airline of choice and I have put many of miles into them. That will no longer be the case... I had a connecting flight canceled due to ‚Äúweather‚Äù even though there was a flight going out an hour later...???? Since it was due to weather we were offered no accommodations. When asked about this they said it was the pilots choice to delay or cancel ... since a flight went out an hour later I‚Äôd say that wasn‚Äôt due to weather but to crew.... ok but it gets better. We were put on standby on that late flight when we showed up somehow I was five on the list and my husband was 32?!?!? So I got called yet was told nothing could be done to get my husband on as well.. even though after I was called a group of four was called together then two more singles. When I asked the customer service desk about this I was told it was the computer. So I asked how the group of four managed to get out on the list together and they said luck of pushing the enter button.. lol what a joke... then was told since I also had booked an economy ticket it pretty much didn‚Äôt look good for me anyways from the beginning so that‚Äôs great to know that‚Äôs how this airline feels. Such a shame too because they have some great people we have encountered who work as attendant for this airline that this has now given them such a bad name in my book. Long story short I thought this was a great airline and now I have been completely proven wrong and they could care less."
938,"They cancelled our flight, after that everything fell apart.  It‚Äôs not even worth writing a review.  They are horrible, lesson learned, never again."
939,AA is trash. Had a flight from houston to dallas. Showed up an hour and 20 minutes early. Had to wait in a long line to check in and pay for a bag. Once I got to the counter my card couldn't be processed. Had to go to a different line where the csa just began booking me on the next flight with no explanation. I asked her why I was getting moved to the next flight and she stated that i had missed the luggage cut off time and that I would be on the next flight. I canceled the flight and had to uber to hobby to catch a southwest flight. Aa acts as if your time isn't important. Will never do business with these tools again.
940,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.My girlfriend had a flight to San Diego but needed to get off at the connection in PHX. When she got to the gate, Ivana was very rude and forced her to check her 1 of 2 allowable carry-on bags. She would not even let me explain the situation and kept saying ""you can check your bag or stay home"". When we asked for information on the process to retrieve the bag she said ""you'll have to figure it out.""If a representative from AA is reading this and cares about the public image of your company, I highly recommend forwarding this review to the leadership of the SJC airport branch for AA to investigate the performance of Ivana, the gate employee assigned to flight AA2105."
941,Don‚Äôt ever fly this airline.  The last six times I booked my first class ticket (way overpriced anyway) they either cancelled and or delayed my flights.  This is a pattern with them and you don‚Äôt get any vouchers or reimbursement from them.  They cancelled a flight so I had to get a hotel room in the airport at $400 a night and was told I would be reimbursed. I got a whopping $150 TRAVEL voucher to use on my next flight.  They also lose luggage all the time and are no help in finding it.
942,"Such bad and poor service. Our flight was delayed overnight with no reimbursement for hotel, food, anything. I will never choose American airlines again"
943,If I could give a minus 1 I would. Gate agents are not trained consistently. Rules change from person to person or airport to airport. I have flown several times with a carry on bag that no agents nor airports have had an issue with until flying out of LAX. I intentionally pack less so I‚Äôm not inconvenienced by waiting on baggage. I‚Äôm a frequent flyer so I know the ropes. It‚Äôs a shame that customer service standards have fallen so low.
944,"Not even paying business class you can get a wheel chair to the gate in miami after surgery.  3rd trip in a row with aa this happenes. Thought that by paying business class you would make an effort to keep the customer happy. Boy was I wrong. I am an influencer and manage talent and I will spreas this news of AA inhumanity towards handicapped customers. Its shameful. You charge for every lugagge, every change hundreds of dlls but cant have a whee at the gate ever. Had to wait an hour at a holding spot ... So sad you trear ppl like that. Its all aboit money! Planes are uncomfortable no more tvs even.in business and staff is super rude."
945,This is the worst Airlines going for not being on time and changing flight gates consistently. Also you will miss your connecting flight because they never leave on time. They never schedule there flights appropriately. You need at least a two-day cushion going and coming. They were literally hold you over and cancel your flights very frequently. Good luck with this Airline. American is one of the richest Airlines in America. However they treat their customers like crap. We change Gates eight times and spent 30 hours waiting in airport terminals for a simple domestic flight from Wichita Kansas to Greensboro North Carolina. You would have thought we were going to South America or something. We spent countless dollars on overpriced airport food. We also have to stay overnight in a motel in a bad part of town in Wichita Kansas. Beware of flying American they are never on time and frequently cancel flights. They change terminals quite frequently because of tardiness and lateness. I am surprised they have not been sued for pain and suffering. My wife has health issues and now has worst issues from running through airports trying to catch our connecting flights. Then we would get there and they would be canceled or delayed for at least 2 to 4 hours. Now 30 hours later we are finally back home. Good luck with American if any lawyers are out there give us a shout. But as big and rich as they are they really don't care about the American Consumer. A 19-hour Amtrak ticket would be the better call for Wichita Kansas. Or at least driving in 14 hours. Beware of flying it will take you at least 24 to 30 hours in layovers from Wichita Kansas.
946,"I wish I could give them 0 stars,was leaving NewOrleans to go to Cabo through Dallas and flight was cancelled for maintenance issues.Spoke to captain who was flying plane back to Dallas and said it was an old broke down MD-80 built in the 90‚Äôs and was being decommissioned and sold to a third world country to fly cargo.Got a $12 food credit voucher rerouted through Chattanooga TN to Dallas for flight next AM. Lost a day and a half at all inclusive in Cabo and AA says they will do nothing.Also my bag stayed in Chattanooga and I had no clothes for two more days.AA is pitiful and staff is obnoxious and useless.Timothy Morales"
947,AA is so horrible that I flew from Boston  to Brasilia with  onnection in Miami 9/5/19 returning  9/20/19 The service was so terrible that 3 of my flights I experienced a severe delays Hope this was my last time that with AA
948,"Returning from Reno, NV turned out to be a miserable experience as AA in Reno, NV kept delaying the flight we got there early for.  After finally taking off, my wife's app notified us change in connecting flights in Phonix as we were running that late.  While in Phonix, AZ our new connecting flight was rerouted to Dallas/Ft Worth as no longer had flight to Orlando, our final destination.  While waiting on this new fight out of Phonix to Dallas/Ft Worth, plane continued to be delayed.  One reason was plane coming out of Hanger had to wait to cross all the busy runways.  Another reason was computer issues and Monitors showing Flight Complete before it even arrived at gate. Yet another reason for delay was after plane was at gate, apps would not update with folks new boarding passes.   My wife and I had to wait patiently while the lady at g me gate could issue us new boarding passes as it was difficult for her to accomplish with so many flight changed.  After we took off and headed for Dallas/Ft.Worth, we noticed we may miss our new connecting flight to Orlando.  When we landed we had 12mins to reach out connecting flight, but it took all of that time to get off the plane.  When we rode the monorail to our next gate, pane had already left and no one working the gate.  Went to Customer Service where they explained no more flights out of there to Orlando until next day.  We were giving a hotel vochure and meal ticket.  We had to tip courtesy van ourselves both from and to the airport.  Finally flew to Orlando.  Only worse experience before this was a few years back when Delta left me stranded while trying to reach my mother-in-law's funeral.  Thus Big Airlines don't care about you, they already got your money.  US Gov. Doesn't care either."
949,"Loaded cattle trucks of the skies. Imagine boarding your aged and tired old A321 from LA to Hawaii. Once you've boarded your informed of a 20 minute wait as the pilot is with the other 13 passengers still yet to land. That's ok, well done for herding!, you've cleared the terminal of a couple hundred customers (cows). Now you wait as occupancy or as they say, PAX optimisation is achieved by delaying everyone. The plane is old. None of the on board entertainment works, holding the ear plugs into the holder so as to hear anything for 5 hrs? Constant stopping of in flight entertainment. Constant advertising, I mean constant. In flight entertainment, intercom, hostesses flogging the American Airlines credit card that offers 30000 points when you accept the offer. The airline hostesses were either understaffed one trolley of beverages with 2 staff and 1 trolley of food with 1 staff member.  Now that is for a slow service.Arrival late,  that's ok cause all seats filled?Cattle herders of the skies. Pitty it's a customer service industry.  Now we spend day one Hawaii sore and disjointed.  Not the way we planned arriving Hawaii."
950,We were mis sold main cabin extra for over $200 dollars.  Turns out that complimentary drinks are included in all long haul flights.  Staff were rude and took the shine off of a once in a life time holiday.  DMd them and their approach is not to resolve complaints but to use the feedback as an improvement tool.
951,It appears that I and  a review above have had a similar experience as Leanne Cory also mishandled my particular complaint. She called me three to four times in a row at 5 AM on a Sunday morning to inform me that AA had been so kind to provide me with a $6.75 refund - out of around $178 that was actually owed by the company due to their mishanding of my booking.
952,"Flight attendants seemed mad on a flight from Dallas to Philadelphia. Not friendly at all. I dont understand the boarding process either.  It  was much  quicker when you loaded from the back of the plane to the front instead of this group boarding, just so people with the American Airlines credit card can be seated first. I currently dont have the credit card but I only fly American so why am I always group 8, no matter what seats I  have booked.It also helps when you see someone with 3 bags boarding to stop them instead of allowing them to board and take up overhead space that forces others to check bags."
953,The worst airline company period!!! I had a 2 hours delay on my flight instead of 6.30 we left the airport only at 8.30 and when I talked to costumer service they was arguing with me about the delay time they say it was less then one hour. I don‚Äôt recommend this company even to my enemies. This airline should be shut down!! ASAP
954,"Flew 1st class Dallas to Hawaii and rtn.I will never fly on AA again.Treated like cattle.  Absolutely no better service than I had in coach.If I won a ticket on AA I would give away to a homeless person.Customer service, wothless.Still no response on complaint. Nothing on claim."
955,"ZERO star review. Absolutely the worst airline I have ever experienced. Our flight has been delayed an entire 24 hours because of ‚Äúair congestion‚Äù meaning there are going to be too many planes in the air. We were notified a few hours before our plane was scheduled to depart. Prior to this delay, I received over 20 texts, some minutes from each other, that my flight has been delayed again and again and again and again. After reading other reviews regarding this airline, it seems as though this is a reoccurring issue with American Airlines. Avoid this airline at all costs. Absolutely ridiculous."
956,"The WORST airline EVER. Can't believe it is still operating. Literally stole money from people (including myself) by overcharging them using the wrong currency, denied it and got away with it. SHAME! Will never forgive them and will never forget this bad experience. Marked for life.If there was a 0-star rating (or even a -1 one), that's what I would give American Airlines."
957,"I flew from London to GSP in July with five children ( one being only 2 years old ) when we arrived from London in Chicago, our flight was delayed twice and then cancelled. How did I know it was cancelled? The staff at the desk unplugged the monitor and went home. Already having been delayed twice we had been sitting in the airport for a while.  I couldn‚Äôt move easily because the airline had my stroller. I couldn‚Äôt find a member of staff to help me or advise me at all. No idea when my rebooked flight would be, where I would sleep the night. Legally I couldn‚Äôt really leave the airport without a car seat so I‚Äôm stuck in a town I don‚Äôt know, with five tired children and NOT ONE single member of staff to assist. I don‚Äôt even know when the next flight will be ! This is disgusting service. I had to go find a taxi that would take us without a car seat, help me find a hotel that could accommodate and pay for this all myself.  When I complained to the airline they said they take no responsibility for anything that happens to passengers if they cancel a flight. So I highly recommended never flying with this airline as you could just get left mid flight in a random location without any support or assistance. And guess what!? They don‚Äôt care ! I would go as far as saying it could be a health and safety risk to leave a mother with five children in this situation. Had I fallen asleep in the airport, the child could have been kidnapped or fallen down an escalator etc. With no ability to even get my belongings I couldn‚Äôt secure the child or safely travel with her."
958,"Every time I fly American there is so type of problem due to incompetent employees who don‚Äôt know what they are doing. We have flown American about 4 times and the first time we flew them we signed up for their Aadvantage card thinking it would be worth getting the miles... WRONG. On our most recent trip our flight on Tuesday Sep. 3 was canceled due to the hurricane back home in Florida. They let us pick which flight back and only had one Thursday with a layover. My boyfriends sister was flying back to Miami the same day which did not get canceled. That night we called American to get on that flight back so we could just drive home and not be stuck in LA for three extra days. The lady on the phone named crystal told my boyfriend that we can‚Äôt change our flight to land into another city because we bought our tickets using the points from our AAdvantage card? ... okay what?! What ever.... that night we booked two extra nights on a hotel that was over 100$ a night because we were going to be stuck here. The next morning I got a notification letting me know there are two extra flights available to take Tuesday morning that would land us in Melbourne Florida and NOT ORLANDO.. which didn‚Äôt make any sense considering the worker said there are no flights for us besides Orlando. We call in the morning again to see about getting on the flight to Miami yet again and the lady on that phone said we COULD DO IT. So she put us on that flight so we could get home that day. We did not have enough clothes or even money to be able to spend two and a half extra days in LA between the hotel, rental car, gas etc. Of course the hotel was non refundable and we had to argue with them to get our money back. BUT all of this could have been avoided if the employees knew what the hell they were doing. So we get to the airport Tuesday morning to head on the Miami flight which the app told us that we had to go to a counter to check in. So of course the workers holding the line up asks us what we are doing which we show them the phone and they go ‚Äúwell did you try the kiosk‚Äù I said ‚Äúno because it says right here we have to check in with a person and not online. So of course he said to go wait in that line to see.... after 10 minutes of waiting I get to the kiosk to just get told by the machine to check in with the counter. So we go to the counter desk and a huge line that we waiting in for 40 damn minutes.... after getting to someone they clearly didn‚Äôt know what they were doing because two employees just shoved us off to the next employee... some guy named Marvin in the Miami airport counter just clocked in and two employees just told him to figure it out. They were telling us that THE LADY WE SPOKE TO ON THE PHONE THIS MORNING.. did not change our ticket in the system YET we had a confirmation with seat numbers to our email. After about an hour of all this crap we finally got our tickets. I wrote a complain on the website just to get a stupid automatic message from someone named Simon who just copies and pastes fake messages and typed my name in it. I wrote her once and she just said oh sorry this happened I wrote her AGAIN with the end of the story just to get told ‚Äúwe will not be giving you compensation‚Äù I NEVER ASKED FOR COMPENSATION! All I want is for you to send the messages to who ever is in charge so they see how crap this airline is. I never have any problems with any airline BUT THIS ONE. Save your time and money because they will screw you!"
959,Never ever again. No space for the feet's. The seats at like sardiner. The service is top. But to seet 9 hours like a fish..never again. fly from LA to London
960,"Brilliant airline, took the family to Florida, they let the kids in the cockpit. Very friendly."
961,"Would like to only put 0 stars. please think twice before booking American Airlines for your travel needs, especially out of Philadelphia. On Monday 8/19/19 we had a flight that was suppose to depart at 10pm. Around 8pm (2 hours prior) we already received the first delay. This went on several times until 4:15am when they finally had us board the flight. Once boarded it was announced that it was now cancelled. My husband and I were traveling internationally with our 10 & 7 year old kids who were sleep and exhausted. I don‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt just cancel it earlier...felt strung along not knowing what‚Äôs going on from 8pm to 4:30am. If you ask them they just kept saying ‚Äúmechanical issue.‚Äù If they had made a decision earlier instead of holding us all night we could have had more options for switching and rebooking the flight. So at 4:30 am we have no idea how we are getting to LHR and the worst part was the aftermath....Dealing with AA‚Äôs ticket agents and customer service was terrible. Not only to us but to others on that flight. No comfort, no apologies, no care. Just pure rude like it was our fault. No one went above and beyond to assist us with our issue. We were talked down to and in front of our children. I mentioned to one woman that ‚Äúyou have no idea what we have been through this evening so maybe a kinder tone would help.‚Äù As we try to explain what happened they reply ‚Äú we already know your situation!‚Äù Eye Rolling, argumentive, ‚Äúthis is all we can do,‚Äù dismissive attitudes while stuck in airport. Getting the hotel vouchers we were told ‚Äúwell you can try but they will probably make you check out at 11am.‚Äù They showed that they didn‚Äôt care at all what we went though and it was not there problem. To them it happens all the time, but they should be trained to have a more understanding attitude to customers going though stuff like this. Our flight was rebooked through AA over the phone since no one at airport had a care. Marriot at the airport is where we slept and showered an waited for our rebooked flight which left 8/20/19 at 7:30pm (which also had a delay). Marriott staff were the only kind ones we dealt with. What was really crazy is we don‚Äôt even know how we got on AA. This flight was booked through Expedia and was for British Airways....British Air is who charged are card but we show up and we are actually with American who ‚Äúservices‚Äù British Air ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Although our trip was FABTABULOUS!! The start was unnecessarily a nightmare! I have contacted them and sent email and hoping they will offer something for that mess they made."
962,"My husband and I had to cancel our trip this morning for our Sept 6 flight, due to heart by-pass surgery Sept 3 that could not be avoided. The agent we talked to was most helpful, caring , and most accommodating.  As soon as my husband gets a pass from his doctors to fly, we will be calling American Airlines and booking our flight to Phoenix to see our 2 1/2-year-old grandson. Thanks so much Jan and Jerry Peterman Graham NC"
963,"I flew with American Airlines with my nana on the 1st of August for a trip to Europe to spend with a dear family friend and others. The flight itself was wonderful, smooth takeoff and  landing, friendly staff and a wonderful selection of food. I was very happy with my flight overall. However upon landing in Germany we discovered our luggage had been left in the states. After letting one of the staff know this we were told it‚Äôd be only 1 or 2 days before our luggage would be delivered to the location we were staying at.It was a full week before my nana got her luggage back and TWO MORE DAYS before I received mine, despite us both coming from the exact same place to the exact same place. We discovered that apparently our luggage was transported to France, where they discovered our location was closer to Germany so they sent it BACK to the states and THEN to Germany, instead of double checking which one would be closer they wasted time sending it back and forth. My allergy medication was in my luggage and I wound up getting sick for a few days without them. During the time we didn‚Äôt have our luggage we contacted customer support multiple times and weren‚Äôt told anything, our emails went unresponded to and our calls wouldn‚Äôt be picked up.Despite an overall wonderful flight, due to this HORRENDOUS mismanagement of our luggage I will never be flying with American Airlines ever again. Other airlines might have less comfortable seats or a more mediocre selection of in flight entertainment but none of them ever lost my luggage for over a week."
964,"American Airline is a very useless Airline,I would advice people not to even think of using this Airline.Both customer service staffs and Managers. They are all very rude and nothing good comes out of their mouths. PROUD Individuals, keep up this way and you keep losing customers."
965,If there was an option for a zero stars I would have chosen it !! This airline is a fraud . Because of them our five days vacation turned out into a nightmare ! We had a flight on August 17 to Cancun @10:10AM and they kept texting us there will be a delay because of a technical issue till 1:30PM and after boarding they deplaned the passengers claiming that the crew had timed out !! I had received a 23 texts from AA about the departure till finally we boarded @10PM !!!! 12 hours delay can any one believe it ??!!! Losing a day from our vacation and reservation at the resort . Stranded at the airport for a whole 15 hours and all they had done was giving away their crappy food and water !! Not even an apology ! The people at their counter was very rude and mean adding to the frustration of the unfortunate people who had to fly with them !! At the end all they did after complaining they gave me a $175 voucher üò° !!! I don‚Äôt want to fly with you anymore!! Will never use your crappy airlines for the rest of my life and will do my best to report you everywhere and will take it to social media and the news journal too !! I‚Äôll make sure no one else has to suffer the way you made us suffer !!
966,"Cart was slammed into my knee while sleeping after not getting upgraded as I paid. For it.  I deem this as fraud.  And negligence.  I offered to give captain and flight attendence some advice and I was met with ego, snap responses, and interuptions.  Word of advice.  Dont fall asleep and let your knee fall out. Merciless folks.  Further, small things matter especially when it comes to flying commercial airlines with hundreds of passengers on board.  Captain snaped comments back at me without listening.  Makes me wonder how he responds to correction from his first officer.  Any military person or CEO worth his salt knows this.   Also, I made sure to be very respectful and kept a very normal demeaner just to see if I would be listened to with little luck wxcept to be ushered off the plane.   If any of AA people would like to contact me, Ill be happy to share some suggestions after the fact.  If not, I will try to get a hold of the CEO.  If I can save someone else from being rammed by a cart, then Ill be willing to go as far as I have to in litigation.   I was on flight aa2049 on Miami to Dallas departing 10 pm. My advantage number is 6fde894.  Contact me if you would like."
967,"I would strongly recommend anyone planning to visit US to avoid American Airlines, charged for special meal, seating together but never delivered, cabin crew refuses to serve water, extremely unhelpful and rude check in counter employees both in UK & US, every flight delyed... third world country Air Plane services are much better than AA. Was not a pleasant journey at all."
968,"My son & friend  were booked on this flight then going to Bangor Maine. The plane was delayed due to mechanical reasons  - the pilot came out and said the flight would be delayed due to service. This was at 3:30 pm. This flight was scheduled at 4:30- they kept delaying it -  leaving almost 2 hours later. In flight I realized they were not going to make their connecting flights. I called american and they told me it was due to weather. I said, not at first it was due to service. If it was first due to service then weather, then the service should be the reason for the delay. I told her what the pilot said and she was completely rude to me saying, if it is due to weather they can not provide a hotel voucher. That 17 year olds would have to sleep in the airport.  I called back to speak to someone that would be nice to me, the woman that answered the call said ""Hi Tori"" really rudely, obviously knew about my complaint when she answered the call. She rudely explained that the skies are different than ground. There were no thunderstorms until 7pm. if they left on time at 4:30 - they would have missed the weather and wouldn't be delayed - but the service kept it delayed then delayed further due to weather. My family flies all over the country at least 6+ times a year or more and we have never been treated this way. It is obvious that using weather as a reason for the delay vs service  would benefit a business as an excuse to not accommodate a stranded passenger, however where they are 17 years old and I tried to get some kind of help and understanding, instead your two agents were rude to me - said they could do absolutely nothing for these 2 kids. AA has lost our business now- i would rather pay more for tickets from another airline, than be treated this way especially when i am trying to get options for 17 year olds. Instead was told only option was  to sleep in the airport.."
969,American Airlines have thieves working for them and their customer service is horrible. I returned home and looked in my luggage and my Louis Vuitton bag was missing. I called customer service and all i got from them was attitude. If I could give them 0 stars i would. This is not how you treat your first class passengers or any passenger as a matter of fact. I will never fly with them again and I will make sure anyone I know never flies with them.
970,"i wanted to express my experience with American Airlines this past weekend. I had the misfortune of missing my connecting flight into Palm Springs, due to a delay flight into Portland. The nice desk lady at the desk was very kind and she tried to get me another flight out, but was unsuccessful. American Airlines put me up in a nearby hotel and issued me food vouchers.. I was in AWE.....thank you for being accommodating.I shared my experience with my co-workers..."
971,Horrible service.  100% of my last 6 trips were delayed and then canceled.   The WORST airline.  Last trip was last week and I will never fly AA again.  You will not leave me stranded ever again AA!!  Also closed and canceled my AA credit card.  Hands washed.

973,"Bought first class tickets for the first time. Comfortable seats and would have been nice for the extra money we paid except for the Flight Attendants loud conversations about their life!! If I heard one more time about ""I'm a widow, have two children one in 5th grade and one in 7th grade. My daughter Liliy is doing a reading next Wednesday and I'm schefuled to work, so I'm trying change days with someone so I'm off work for the reading at a catholic school in Dallas Fort Worth. I went to a class on vacations, I taught classes, I know how to bid on jobs etc. blah blah blah"" not to mention not worrying about needs of first class customers. A man had to go up to flight attendant to ask for a cup of coffee because she was so engaged with other flight attendant in conversations. Not sure the EXTRA money was worth it! Maybe a class for flight attendants to remember to do their jobs would be appropiate."
974,"I had the unfortunate experience of having to deal with American Airlines customer service. They were condescending and only cared about charging ridiculous fees. They took a 50% change fee from my ticket!¬†However, when dealing with United Airlines for the same exact travel, I got the real help I was looking for.Buying an airline ticket is more than just getting me from A to B, it's about that peace of mind knowing that if something goes wrong they are there to help. American airlines was there to help, themselves and couldn't care less about me or my travel experience.¬†American airlines lost a customer for life and United Airlines won a customer for life."
975,"On August 1, 2019 I was traveling to Pennsylvania. I took my first flight from Los Angeles LAX to North Carolina CLT when we landed at 9pm I found out my connecting flight to Allentown, Pa ABE was canceled do to weather witch is understandable. I was booked for the next day at 10pm by the airline, what I don't understand and made me even more upsed is that, it was almost 24 hours waiting, I went to customer service to find out how to proceed just to find out that the airline wasn't going to provide accommodations because, it wasn't the Airline fault. I got put on standby for the next morning at my request, after waiting all night in the airport the next morning my standby flight was also canceled because they didn't have a crew to fly the plane, really?, there I was one more time at customer Service  asking to be in the next flight as a standby, well the it was 9am and the next available flight was for 4pm, yes! There I was waiting again spending more money on meals deprived of my sleep waiting because,  AA didn't even had the courtesy to pay for one meal even so the cancellationthis time was their fault. While waiting I saw many people in my same situation, flights canceled all AA do to the crew been late or none existing not to mention how many times they changed gates, Wow! Also customer Service should be trained on compassion and Understanding, I witnessed 2 members of customer Service making fun of a lady who was frustrated as many of us, about her cancellation. They as she left the desk, laughed and criticized her in front of me, they said she was a b...so, and continued saying, if her husband was a lawyer and has money why she bought a cheap ticket?. We are all human and handle stress different, please! Be understanding and dont make fun of them in front of the other customers. After my bad experience and the lack of support from AA I will do my best NOT to ever book another trip with AA. One of the worst airline companies out there so far..."
976,"American Airlines are stingy money making with pathetic airlines and customer service. I was flying from YYZ to JAX via CLT. my flight was at 7:15 pm and they delayed it by 15 minutes and kept doing that until 8:30pm. I went to them concerned by my connection which I would be missing. They said I would miss it indefinitely and that flight was the last flight out of CLT. They said they won‚Äôt provide me any accommodation at CLT and rebooked me for the next day same time as no other flight was available for the whole day. I wait for one entire day at the airport only to realise that my flight again at 7:15 pm was delayed to 8:30pm. When asked they said it was a mechanical issue and they had to send the plane to maintenance. Out of frustration and extensive convincing I rebooked my flight from CLT to JAX for the next day as I would again miss my connection. But my flight from Yyz kept increasing by 15 mins and finally it got delayed to 11 pm from 7pm. I finally asked them are you going to give us food vouchers as we all are hungry and tired. Instead of giving any dinner the airlines providing mere coke, water and low quality biscuits ... even after all this .. they cancelled the flight at midnight. Making me trap at Toronto airport once again. I told them to give me airport accommodation and food voucher. They rebooked me for the 6am flight and then tried to convince me that I didn‚Äôt need a hotel. However I insisted. And then they convinced me to go get a grab while the hotel voucher is getting printed. I said okay and went to grab food, when I returned back they were gone and didn‚Äôt even give me the voucher. So for the second day I‚Äôm sitting at the airport. Pathetic airlines and horrendous customer service. I will never fly with American Airlines."
977,"Aug 1st Flight AA1152 to Houston. This is the 3rd worst trip flight in my life. All three are standing out in my mind right now. All three American Airlines. The day before our flight they change the lay over from 1.5 hours to 4 hours. Sitting in this airport with a MENTAL clock countdown they delay 20 more minutes, and then an additional 45 more minutes. We have been here for almost 6 hours.Where is the reason for this? I want to know why? I sat there last time 40 minutes delay waiting on the employee to show up to work. I heard all of it."
978,VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Won't stand behind what their clerk and supervisor told me that I would get a full refund back to my cc because they couldn't get me to my destination.
979,American Airlines staffs seem angry all the time.
980,"Worst customer service ever. DC flight to Philly was 3 hours delayed. Never told us why. Missed connection to Madrid. AA did not want to put me in a hotel after I waited in line for 3 1/2 hours to see a customer service agent...one of those who yells at you. My only option was to get on a 11pm flight to Dublin. Spent 10 hours at Dublin airport. Arrived in Madrid on an Iberia flight @ 10:10 pm. Missed a day of work and surprise!!! No luggage. Had to push my train to Galicia  2 days  as I waited for luggage. AA does not want to pay for the $65 train ticket. Really? Iberia paid for the clothes I had to buy as I waited for my luggage.  I paid $1300 for that flight. American Airlines need to go out of service. They keep treating customers really bad. Don‚Äôt fly American. Any other airline is better.  What are your going to do for all the inconvenience you caused? I have been a long time AAdvantage member and only keep getting disappointed. Treat your customer better, we deserve it because we are loyal and pay a lot for our bookings."
981,"Highlights:Delayed for more than 24 hours due to aircraft malfunction, received no compensation, agent accidentally canceled my return two flights home without letting me know, policies that limited employees ability to help customers.Conclusion:As a passenger, avoid American Airlines if you could. As an employee, avoid American Airlines if you want to be treated fairly.---- Details: During my trip from New York to Madrid, nearly 5 hours after sitting in the plane, we were flying above the Atlantic when the captain announced there is a malfunction of the plane and we had to return to New York. We landed back in New York around 12:30AM. American Airlines told us they cannot find us another flight and somehow decided to have only six agents with six computers to manually re-schedule 260 passengers individually, which in itself caused all passengers to stand in line for 5 hours from 12:30 AM to 5:30AM without rest or sleep. After more than 24 hours of delay, I finally arrived in Madrid, only to find out at the airport when I was ready to fly back to New York, that my two return flights have been canceled.During the whole incident, I have probably gotten in touch with at least five different agents from various positions from American Airlines, all of which insisted they had no authority to discuss compensation and it is out of their power to help me in any way. Including referring me to someone higher up who might have the authority.This incident surfaced too many problems within American Airlines. Had their engineers did their job correctly before flight departure, we wouldn't have to only discover the plane was in no shape to fly only in the middle of the Atlantic. Had their managers tried their best to get all 260 of us onto a whole other new flight, we wouldn't have to stand for 5 hours in the middle of the night and their poor six agents didn't have to work overnight and manually rebook each of us one-by-one. Had they cared about their employee's well-being, the agent might not have made the mistake of canceling my returning flights.Had they cared about their customers, they would have offered compensations like vouchers and millages to us as Delta or Southwest did with their customers.When you fly with American Airlines you can get this sense that their employees really do not want to be where they are working at. They have this grumpiness attitude and really want to rush through anything they do, from finding you a new flight to giving you directions, to serving beverages. There was even once when I asked the flight attendant for some drinking water, she told me to go sit back at my seat because they will be serving beverages soon (note this is when the seatbelt sign was off which indicated I was free to get up from my seat, and we all know that the beverages cart only comes around for 2 times after the meal carts during the entire flight). The same request was given to JetBlue or Delta, they would give me a small water bottle to keep or at least a cup of water.If you don't have to fly American Airlines, it would be worth it to add some bucks and avoid them. There are many airline choices flying domestically or internationally. As of now, American Airline's level of service doesn't deserve to survive the market."
982,"I‚Äôve flown AA exclusively for the past 10 years but that‚Äôs changing after today‚Äôs flight. The last 4 flights I‚Äôve taken were all delayed, incrementally, anywhere from 3 to 7 hours. No one at AA will admit it, but from what I‚Äôve read online the major delays are due to union labor disputes that have been going on since February, 2019. I travel for business, I can‚Äôt afford BS excuses and constant delays and cancelled flights. And to the union workers....in addition to cargo, you have been entrusted with human lives. Step up and do the right thing."
983,"This has got to be the absolute WORST airline I have ever experienced and witnessed. Every flight that I, or my friends have had, ALWAYS had more than six delays that pushed into the next day. There was one instance where I had to stay at an airport for a layover flight, in a state I had never been to before in my life, for TWO days with no hotel or money provided for the inconvenience. You would think it could not get any worse, but it did. My friend had a flight that was delayed a total of 8 times before they finally cancelled the flight. She had sat at the airport for six hours, until 2am only for them to cancel the flight and NOT even give her a refund. If you value your money and your time DO NOT consider this airline."
984,"July 13 my flight was scheduled to leave Denver for Philadelphia at 5:30 am. Everyone boarded, captain tells us that there's a mechanical issue, not sure how long fix will take. Eventually, flight is rescheduled to depart at noon. Everyone reboards, then we are told there's a flat tire. How was that missed while the plane was sitting there an extra 6 hours? Everyone deplanes again and supposedly we will be leaving ""sometime"" that afternoon. Then the crew timed out. Next thing you know, it's scheduled to leave at 8:30pm. This was very frustrating for many people, and very little info was forthcoming. No seats were available on any other flights of course. I was very disappointed with the way the customer service reps dealt with the situation. The flight finally left at 10:30. I lost a day, sitting in DIA for 18 hours. Didn't get to Philly until 3:30 am Sunday."
985,"American Airlines has horrible service!!! My family and I flew to Kona Hawaii (flights 59, and 58). On the way there we were told that the flight had limited food items, and it would not be a sufficient amount to serve everyone. This was proven, as every item on the menu was not available. Also the flight attendants seemed bothered when asked for service/assistance. Once we arrived to Kona, we discovered that all of our new luggage was damaged (deep scapes and scratches, and a thick black tar substance that would not wipe off). I was told that I would  need to file a claim, which I did (including photos). I spoke to a supervisor named Isaac, in the baggage department of customer service. He asked that I reply to his email with photos for a second time. He stated that he would review the information and contact me with a resolution, of which he never did. I called to follow up with him, and was told that he was on another call and he'd call me right back. As of the writing of this review, Isaac still has not followed up with me. On the flight home, it was the same issue....not enough food for everyone. They did not have any of the requested items on their menu. Furthermore, the plane was nasty and it appeared that they did not clean trash left from several previous customers. I would not recommend AA."
986,Worst service I've had so far! Employees are as rude as you can imagine and they don't care about you whatsoever. They're kicking people out for no valid reason and they're violent! I encourage people to trust me on this and not waste your money on this service. Have a nice day everyone!
987,"It is not regarding my flight but the class action settlement refunding passengers for luggage fees incorrectly charged. I flew round trip to Mexico in April 2018 and submitted all the necessary and requested paperwork. I was charged twice the fee as $25.00 to depart from USA and $26.00 departing Mexico. My connection in Atlanta was cancelled and I was placed in business class into another flight to reach Fort Lauderdale instead of Miami. According to the settlement, I should get a double refund for the checked luggage, i.e. $51.00. Lawyer Benjamin Edelman was hired to make sure that all affected passengers would be fairly compensated witch is not my case and who knows about somebody else. AA is not properly represented and reflecting a very negative image for the airline world."
988,"If I could give them NO STARS I would. Our plane landed in Charlotte, NC. We were told that we could not get off bc it was drizzling and lightening.  We sat for 30 minutes. This resulted in us missing our connecting flight. The next flight wasn't available until the next morning. We were told to sleep in the airport. My husband's bag was broken. They offered him a smaller bag, drive to Atlanta airport for a bigger one, or buy another one and drive back to Charlotte for a refund. We asked for a refund for the missed flight but customer service stated that they could not resolve it there. We would have to call or go online.  This was an awful experience. We are still fighting for a refund."
989,"Flew with AA to USA in June 19. The return flight was delayed due to maintenance of the aircraft (as advised by AA customer service staff at the time) meaning we would miss our connecting flight, so had to stay an extra night in Vegas. Arrived back in Ireland over 21 hours late. Missed a days work and had to pay extra car parking, never mind extra expenses in Vegas.After contacting AA they are now saying the flight was delayed as a direct result of air traffic congestion / due to air traffic control and apologise for any misinformation I may have received. They will not offer compensation but hope that I will give them another try !!!!Extremely unhappy and will never use this airline again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
990,"Took my family on vacation to California and  flew American Airlines.  That was my first mistake.  We landed in San Francisco to discover we couldn't get our car rental (that was booked through American Airlines) because I was given incorrect information from the airlines.  Now American Airlines refuses to give a refund for the rental car we never used.   Apparently they feel they have no obligation to make things right.  Also, American Airlines contacted me the day our flight was scheduled to depart to say my family (there were 4 of us) would have to take a later flight and the next available flight wasn't until the next day.  I had the added expense for a motel and meals for my family for the night because American Airlines overbooked the flight and my family got to be the lucky ones to get bumped.   DON'T FLY WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES!1"
991,"We flew with AA last September from Las Vegas to Miami.This is a dreadful airline flight was delayed, first it was 30 minutes then it was and hour and then as the time they previously gave to board arrived it was again set back another tow an half hours....terrible customer service with no manners we were lucky that we did not have connection to meet but the amount of people trying to sort out there's with very little assistance or none from how   heated it becamethe gate crew were rude and ushered you through with stern stance of only one piece hand luggage allowed, so my small but full rucksack had to prised into my hand luggage case barely allowing the zipper to closeAirline crew were not rushed in any form and not accommodating to request of a water and took ages to respond to and come back We however arrived at our hotel at 2.am instead of the early evening we hoped, losing an evening of our honeymoonAs a complaint raised with them for the delay they offered vouchers of 100$ each so I come now to redeem these vouchers on a flight to New York BUT O My Goodness1, you have to call a high rated telephone number to book a flight, they cannot be used online2, AA call centre do not match internet flight prices so you fne flights for ¬£580.00, they have the same flight but more expensive ¬£100 more so you do not get the value you thought you would from the voucher 3, you are expected to send the voucher via post so they can verify it before the voucher is deducted from your flight, if it does not arrive (say for any postal issues) they cancel the flight or charge you again, so i have to send this from the UK to the customer services in USA.....are they in the Jurassic periodYou email customer services and they just ignore the emails  Worthless voucher for all the hassle....a trip to New York next year will now not include AA we'll stick with BA !"

993,"Hello this complaint starts on our departure date 7/3 staff was very rude to my fianc√©, myself and my 10 year old son. We got to the gate before the cut off time and was told we could not board any longer and would unfortunately have to catch another flight. Just so happen we seen another AA  staff member and she was really nice and quickly got us boarded unto the flight that we were just turned away from. Once boarded we sat for an additional 15-20 minutes causing a delay for our flight landing this was frustrating because it seems that the staff lacks communication and professionalism and for it to be a first time family trip to Houston it started off as a bad experience. What officially caused this to be a horrible experience is the cancellation of our flight leaving Houston, we were given limited options to choose from as far as getting back home which was very inconvenient as I needed to get back at work today. Now instead of a small layover I now have a 4 hour layover and had to miss work. One last thing to add from the moment the flight was cancelled up into about 3am (7 1/2) hours I held on hold and no one never picked up it was just hold music and the same music repeating over and over. I really would like to be accommodated for this trip as this was my family and I first time flying through AA and it was just a bad experience. I refuse to book with them again and would not recommend!"
994,"My son and I were scheduled to fly to Philadelphia in May, 2019.  The night before, my son came down with severe stomach flu, throwing up a dozen times in just a few hours.  Our flight was booked to leave at 6 am the next morning and there was no way my son would be able to make it.  I called AA and was told that unless his illness was critical, I would have to make the flight or lose my $800 air fare.  I stated that I was uncomfortable subjecting my son and the passengers to this flight.  I was then told that I could take my son to the gate and have him evaluated.  I couldn't believe it.  Their solution was to have me get my sick son up at 4 am, go to the airport, go through checkin and TSA, and finally get to the gate and have airline employees evaluate whether my son was too sick to fly.  I was shocked.  I chose not to subject my son to the flight, and the passengers to the stomach flu and I lost over $800 in airfare.I'm an Advantage member and I sent an email to AA about this situation.  I received an automated email stating that I would get a response back from AA within 10 days.  At the time of this review, it has been over 3 weeks, and no response.  On the outside chance someone from AA reads this and wants to resolve this, I can be reached at 602-909-0840."
995,"American Airlines is terrible and their ""customer service"" is even worse. They don't appear to read these reviews so let me just put this out there for everyone else frustrated by them:File a complaint with the DOT!!! Trust Pilot won't let me link their website but google DOT airline complaint and you'll find it. It's on the Transportation dot gov site. They keep a record and distribute monthly statistics based on complaints received. Even if it doesn't help your specific case, it will put more pressure on the airline to improve."
996,"Literally the worst airline i have ever flown with... the customer service is also a disgrace Out of 4 flights i had on this 1 trip, they messed up 3 - not only did they manage to do that and fail to sort out the correct new flight details, they also lost my suitcase and as yet ( 6 days later ) i still have no idea where it is.... When speaking to a 'supervisor' all i got was an extremely obnoxious, rude attitude and was told they could do absoloutly nothing to help me... they told me to put it on e-mail and tbey would respond in 5 days.. i needed help right there and then 1 star is 1 too many"
997,"A clean, reliable and comfortable service. My preferred international economy carrier."
998,"Out of the major US airlines (Delta, SWA, United and JetBlue are the others for the most part), I rarely fly with American.  There is a good reason for that-their service, etc. are generally quite subpar-and the reason many industrial surveys and rankings have then lower than the abysmal Frontier and Spirit-if that is even possible.  I have never been moved to review them until now-after the culmination of more than 3 months of trying to get any sort of basic resolution on a lost bag issue.  Yes, it was that bad.  In short their Central Baggage claim system is a general black hole where issue got to die without any real sort of customer service.  Here was my scenario.  A domestic connection was delayed for about an hour and a half.  Naturally during that time the passengers got limited info and the run around.  We were now in the area where connections, particularly my once a day flight from MIA to a city in Northern South America was going to be missed and basically ruin my 5 day vacation by cutting a full day out of it.  I finally coaxed info out of their generally indifferent, in my prior experience, flight staff and learned the delay was to get a new seat pilot for the asst. pilot.  Seriously.  And all this while we are stuck on a large plane at ORD waiting for a 2 hour flight in a plane that seems it could have been passed it‚Äôs prime in the 80s.  Seriously.  No screens, nothing.  Even this staffer admitted she was embarrassed by the state of this plane.Finally, we make it to MIA and I rush to where my international flight to South America is to fly and lo and behold, luckily it has not departed and I get on right around the time it was supposed to depart-no layover but OK I will get to my destination that same day sometime that same day.  So they held the plane for connections. Great.  I figure my checked bag might be a causality.  But then over the course of over an hour the pilot comes on THREE TIMES to announce that ‚Äúwe are holding the flight to ENSURE that all checked bags from connecting flights get loaded on‚Äù.  So over an hour has passed and even more since my checked bag was in the connecting plane and it is literally about 1000 ft. away on the other side of the terminal.  So we finally depart.  OK, things are fine-but this being American, naturally they are not.First, toward the front of the plane it appears a passenger is in distress and medical pros on the flight are call for.  There are none.  An hour goes by on this 2.5 hour flight.  No beverage service and no dinner service.  The flight staff are actually chatting and laughing about who knows what-well at least this alleged medical emergency doesn‚Äôt appear to be an issue anymore but still they seem indifferent as the time nears 8 pm for a flight that was supposed to leave at 5:45 pm.  All during this time naturally the first class cabin is being wined and dine by a single staffer-again this alleged medical emergency didn‚Äôt impact them just the rest of us in kennel club section!Finally, about 45 min. or so left in the flight the remaining 4 flight staff begin service.  Since there has been a long wait and I had to run to the gate, I ask for 2 cans of soda.  The rude flight attendance refuses, stating ‚ÄúI need to ensure that we have enough for everyone‚Äù even though I am a few rows from the back of the plane.  When I had booked this flight 5 months earlier, my ticket listed ‚ÄúDinner‚Äù on this international flight.  Right.  We got a box labeled ‚ÄúSnack‚Äù. It was definitely on par with what I would expect to be prison rations at a local detention center.Thus, now two miserable flights in a row with AA.  I get to my international destination and through immigration to baggage.  Guess what? Well, you know what.  My checked bag that they held the flight for well over an hour to ENSURE that ALL BAGS got loaded is not there.  It is still in MIA.  So I am now inconvenienced as well as everyone else on the flight who had to sit tight for well over an hour to ENSURE my bag got on the flight that did not.  Hilarious.  Of course as I mentioned there is just that single AA flight from MIA to my destination every day at the same time. It is a warm clime and I was smart enough to pack an extra pair of shorts, a t shirt and underwear so at least I might be fresh for part of the next day and plus it would be yet another major hassle to try to go out and buy some clothes locally and HOPE that they will be reimbursed by AA.The next morning I call AA baggage back in the US and the rep is beyond rude and seems to be taken aback that I would like to retrieve my bag and gets argumentative when I attempt to ask a series of probing questions to determine how I am going to get my bag-stupid me.  And as I expected it won‚Äôt arrive until late that night and it won‚Äôt get processed right away naturally so it will be ready for delivery the NEXT morning-so at least 36 hours without my bag.  At this point I don‚Äôt even trust them to get it delivered to me locally and am forced to inconvenience my father in law who is a local and drive back to the airport to pick it up and then I proceed to try to enjoy the remaining 3.5 days of my vacation.Shortly after back in the States I contact their Central Baggage online and start a claim.  I meticulously scan and upload every receipt, baggage tag and boarding pass both to and fro and submit via e-mail with my case # as requested.  And wait. And wait. And wait. For 3 months all the while responding about every 2-3 weeks since I can‚Äôt get a resolution from them.  All the while I keep get a response from the same agent via e-mail that they are working on and don‚Äôt worry a response/resolution should be coming any day now.  Sure-right. Again, 3 months go by.  Nothing.  Incredible customer service.  Though it probably makes sense in hindsight-I imagine a scene where the staff who process these claims are so inundated with them that the pile never abates.  Finally after 3 months I get an e-mail with-you guessed it-an apology.  Beyond hilarious.  Words are cheap.  Providing great customer service like SWA does is not but they do it anyway.  I respond to this agent in kind stating such and that all along I have been asking for real compensation.  Shortly thereafter I get a call from Central Baggage which shocks me to no end-and we have a conversation.  Naturally, she states they don‚Äôt provide cash money as compensation.  She states they will ‚Äúsnail mail‚Äù me a voucher for $50 for my troubles (so very, very kind AA!) and that it will take 2 weeks to arrive.  I state that that is a total bummer as I have an upcoming Caribbean flight with them (hoping it will be my last one-it‚Äôs a route only they run out of my somewhat major metropolitan airport) and would love to use to upgrade my seat or purchase food/drinks on flights.  She states it can be used for that but yes, it will arrive too late.  And then to my amazement, it arrives in my e-mail inbox as a $75 voucher (!) and I go online and try to upgrade my seats but once at the select tab there is no option to enter in the voucher code.  I call reservations and get a rep from the Philippines who barely speaks understandable English but eventually learn what I expected all along-that the Central Baggage agent was wrong-it can only be used for future flights (a total Catch 22 as I am trying and trying to never fly AA again).  End of story.  Thank you so much AA-your certainly have EARNED your low customer and industry ratings.  Just beyond pathetic all around."
999,"The service last night in O'hare airport was absolutely appauling, I have never came across such abrupt staff either, not even on budget airlines, ever in my life. I have arrived at the airport 3.5 hours before my flight and went straight to the ticketing machine to print my ticket as I was unable to check in online. The ticket printed saying to go to the gate and that my seat will be allocated to me at the gate. I got to the gate early and went over to the desk to ask about the seat allocation and i was told by the gentleman it will be done by his colleague soon and I should wait. I waited while all other passengers got called out, when the plane was close to its original boarding time I thought I will go to the desk and check back again. Both ladies at the desk did not even acknowledge me for a few minutes, they just stared at their computer screens like they are very busy and I am interupting them. I tried to say excuse me to get some sort of attention, one of the ladies answered abruptly to wait, not even hello or sorry, no eye contact. So i waited for almost ten minutes until i got finally asked why I was standing and waiting, I said I have not been allocated a seat yet and the other lady answered really abruptly, oh its because I havent cleared you yet, you have to wait. No explanation why I have to wait while the rest of passengers were allocated seats already, no apology whatsover, just a rude tone, no eye contact, it felt like i was a second class citizen or something. Then the rest of the passengers have started boarding and I just kept waiting and waiting with no update whatsover. Then I thought i will come to boarding gate and ask again as obviously I dont want to end up missing flight due to some mistake or something. The lady looked at my printed boarding pass without the seat allocation and told rudely that I cannot board why I even came to the gate cause I dont even have the seat, I have to wait and told me and other lady in the same situation to phisically move out of the way in a very rude manner, no explanation whatsoever again. So I kept waiting until the last passengers have boarded and it was maybe only 5 of us left. I caught staffing talking that they are holding seats for different passengers and they have to wait another 10mins to see if they show up, why some economy passengers who are not even at the airport get their seat allocated and I have to wait to board last not even knowing what is happening and will i even be able to get on or not. This was extremely stressful experience taking into account i have a connection flight to catch but no one even bothered to ask that. The whole experience was made much worse by the fact how ignorant and abrupt desk staff were, I am surprised at the lack of professionalism, it felt like I was not even treated as a human being. So they kept boarding the customers that came late and even allocated a few seats to some that were part of the group but had no seats, again how is this fair towards me? So in the end my name got finally called out together with 2 other names, of course the desk assistant did not even make an effort to pronounce the name correctly, just pronounced it half way and then made a facial expression like what is this, again no apology, did not ask how to pronounce it correctly. Out of those passengers called i came to the desk first but the lady just kept staring at the screen refusing to acknowledge me, then the rest of two passengers came trying to catch her attention, so she served them first while I continued waiting. She had my passport on her desk and shoved it in to some other customer without checking until the passenger pointed out it is not his passport. So after those two passengers hot checked I asked so what is happenening why am i still waiting. She said i will get a seat, she is allocating it right now. Her colleague was literally pointing out the seats which are left over to her and she kept checking a couple of times, are you sure i can allocate a seat to her. It just felt humiliating i was treated like this, like I am not entitled to a seat or I am a second class citizen or something cause they were still waiting for other late passengers with allocated seats. I have booked a flight back in February and how come a ticket does not automatically come with a seat, it is not my fault the airline overbooks, at least if there was some sort of apology or explanation i would be more understanding. So finally i have boarded the plane as the second last passenger and I was appauled when i past 2 empty seats on my way to my seat and then discovered the window seat next to me was empty as well. All the overhead compartments  next to it were full, i tried to find any staff member to help me out find space, there was nobody around, so other passengers helped me out luckily to find some space further down from my seat, thanks to them. I am surprised there was not even a single flight attendant anywhere near checking and offering help, on any budget airline they seem always on hand. The whole experience was terrible how do they even think it is ok to treat peolle like this, peolle actually go on holidays to enjoy their time and they just ruin your whole experience by trying to save money by overbooking flights hoping someone will not be able to make it. The communication and the manners of staff need a lot and a lot of improvement, i could not imagine this sort of abrupt behaviour from any airline in europe. I would never choose to travel with them again nor would recommend it to someone."
1000,The worst airlines .I have the most bad experience fligthing for american airlineseverything was wrong They change city and time suposse to be land .The service in airplan was really poor
1001,"I go out to the US once a year to visit family, usually with Delta or Virgin.  Despite me booking a Virgin ticket the online agent rang to say that offer had expired but he could offer me a ticket at the same price to fly with American Airlines.I believe in sticking with something I know but there were no flights at a similar cost with other airlines so I accepted the offer.On the morning of my flight I received notification there was a 2.5 hour delay and I was offered an alternative connecting flight which would get me to my final destination around 2 hours later than originally scheduled.When I got to LHR the departure gate wasn't known so I got a coffee believing I had an hour or so before boarding.  Ten minutes later the gate number appeared and shortly after it showed the flight to be boarding.  I panicked believing the departure had been brought forward and dashed to the gate.  When I got there I was herded in to a room, like cattle, where I stood with all the other passengers for an hour and 20 minutes before actually boarding! Once on the plane it was announced there was a short delay as the  meals were still being loaded.  Almost 40 minutes from the original departure time we finally took off.Upon arriving at my connecting airport the captain announced there was no gate available so we must remain on the tarmac, which we did for another 50 minutes.By the time I had cleared immigration, transferred to another terminal and gone through security, ran the concourse as fast as I was able to, I had missed my connecting flight and was offered an alternative.  I eventually arrived at my destination 4 hours later than scheduled.This I put down to experience but I could not have foreseen I would have the same encounter trying to get back to the UK.  Once again a delayed flight left me being offered an alternative which would mean a six hour wait at Dallas airport.  As it turned out the alternative flight was also delayed by a couple of hours!  I had opted to fly to Chicago instead which meant I could spend a bit longer with my family and have a two hour layover before my 23.30 flight to Heathrow.  BUT the Chicago flight was also delayed creeping up by 20 minutes a time until it was now 1 hour 38 minutes delayed.  I received a notification that I may miss my connecting flight to Heathrow so approached the gate assistant.He offered me a flight the following day, which would have meant sleeping at Chicago airport!  Long story short I arrived at Chicago with 20 minutes to spare and had to run the concourse through most L gates to gate K12. I got there with 5 minutes to spare and was one of the last to board.  15 minutes after actual take off time an announcement by the captain informed us pallets were still being loaded and we would depart as soon as possible.  We eventually took off some 40 minutes late.  I arrived at Heathrow 5 hours later than my original ticket, and as a result incurred parking fees.I am sixty one years of age and I do not want or expect to have to run the length of a concourse or sleep at an airport due to such an incompetent company, who it seems from other reviews use weather as an excuse.  In 10 years of travelling with other airlines this has never been an issue and I have never arrived late or had to be offered a later connecting flight.  I've always had time to relax, have a coffee and make the original flight I booked.  In future I will pay the additional ¬£200 rather than book a 'bargain' ticket with American Airlines!Interestingly I observed on arrival and departure a huge stack of bags at the AA collection office that had made it to the destination before the owners so delayed flights must be par for the course."
1002,American Airlines customer service is a good service provider and it provides customer helpline number and they are given good facilities. American airline worker is time to time complete the work and American airlines are airlines of the US.
1003,They Don‚Äôt Even Deserve One Star At All. Very Bad Service Bad Old Planes. Don‚Äôt  waste Your Money With This Stupid AA Airlines. Not Recommended At All üëéüèª
1004,"Every airline has good and bad days, so a single experience is not a fair assessment of an individual nor an airline. With that said, American Airlines continues to lower the bar for sub-mediocrity. Flights are constantly delayed because of logistics, not weather. Staff are more concerned about themselves than they are for the customers (us travelers). Gate agents might as well be nonexistent as they cannot make use of basic microphones, nor do they seem to understand how to keep boarding orderly (I am Platinum and often end up boarding with other groups and general boarding). Yes, I know how that sounds, but when the ‚Äúrewards‚Äù program is so bad, the most we business travelers can hope for is getting on soon enough to place our small carry-on near us in the overhead compartment. I would say that AA suffers most with logistics and operations, with no real commitment to remedy the situation given current leadership.  I have had flights diverted to get pilot, crews, and planes to other regions. I experienced excessive delays and cancellations due to pilots timing out (not legally allowed to fly more hours). I have flown airlines in developing nations that exhibited more competence, professionalism, and ability to manage basic logistics than the ‚Äúpride of America...American Airlines.‚ÄùPersonally, I recommend Delta, or dare I say United, over AA, but that is like picking the least worse of a sad lot (best of the worst)."
1005,I thought American Airlines was a reputable company after this disgraceful reply to my complaint  from your customer Services agent Leanne Cory I will never fly with American Airlines again I am registered disabled and to be subjected to a seat that was so confined as my previous email as below I reiterate I had water on my table the person in front decided to recline her seat that then spilt the water over my track suit on complaining to the steward they moved her to a more comfortable seat I said I have back and leg problems cannot sit in this confined seat was told cannot do anything I had to stand up most of the flight in a lot of pain when my kosher meal arrived due to the space I could not eat it sitting so asked a stewardess if I could eat it at the Galley she said yes as I started to eat my meal another stewardess asked me to move away as needed to get to the galley unit when she finished she picked up my meal and threw it in the bin I again complained to head steward who apologised and said she thought it had been left
1006,"I would prefer to rate American Airlines as zero. Flight delayed first leg 8 hours and stayed on plane for 2 of those, apps etc stated on time, called American to change connecting flight and they were not very helpful or accommodating. Same thing happened on return flight only this time they told me I had to wait two days to leave, phone call kept disconnecting, on hold for hours. Finally after 4 calls speaking to several different representatives a helpful person answered the phone and found a solution by sending me part of way with different airlines. Will never fly with them again."
1007,"After the 'merger' with US Airways, AA has steadily cut down on the benefits for 'Loyalty' - at least as far as ordinary cardmember programs go.  we used to get a yearly discount for 2 companions on a (family) trip- now only one with 'strings' attached.  i just learned that if my spouse buys the ticket on her card (my account) they make her pay for her bags... shame.  on the other hand, they have improved the agent service at check-in at our local airport, and most recently i have found the seats more comfortable with more leg room."
1008,"Flight AA1844 was delayed for 3hours 44 mins on the 10June, which causing me to miss my connecting flight to London. Replacement flight has been arranged but it is two further connecting flights in stead of my orinigal direct flight from Pheonix to London. Flight from Pheonix delayed for another 1hour 4 mins. And I arrived in the UK 8 hours later than i orginally planned. In additional to that my bag was delayed and i still havent got my bag until today 12June Ôºàwhich is 2 days after my flightÔºâÔºÅ."
1009,Can I give less than one star here.  To delayed flights and outright cancelled flights this airline had no customer service and just didn't care if we got home.  They are an unethical horrible airline and I hope they change their name to anti-American airlines soon so everyone else can see the garbage they sell.  If you have an option to use another airline and even if it costs more please trust me that you need to exercise any other option than American Airlines.  They should be ashamed of how we were treated and I can't stress enough that you should find another airline to use.
1010,Justin Prater flew from Palm Springs to OKC due to funeral needed to change flight from June 18 to June 8 Wilma said she waived the $200 but would cost extra $125 BUT then just a few minutes later it changed to $369 which made me EXTREMELY disappointed that it changed within a few minutes. So very very disappointing
1011,"The process of getting tickets, boarding passes and check in, using the app is awesome. No hassle, no paperwork..Also they provided wheelchair service at every stop."
1012,"In getting a phone call that my father was passing, we immediately purchased tickets with American Airlines. Flight leaving at 6 am.  In getting to the airport 2 hours early in Chattanooga (very small airport) we checked in and received our boarding passes. The security lines were backed out the door. we were in the security line 1.5 hours and when getting to the plane (10 minutes prior to take off) they turned the sign to closed when they seen we were running to the flight. not only was it VERY IMPORTANT we make this flight, 6 other passengers were in the same boat. they had not even removed the landing gear from the plane and they would not let us on. 3 of the 6 passengers flying had EMERGENCY PURCHASED TICKETS (that cost extra) and they knew we were in the airport. NOT 1 ""last call"" was done on the flight over the intercom making anyone aware of the flight closing. After the employee's NOT EVEN making an attempt to help, they sent us back down to the counter to reschedule the flight. We were to get on the next flight at 2pm. making sure we were back up at the gate in plenty of time. this flight was overbooked and they would not let us board as they stated, this wasn't our ORIGINAL flight and we were only on standby. (which was also not stated to us) We now have my father passing away and getting phone calls that he only has hours to live remaining and American Airlines would do nothing for me to assist in any help. The 4:30 pm flight arrived at 4:45 and we finally were able to board. In getting on the plane and pulling 3 feet away from the landing gear, the pilot announced that we received instructions that there was a small fire on the runway but it would be only a 20 minute delay and he would make up the time in the air. 2 hours later, we were still sitting in the same place. many passengers asked for them to pull back up to the landing gear and let them re book another flight, but we were told no. In landing in Dallas, the update on my remaining flight stated that it was delayed. We looked at our boarding pass and seen we needed to go 40 Gates, to the plane. WE RAN THE WHOLE WAY. getting there we were told that it was reassigned to gate 40, (which we came from 35) WE RAN AGAIN. (both of us over the age of 50) when arriving there, this flight was closed. WE MISSED IT!!!! 4 flights in one day. looking at the time, it wasn't even the delayed time stated. The clerk looked us up, and stated we were no longer on that flight, they re booked us BACK to Chattanooga (where we JUST came from) MY FATHER WAS DYING, i purchased EMERGENCY TICKETS and they re booked me back to Chattanooga. Stating every plane was overbooked except Chattanooga and they had no way of getting me to Rapid City. Not one employee tried redirecting me to help get me there. Other people standing around were doing everything they could in trying to find us a flight, but the American Airlines Employees did nothing. this is not the end of this nightmare, but the moral of this is American Airlines is not even trying to remedy the issue, and We missed saying goodbye to my father before he passed. American Airlines Corporate Office will not answer the phones, and i can not get a hold of anyone. But, the clerk told me i had to pay for the flight to Dallas we took. American Airlines has not only made this 16 hour day horrible, but they did nothing to try to make us think they even cared what was happening. In reading all the other reviews, it seems to be the normal thing for them to do. As i will NEVER get the time back from missing my fathers funeral, I will do EVERYTHING in my power to let every person i know, hear about my experience with them. And this will be the LAST TIME i ever fly with them."
1013,"If there is less than zero star, I'd have chosen it. Terrible airline. Never departs or arrives on time. Prepare for sleep over at airports."
1014,"Every single time I try an fly American Airlines, My flight get cancelled and rebooked and cancelled again at least 4 times, resulting in my missing extremely important events which were the whole reason I was flying to begin with. I have literally never taken an American Airlines flight that was not cancelled multiple times after 4 plus hours of delays first. I missed my grandmother's funeral in July, and missed half of my vacation and a religious holiday planned with my family last month. American Airlines never offered lodging even though both times our flights were cancelled and not rebooked until the following day. American has also not gotten back to me after multiple official refund requests for tickets and seat upgrades on flights I NEVER TOOK. They really need to their stuff together before they run themselves into the ground. For a major airline to have such horrible logistics issues is embarrassing, and for them to not make any effort to even respond to refund requests is even worse. I have now spent over $3,000 on booking tickets through anotehr airline, rebooking, baggage fees, overnight stays at hotels and rental cards I should not have had to spend if my flights would have just taken off as planned. Oh and missing my grandmothers funeral after paying $3k for those plane tickets alone is not fun either. I plan to put this review on every single forum I can until they respond to my refund requests. DON'T FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES!!!"
1015,"TERRIBLE,TERRIBLE. WE WERE JUST TRAVELING FROM VEGAS TO MEMPHIS,TN. OUR FLIGHT WAS DELAYED SEVERAL TIMES WITHIN MINUTES OF DEPARTURE. WE FINALLY GOT A PLANE OUT WHICH DROPPED US IN PHOENIX,ARIZONA APRIL 29,2019. WAS TO FLY FROM PHOENIX TO MEMPHIS ON THE 29TH. THE PLANE WE WERE TO ABOARD TOOK OFF MINUTES BEFORE WE ARRIVED. LEAVING MORE THAN 26 PASSENGERS SCRAMBLING TO GET HOME .CITING THE WEATHER. RAIN.....THEY THEN RUDELY GOT US(5 CELEBRATING OUR COUSIN 50TH IN VEGAS) ON A NEXT DAY FLIGHT OUT AT 6:50 PM. TOLD US THATS ALL THEY HAVE AND HANDED US A DISCOUNT INSTRUCTION SHEET. WHEREAS IT WASNT A DISCOUNT BECAUSE PRICELINE FOR THE SAME HORRIBLE  2  STAR HOTEL WAS LISTING CHEAPER RATES. ALSO TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE UNDER AA.COM.  THEY DIDNT OFFER ANYTHING BUT COSTED US WELL OVER $239 IN HOTEL FEES PLUS HOURS OFF OF MY PAYCHECK FOR NOT SHOWING UP FOR WORK THE NEXT DAY BUT STUCK IN PHOENIX,ARIZONA. THIS SUCKS YOU CAN INCONVENIENCE  THE PASSENGERS YET YOU DONT HAVE TO COMPENSATE US IS CRUEL.AMERICAN AIRLINES IS ALWAYS CHANGING DEPARTURE TIMES. DO NOT FLY THERE FRIENDLY SKIES.-MR.SIP."
1016,This Airline took away my daughter and grandchildren's seats that I had booked months ahead and gave them to other people and made them wait for seats at the gate! This company is outrageous and I will never use them again!
1017,"0 star option! 1* because that's the lowest. Dont use them, unless you WANT to have issues with your flights! They are as useful as bird crap on your windscreen. I wish i had never used this airline. Flights was delayed first due to a mechanical issue, so was fine with a short delay. Later, the pilot couldn't land because it was raining! Wow what a great excuse to f things up. I raised my concerns about connecting flight but do AA give a dam? No! We're they helpful in anyway...NO. missed our connecting flight and no options given... take a flight 48hrs later was only thing offered. Their customer service doesn't,  exist. Never will use this airline again, low budget airline operate better. Made an official complaint with AA but that probably another waste of my time. Thank you AA for being so useless!!!!"
1018,"So polite and kind. My inbound trip from UK to Chicago was excellent.My Flight from Memphis to Chicago was even better. Hostess was generous, welcoming and kind. Very impressed. I can‚Äôt say the same for Norwegian on the way back because they were absolutely appalling. AA have won a new customer. Thankyou."
1019,"As I am writing this I am sitting in LAX American airlines has been the low point of my family's trip. My flight to LAX was delayed, and we had to race to get to our connecting flight back to Boston. Even though they had radioed to let the gate know we where on the way they would not let us board or hold the gate for even a minute even though it was thier fault we were late. When we went to customer service we where informed they could get us on another airline, but only if we where advantage status customers.  Because we where just regular customers we would not be able to fly out until the morning. The 2 girls at the customer service area ar LAX had the personality of soulless automatons. The experience flying with American has been hot garbage from the lack of just commonly decent politeness to the barrage of ads and flyers handed out by the flight crew to sign up for thier credit card. Needless to say my next flight will not be with this airline, as they are so fond of reminding me during this trip I do have a choice in airlines."
1020,The aa representatives at the counter in Dallas Fort Worth questioned my husband about his handicap (an artificial right ankle) walking to the plane the pilot stops my husband as I‚Äôm rolling our bags to the plane. The pilot proceeds to tell my husband that he was rude to the counter representative because he said he had been herded like an animal for over 10 hours at the Raleigh airport! So I stop an wait thinking ü§î the conversation is over the pilot got nasty with my husband trying to cause an argument to keep him off the over booked flight! He ask all sorts of questions he had no right saying anything to my husband nor myself he ask my husband why I was standing their an if we were together as if he wanted to say something rude to me but I just quietly told waiting! The pilot proceeded to walk on board ahead of us an told two stewards to be aware an warned them that my husband had a bad attitude an to watch him! This airline is shameful an rude the flight was not so bad as the American Airlines pilot that assumed he was at the circus herding animals a choose to pick on a disabled veteran! American Airlines you‚Äôve lost your way an the customer service is obsolete!!!! RUDE RUDE RUDE PILOT MISSED HIS CALLING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòêüëã. AA has lost my future business! Uncalled for an disrespectful did I say we have a cardiologist appointment tomorrow morning at 9am an the pilot was being petty toward my husband! AA flight 2347 April 15th at 10:40pm dfw to cos
1021,"Horrible experience This is the second time I have experienced horrible service through American Airlines. Long story short: arrived at St. Louis airport to be told my flight had been changed to Wednesday April 17th and there was nothing they could do. As I'm trying to explain to the lady I could not stay here for another two days she rudely cuts me off and says there's nothing she could do. All airlines are booked. She never looked or tried to provide any additional assistance. I then stated, I need my money back. How is this fair to customers to arrive the day of their flight to be told last minute come back there is no flights. She then states, waving to the next customer to come up, call some number. I then walked over to Delta next door and had a totally different experience. The two ladies there explained they have had an overwhelmingly amount customers coming over with the same complaint and would try their best to get me a flight. GREAT customer service! They were unable to get me a flight all the way home but called around and found a flight through Southwest. Something American Airlines should of done. So as of now I'm getting the run around about my 500 dollar ticket after I had to purchase a last minute 600 dollar ticket through Southwest. I would advise anyone using American Airlines to think twice! They are overbooking flights with very few planes causing unnecessary problems with passengers. Once they get your money they could care less about anything else!"
1022,"Flying with kids is hard enough. Every mom knows that but American Airlines certainly made it harder. After flying solo with my baby I can say that this is the worst airline I have ever flew on, and I have nothing good to say about it. It was absolutely terrible. I had to rush (literally run, holding my son, across the airport) after finding out (20min later) that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get his carseat & stroller frame. It was 11pm, our third flight and everyone was already inside the plane. I was the last person to board. The whole staff was rude, and the agent told me that I should arrive earlier next time (really?) Let me just say that if they weren‚Äôt so incompetent I would be on time. I was assured the carseat and base would be at the gate when I got there and guess what? It wasn‚Äôt. The carseat was missing, I no longer had the tags and to make even worse, they gave my seat away. ü§Ø The gate agent, was incredibly rude, and it took everything out of me to keep calm as he was yelling saying that I was delaying the flight and he was going to send the bill to my house. Excuse me. I thought. It was hard to believe. I was trying to make sure they would find the carseat as I was about to leave the country. Another team member interfered but wasn‚Äôt helpful. I was tired, I had tears coming down my face as I walked back to my seat. AA customer service was cold, uncaring and inconsiderate. I arrived at my final destination without a carseat. Not the vacation I planned. They haven‚Äôt founded the carseat and I am beyond disappointed. All they can tell me at this point is ‚Äúyou have to wait‚Äù. Staff attitude, is frankly unacceptable."
1023,"4/2/19 Flight delayed for 5 hours to DR. 4/9/19 Returning flight to CLT. delayed for 3 hours, connecting flight to Orlando cancelled!!! Supposed to land in Orlando at 10:15 pm. Sent to  Philadelphia at 1:00 am next day. Not dressed for Philly's weather. Checked luggage left in Charlotte with all personal items. All shops, dining closed at Philadelphia PA airport.

Lost additional day from work.AA non-customer service cold, uncaring and inconsiderate. Flight home ruined the great vacation I had. Will never fly American Airlines again!!"
1024,Never will fly American Airlines again.
1025,"Anerican Airlines is by far the worst airline, I received an email 4 days into my vacation saying my upcoming departure flight  got changed from  an afternoon flight  to a very early morning flight. But wait It gets better.  I get on the plane eventually they mske the announcement the plane has low oil,  he compared it  to a car not having enough oil, so  a half hour go by then another They make an announcement there  is an oil leak so they  deplaned everyone. They put us on another plane coming from an international flight. We wait until they clean the plane.  I get on that plane, again were waiting and waiting  they finally make an announcement there has been a bird strike. At that point I volunteered to get off the plane . Before i could get off the plane they made an announcement once  again they deplaned everyone. They ended up canceling  that entire flight. I talked to customer relations about this crazy frustrating experience they feel this is normal. They will send you a  prewritten email to fit  what ever scenario your experiencing.   This airline is a joke. They lost my business!!!"
1026,"The worst airlines I have ever flew on, there is nothing to say good about flying with them. Can't believe people keep coming back, it's like doing the same thing over and over and expecting differ results. Wake up Americans quit paying to be sh t up on"
1027,"Never again this is the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had, mine was booked through a travel agent, flying from Miami to Heathrow AP, as I‚Äôm disabled & in a wheel chair I was wheeled to the flight door my husband & friends where behind a bit, the stewardess was at the door she just stood & watched as I tried to struggle getting out of the wheelchair then told me my seat was on row 26, I‚Äôm on Oxygen & have metal plates in my leg Nearve damage left me with a bad shake in my leg, I struggled to get to row 26 only to find I was in middle of the row, I told them I couldn‚Äôt sit in the middle but was told just to bend my leg & get in, told her I can‚Äôt bend my leg so ok just sit on the isle seat, 2 minutes later a rather rude lady came & told me that was her seat she seen the way I was, but I had to struggle to the middle seat, by this time I was in tears, & my husband was having a shouting match with the stewardess about the way I was left, eventually I was moved to a front seat as the plain was half empty, I‚Äôve never felt so degraded in my life it‚Äôs bad enough being disabled but to be treated like this is terrible Anyone being disabled will know this, hate this Airline would never recommend AA to anyone worst ever experience on a flight every thing about this airline is hateful"
1028,"I should start by saying that the in-flight staff was lovely and made things much better, so this was a big positive for American Airlines. However, both the booking and the airport experiences could hardly be worse than they were. First of all, I bought tickets through British Airways but my flight got canceled 2 days prior to the date and we simply received an email saying ""we are sorry to inform that your flight got canceled"". I then called BA and got moved to the AA flight but, when I received my boarding passes, I noticed we were not flying together (my partner and I), even though we booked and checked-in together. I called AA to try and change it but the rude customer assistant said that we would have to pay at least 68 pounds per person to sit together, as these were the only seats available - in the same class! 136 pounds is one third of the flight ticket price, so that's really not reasonable. She then told me to try the airport, where they normally can change it for free.Arriving there, the rude customer representative dismissed us completely and said that there was nothing he can do. When I explained the situation, said that we were on a honeymoon and that we always sit together when we buy together, he snapped and said ""This is a business, if you want something, you have to paid for it"". Absolutely horrendous customer service, so offensive, so rude and lacking any kind of empathy for the customers - or something worse, when he looked at two men married to each other, which set the tone from then on.Even with the good experience on-board, I don't think I will be considering AA in the future, I will probably go after another airline where people are more friendly and respectful, and somewhere where they don't try to overcharge for seats from the same class."
1029,"The curious seating system at American Airlines has been described by thepointsguy.com. For our outbound trip, from Heathrow to Los Angeles the system was as described here. For our return trip (March 22, AA136, 8.35 p.m., code ZPWKON) this was even worse.The seating map did not ‚Äùopen up‚Äù 24 hour prior to take-off, different computers, with or without cookies did not matter. Multiple tries resulted at first, in no seating at all, after a while two seats not beside each other were reserved. This seating was impossible to change or cancel. At check-in (LAX, terminal 4, ca. 1230-1 p.m.) a rude assistant was not interested to hear about this, nor offer any help other than saying we should negotiate the seating at the gate, indicating that when flying economy we should expect nothing better. Fortunately, a mute customer assistant on the 2nd floor managed to change seating.When you have bought an air trip, you should be informed if there any fees for check-in baggage and what fees are for normal (under the overweight limit) baggage. This is not the case for American Airlines, no such information appeared. It turned out that the baggage fees amounted to 230 $ for both trips adding 31 % to the total cost. This is certainly something one would take into consideration, should you consider American Airlines for your next flight. However, I will not do such a consideration."
1030,"Never ever fly with American worst flight experience ever had . Never use them again . Flights was delayed for no reason. They didn‚Äôt tell us why. I‚Äôm sitting on the plane as I write this.  We have a child on the plane with us. This is terrible for a child to sit for 2 hours. I‚Äôm not exaggerating either. Staff was rude to me. Telling us to make sure to keep our daughter in her seat. I can control my child but after two hours of sitting was terrible. They don‚Äôt have power on the plane for electronics. So my power was completely drained. WiFi doesn‚Äôt work, and they had tv‚Äùs didn‚Äôt work either.  I really would reconsider before using .  Seriously, because they do not care about their passengers"
1031,"This airline is absolutely terrible. I flew from the UK to USA return Heathrow to JFK. Even from the beginning the old hags working at the AA customer service desk at Heathrow were rude and unhelpful. It didn't get better from there. My wife and I paid extra on the first leg of the trip for complimentary drinks and extra leg room. DON'T DO THIS it's a waste of money. The leg room in the normal seats is adequate I'm 6ft, and there was no complimentary drinks service. You get one free drink with your meal and that's it, just like everyone else, so what was I paying extra for? When I politely asked for a beer one of the flight attendants flat out said no and pretty much told me to wind my neck in. I was astonished that this is how the cabin crew treat their customers. It was more of the same on the return leg where the staff at the bag drop at New Orleans Intl were loudly complaining about how terrible their jobs were while doing absolutely nothing, they weren't busy and had no customers to serve. How unprofessional. Then the flight attendants were equally rude on the return leg but took a disliking to a group of Germans instead of me and proceeded to argue with them over a can of beer. Nobody from their party was drunk or rude, the gentleman only asked for a can of beer. This and further miscommunications on the cabin crews part, lots of eye rolling towards their customers and a general lack of professionalism made this an experience to forget. AA is a truly awful airline, the only saving grace is that I wasn't delayed and had no missing luggage but this should be a given not a win. ALL your staff need to be trained in customer relations, because their attitude, it's frankly unacceptable. They have no concept of common courtesy, and this is how they treat service personnel, they should be ashamed of themselves. I will never fly AA again and I will let everyone know about it."
1032,"First flight with AA and it was heaps of good service, will use again"
1033,"In the world there are over 400 airlines and people are able to recognize most of them or have heard their names at least once. But while most of the American airlines Phone Number are well known to the general public, the name of this top secret airline doesn‚Äôt ring a bell to almost anyone. The appearance of the aircraft of JANET might not cause any suspicion at first. They are white planes with a single simple red line along them. Six of the planes are Boeing 737-600, which are still used in commercial traveling. Resource URL: american.airlines-customerservice.com/"
1034,I have just returned from a trip to the States and booked premium economy both ways.  When I checked in at Charleston airport yesterday afternoon I was given a seat in economy.  When I queried this at Philadelphia I was told that when I booked my flight there were no premium economy flights available on that day.  This is absolutely untrue as I had booked a premium economy return ticket from Manchester to Charleston (via Philadelphia) and back to Manchester.  I believe that the plane I was originally booked on was changed and therefore there weren't enough premium economy seats.  It was a very frustrating and disappointing experience at the information desk yesterday in Philadelphia.  The other issue is that I booked this flight via British Airways but hadn't realised the carrier was American Airlines.  I think if you are partners you need to have better communication between the two organisations which was clearly lacking yesterday.
1035,Awful service from the company and the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever been whilst on an aircraft so dated! Screaming baby behind which I understand will happen but maybe have a back section for children and parents as whole experience as a whole was a nightmare will avoid and avoid again
1036,"Checking any extra 100 g of your luggage and ask for 15 usd extra (so it is for a kilo even if you have less). Most of the companies allow to carry 23 kg, this one is 20 only! On the plane prepare to stay without food and with simple choice of drinks.But the worst part, prepare to sit separate from your family members (far away) if you do not pay for the sits. Not using anymore."
1037,I had to fly home on a moments notice for a funeral.  I needed to change my flight home due to a snow storm that will hit Sunday evening.  I was trying to leave early to help solve the issues of flight delays and cancellations. AA was not willing to change my flight to an earlier time so that I could get home early.  The customer service was terrible.  I believe I spoke with Sonia.  Without any compassion she simply told me I would need to buy a $500 one way flight.  I will never fly with this airline again.
1038,"I didn't really want to give these 1 star as I don't think they deserve even that. We had a flight delay from San Juan and they said we wouldn't make our connecting flight in Philly. However we were rushed on to the plane in Philly and were assured our bags would be on the plane. They were not and 4 days later we are all being told different stories and lies as far as I'm concerned. Even though I have said we have medication that we need. No updates on their dedicated lost baggage web site, so what is the point of that. Absolutely shocking customer service from a company I will avoid at all costs in the future.  I was also treated shockingly by a member of staff on the plane, so bad that a colleague had to apologise for her. No one should be customer facing with her attitude."
1039,"I am actually quite happy with them. Okay flight fares, okay service."
1040,Terrible. Your crew is very unprofessional.
1041,Service Completely sucked terrible experience spoke with supervisor Eric who literally told me customers are usually wrong! I had a flight over all star wknd which connected in Charlotte I inquired if there would be a problem boarding there since seat & flight were already reserved / paid for connected in Charlotte.  AA Told me absolutely not if I wanted board in Charlotte on same flight & seat I already paid for would be $700 extra??? Wow
1042,The flight out of BOSTON was 1 hr 15 mins late. We missed our connectin to key west. We had a 5day vacation now 4 days. We pay for the room in the Keys even though we won‚Äôt be there. No offer of ANY kind to assist. Maintain your plane of get out of business.
1043,Terrrible terrible airline. They switched my flight to a connecting flight without warning when I bought a direct flight. Super inconvenient. I will never fly them again. I rather walk to my destination. Or take frontier airlines.
1044,"I had been a loyal member of American Airlines for a long time, but since last year their customer service is the worse, I had a really horrible experience in my last trip, they first announced a delay of the flight of over three hours, then they changed and made us board the plane, when we were taxi for departure they just stop the plane and said we have to stay over three hours waiting for the airport control to let us take off, why push us into the plane, and then held us hostage for that extended period of time, each time they just cancels the flights without any information or empathy for their customers. During all the time we were waiting in the plane no water or anything was offered, one of the worse experiences ever.This isn't the first time the do something like that, one time they got me flying cross country they for at the end never arrive to my destination. What is wrong with you AA?"
1045,"Another horrible experience with American Airlines.  We purchased a ticket last February for our nephews graduation in Indiana.  We were unable to use the ticket and were told by a representative of American Airlines that we had to schedule travel by the end of February 2019 or we would lose the ticket.  In addition, there was a $250 change fee for a ticket that cost a total of $456, so we only had a credit of $216.  We called this past weekend to schedule a flight for July, and were told by the representative that if travel did not start by 2/27/2019, the credit can not be used.  They suggested we contact Customer Relations as they have extended credits in the past.  We contacted them, and were told they are declining our as they are following policy.  Never addressed our comments about the first representative giving us misinformation.In short, we gave American $456.10 and received nothing in return.  Still wondering how customer's money can expire at any airline."
1046,"American Airlines change policy is ridiculous.  I paid $885. for a flight, my plans changed and I needed to get out one day earlier.  domestic flight.  they wanted to charge me more than my original fare to do so.  I checked...there are plenty of seats on the alternate earlier flight.  No wonder Southwest Air is the rated the best in the world."
1047,American Airlines overpriced too much for baggage and flights
1048,"There is nothing wrong with the flight itself onces it is in the air. You do not have your own entertaiment but for a short flight no problem. The leather seats are ok. Just the service when something goes wrong is very bad, rude and full off lies mostly towards Europeans but as I now learned most Americans dislike the service also. They can get away with that because laws do not apply to Europeans or when your connecting flight is with another airline they have no obligation to help you. So they treat you in a discrimitive way. I was 3 feb 2019 flying AA from San Juan to Miami and had 4 hour window to transfer to KLM dutch royal airline to Amsterdam. In San Juan the door of the airplane was broken which caused a 4 hour delay. They took no responsability for the missed connecting. They would not tell me where i can find a klm or air france representative to change my flight. They just ignored me at first and said as a European flying another airline I had no rights and they called KLM a cheap airline omg!!!! They fly the royal family...that is why it is called royal. Around the broken door they kept the seats free so there where too many people for the plane. AA asked for volunteers to stay an extra night in San Juan, your flight would be changed to next day, you would get 600 dollar and a hotel. Almost nobody wanted that some customers were just mad`and screaming. I volunteered and was verbaly excepted to this deal and just in line for paperwork. When i got to the desk in 5 min they took the deal, i was already accepted for, off the table. They said they had no seats to Miami on 4th feb either...I did not except this situation. Then suddenly the lady does gives me a seat for 4 feb and I can even pick a chair. She books me a hotel but refuses to pay the promised 600 dollar and she refuses too take my suitcase off the plane. Changing the missed KLM flight costed me 150 euro and the 'cheap' airlines did that in a 5 min phonecall (some light at the end of the Kafka tunnel). This is what i call customer service which at AA does not excist. So I was in a noisy hotel in San Juan with no clean clothes, no toothbrush, Deo or even a Camb...paying for the changed klm flight, food, extra day off and non off the promised compensation that was publicly announced for everyone to hear. I highly recommend any European not to fly with this airline unless you have no other choice. Technical problems and delays are frequent. The rules and laws for compensation or help do not apply for us. Therefore the airline thinks it has a free pass at discriminating us and treating us in a very bad way. The take no moral responsability for anything."
1049,"I made a reservation for my daughter who is in college,  so she can fly back home to go see a specialist.   Unfortunately I made a reservation without knowing that she will have an exam on the day of travel.   I called the airline to try and reschedule her flight for another day,  but I was turned down.   I explained the situation to them about her being a student and she has to be seen by a doctor here because my insurance is not accepted in the state that she is in.  I was told that unfortunately we cannot change,  refund or give you credit towards any future travel on American Airlines.   They completely refused to help me in any kind of way what so ever.   The person who I was speaking with basically said consider your ticket as a donation to American Airlines.   I told her I am not asking you to change the ticket free of charge I know that there's a difference that would have to pay,  but again I was turned down.   American Airlines by far is the worst airline that you can fly and deal with.   They don't care about anything other than themselves and the money that is going into their pockets.   Very disappointed with how they handled this situation.   Never again would I ever book a flight with this ridiculous airline."
1050,"Recently i visted Jamaica  January 15, ti be exact and i had the good fortunate of having Agent Kurt at the Montego Bay counter checked me in. It  was one of the most thoroygh, knowledgeable customer service i had experienced in a long time. Not only did he show an eagerness to help, he made sure that we made the flight. I had to do a last minute switch to change my husband from another airline to AA. It was a connecting flight so he tried to get us sests beside each other on every leg . And after we left. He came to the boarding area to make sure we get  the change of seats and made boarding since we were late.  Kudos to him, i will always fly AA to Jamaica.  Service par excellence!!!"
1051,"Terrible customer experience. Just got back from Dallas, the tv screen did not work and the charger port was broken so I could not charge my phone. Their app is also glitchy and locked me out of check in for my vacation. So now I need to come in several hours earlier to check in at the desk and I am not garanteed to sit with my wife... customer rep did not care about my situation, it is clear AA could care less about their customer experience.I exclusively use AA for business and vacationing but will not going forward."
1052,THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER........
1053,"I reached to Orlando airport 3 hours before check in time. So I had a connecting flight from Orlando (departing at 3:38pm)to Miami (departing at 5:55 pm)then to Trinidad (-0:36 arrival) The flight #AA1362 from Orlando left an hour late so I missed my flight #AA2713 from Miami to Trinidad. I got horrible service, there‚Äôs clearly no communication to flights when it‚Äôs connecting . I asked the gate staff to call the attendants to let them know the flight was late they said I‚Äôll miss the flight. I had to run from E block to D block. Almost passed out  cuz I didn‚Äôt eat since 10 am. The earliest flight I got was to Guyana  departing at 7pm arriving at 12:07am then had a 5 hour wait at Guyana to reach Trinidad.  So I had to wait till 5:35am to leave on a flight from Guyana to Trinidad On top of that when I was rebooking at Miami I asked the counter clerk if my luggage will be on the flight to Guyana she said yes. Upon arriving in Guyana my luggage was not there. I tracked it and they never put it on the flight. Something needs to be done. It was not my fault I missed the flight but the Airlines‚Äôs fault.  Where is the customer service?  Where is the justice? When we are late for flights and miss it we as travelers have to pay for a rebook. But when Airlines make us miss a flight what is the penalty? I want my luggage. I want back my money I want justice."
1054,"American Airlines: Sei vorsichtig oder easy going? Meine Frau und ich: Du Steigst in ein Flugzeug von American Airlines. Zwei Startversuche. Kein Abheben. 4-5 Stunden warten. Alle Triebwerke laufen gut. Starke Gebr√§uche von der Mechanik. Hydraulik? Das Flugzeug wird repariert nach langem Warten. Wir rollen wieder zum Take off. Abbruch! Gleiche Probleme! Alle sollten aussteigen mit Zug fahren oder allem anderen, oder einfach warten und hoffen was kommt. Der Kapit√§n ist ratlos. Mechaniker schaffen es nicht den Schaden zu beseitigen. Nach ca. 5 Stunden Weiterflug durch ein Ersatzflugzeug. Das ist ja alles nicht so schlimm (es war die Kurzfassung). Aber! American Airlines m√∂chte keine R√ºckerstattung (Geld) machen, da der Schaden wohl von einem bird strike kam. Was hat der bird strike eines vorherigen Flugs mit uns zu tun der ja wohl schon erkannt worden ist bevor wir landeten....? H√§tte man sonst problemlos landen k√∂nnen beim vorherigen Flug? H√§tte man nicht direkt ein Ersatzflugzeug besorgen k√∂nnen? Ersatzflugzeug war ja d,a aber nach vielen Stunden! Es sind viele Fragen die sich bei American Airlines auftun. Die Sicherheit geht vor. Aber kann man den Weg von American Airlines akzeptieren? American Airlines lehnt jede R√ºckerstattung ab. Ist das kundenfreundlich? M√∂chte man mit so einer Airline noch einmal fliegen, oder schaut man nach einer anderen Airline?American Airlines: Be careful or easy going? My wife and myself.  You get on an American Airlines plane. Two start attempts. No take off. Wait 4-5 hours. All engines are running well. Strong customs of mechanics. Hydraulics? The aircraft is repaired after a long wait. We roll again to take off. Cancel! Same problems! Everyone should get off by train or anything else, or just wait and hope for what's coming. The captain is at a loss. Mechanics do not manage to get rid of the damage. After about 5 hours onward flight through a replacement aircraft. That's not all that bad (it was the short version). But! American Airlines does not want to refund (money), as the damage probably came from a bird strike. What has the bird strike of a previous flight to do with us, which has been recognized before we landed ....? Otherwise, could one have landed easily during the previous flight? Could not you directly get a replacement plane? Replacement plane was yes, but after many hours! There are many questions that arise on American Airlines. The safety comes first. But can one accept the way of American Airlines? American Airlines disclaims any refund. Is that customer friendly? Would you like to fly with such an airline again, or do you look for another airline?AA Ref#1-28054584322"
1055,"Sub par service and price. Would have expected a bit more in the ""extras"" department but everything was at a price."
1056,Only use if there is an emergency. 6 HR flight turned into 12hr flight I'll will continue to review...hopeing it will be a while ^.^...note employees really need to check them self's.
1057,"i travel alot through american airline , this week i missed my flight and i called customer service for  reschedule my flight but sorry to say some lady picked up the phone she was really rude and unprofessional was not in a mood to assist , when i asked her name she hangup on me , After this incident for sure american airline lost one of their customer."
1058,"The service on the plane is good, but when you call to the spanish customer service is the worst, it seems they don‚Äôt have any training at all, they are so rude and speak to you with such an actitud, the last time the woman wasn‚Äôt even sure that was me, she was looking at the wrong account, and told me I bought my ticket through American Express ??"
1059,Had an issue with Damaged Luggage. The online customer service department were exceptionally helpful and solved the issue successfully.  They followed up and always respond in good time. Im very impressed and will surely being American again. They clearly value their customers experience.
1060,"I recently travelled on 2 airlines. American Airlines had surly staff on old planes with awful food and entertainment that failed to function. One member of staff drove a heavy metal food trolley into my leg. Her response? Surprisingly, she glared at me, told me off for the impact of her trolley on my leg, and did not even think to ask about my injury or offer treatment. Any other airline staff would have apologised, and checked and treated my injury. Contrast that with EMIRATES who provide economy seating of premium quality with caring, attentive, helpful staff with excellent customer service skills. EMIRATES movies include recent releases on a big screen that works well and their food is of good hotel standard with excellent quality, quantity and choice. American Airlines: you need to change everything: your old planes, your aggressive staff, your non-functioning entertainment system and your awful meals. Please book an Emirates flight and you will see how very very far indeed you are from the modern excellent standards of Emirates."
1061,"Purchased a round trip ticket for my daughter stationed in New Jersey  (military) for the holidays. Her command was ordered to report back a day early. AA couldnt care less. I had to pay another $400 to change flight departure. So glad to see that this company supports our active military members in a professional courtesy way. AA, you just lost another customer."
1062,"Awful!! Why does an airline like BA partner with this tripe! Disgusting food, awful service, toxic, unhelpful staff! Never will do a code share transatlantic flight again."
1063,By far the worst major airline in the US.They separated me and my gf and forced us to take different flights back home because they oversold the tickets.
1064,"We have just had bad experience with American Airlines and had to cancel our vacation, soooo sad , the flight was delayed and we missed connecting flight , and instead of helping and find some solution they told us to cancel our vacation.... I was trying to find another person but they did not even talk to us , they were sooooo rude and ignoring , they said they can not put us to another flight because it is overbooked and no compensation , no hotel or free meal , no sorry , will never flight with the company ever again . Stay away from them if you don‚Äôt want to ruin your vacation!!!"
1065,"This is a SATAN airline! I booked their ticket from StudentUniverse from Atlanta to Saigon with 2 stops in Dallas and Japan. The day of depart when I come to the airport to check in at the counter they told me ""You will check in again in Japan and must take a bus from Narita airport to Haneda airport by yourself"" . They mean when I get in Japan I need to take my baggage back and carry it to the bus from Narita airport to Haneda airport by the bus and all things I need to do by myself in a strange country where I don't speak their language! And how to carry 2 pieces of baggage almost 100 pounds with that far? That the way American Airline treats their customer. I can not understand how they can make a travel terrible like that. How the service is so terribly bad. It's suckly. And their employees at the airport are so rude and impolite.I cancelled the flights and lost $1,200 . Thanks to your trash service AA.I write this review just want to let people know about the terrible bad service of American Airline and AVOID this SATAN Airline. Doesn't get any worse than this. Stay away!My lesson to tell everybody don't go with American Airline to keep yourself safe!I will not ever book any ticket from American Airline anymore in my life until the day I die!SATAN! The airline from Hell."
1066,"Do not EVER fly with this Airline! I paid over $1700 round trip for a flight and checked a bag with the airline in confidence. When I checked my bag in to the airline my bag was locked and only I had the combination to the lock. When we arrive at our destination overseas, the lock is no longer on my bag. Very suspicious so I open the bag and check contents to find that not only was the lock CUT off of my bag illegally, I had a $150 electric razor stolen, a $350 watch, and $500 in cash for spending money stolen along with smaller items. How does this even happen? Who are you putting into a position to steal from me? Why is the airline hiring criminals to handle my luggage which I paid for in confidence that it would be taken care of? I am in another country so I cannot immediately contact anyone via telephone so I fill out a complaint online. To my surprise I actually got a response but unfortunately the response asked me to provide a laundry list of impossible tasks. Receipts for all items stolen, copy of this copy of that, etc. Look I get it, these things happen it's not the end of the world and I will provide what I can that they ask but I know it's not going to be enough. All I was asking for was it to be taken care of properly by the Airline. Instead I get the response of them basically denying responsibility, and if I cannot give the information requested I am still out my $1700 for the ticket and over $1000 of personal affects that were stolen. How can a company call themselves honest and good when they refuse to take responsibility for their illegal actions? I will NEVER fly with them again, NEVER recommend them to any other person, and ALWAYS write a horrible review every opportunity I get until they are able to right their wrong. Again, I do not expect the airline to do anything about this at all because it is already apparent they do not care right off the bat by putting a criminal in place to cut locks off bags and go through their personal affects and take what they please. Good luck to ANYONE trying to fly with American because even if you think your bag is safe and locked, they wont hesitate to cut it right off and steal from you. Thanks for the WORST flight experience I have ever had American Airlines. I wont ever expect anything more from you. If it turns out they DO know how to accept responsibility for hiring criminals then I would consider changing my review/opinion but again, based off how they have handled the matter this far I have ZERO hope of that happening. BE VERY VERY CAFEFUL WHEN USING THIS AIRLINE!!"
1067,"Horrible experience with American Airlines.  I would prefer to give them a no star rating. Due to a weather advisory, I needed to change my tickets to the same flights a week later.  I was told it was 1 day outside of their advisory window and I would need to forfeit my ticket and buy a new ticket.  Unacceptable!"
1068,"Excellent experience! Service was wonderful. I have never flown alone, so as you can imagine I was a little intimidated and stressed! Jeff Jacobs of the Philadelphia Airport was SO kind and helpful to me! Checked me in, had my bag ready to go, within less than 5 mins. Made the process very easy for me. Writing this review while in the Airport still because friendly, helpful, hard working people deserve to be recognized of their genuine kindness!"
1069,"Left my laptop in the seat pocket of ORD to BOS flight. Not smart, I know!AA has a company ‚Äòchargerback.com‚Äô help them get back whatever you leave in their planes. Utterly pointless computer steered non-service. You‚Äôll receive the same txt msg for a week or two indicating that they haven‚Äôt been able to locate your item but will keep looking. After 3 such messages you‚Äôll start to realize that it is hard for a website to actually find anything. The folks who work for AA assured me that I had done everything I could by filling out the online form at chargerback.com.... and that there was nothing they could do themselves....  honestly, it would be so much better if they simply told you ‚Äúyou lost it on out planes, tough luck. You won‚Äôt find it back cause we refuse to look for it!‚Äù I have lost items on various airlines in my over 25 years of flying and always found them with great help from employees of the respective airlines. It is sad to see American Airlines outsourcing such services, that are such opportunities to obtain customer loyalty by simply acknowledging that they care and will do there best to help you."
1070,"My brother has been stuck in the Witchita airport for 2 days! His original flight was cancelled and he was given wrong information for a new flight. Called and we're told he was on an early morning flight but once trying to board he was not allowed due to an incorrect boarding pass (airports fault.) We call to try and resolve the issue and are told there is absolutely nothing they can do and it's his fault and a basic economy has zero value and we could purchase a full fare $450 last minute ticket. SANDRA PARKS WAS CALLOUS AND RUDE. SHE WAS COMPLETELY UNHELPFUL AND UNAPOLOGETIC. REFUSED TO LET ME SPEAK WITH HER SUPERVISOR BECAUSE ""HER SUPERVISOR DOESN'T TAKE PHONE CALLS"" THIS IS A LIE ALL SUPERVISORS TAKE CALLS. SANDRA PARKS SHOULD BE FIRED. PERIOD"
1071,"Had an amazing trip to new orleans booked for mardis Gras, my mother was unable to attend due to personal matters, i had paid for the flights in full they said a name change for my partner would be $600 as he was out of the country at the time... when we went to name change they re neg‚Äôd and said my mothers ticket would have to he cancelled to resecure his seat in her place and charged an extra $1400 for the same flight. American airlines are criminal extortionists that cost me $2000 in cancellations as we could not justify a $2600 flight which i had already secured at $1200 if i could give them zero stars i would they give Americans a bad name and wouldnt know customer service if it bit them in the backside. I speak on behalf of Australians youve ripped off.. ‚Äúinsert colourful language‚Äù They were happy to loose a customer and take my money with nothing in return. Oh they also saw it fit to completely change my flights around prior to asking permission first..."
1072,So question. Is she right when she told us ‚Äú damn people‚Äù? We honestly does not know that we can only bring 2 bags in the aircraft. My parents and I have 8 bags in total. After the wheel chair helper told us that we can only bring 2 bags for each person; therefore I brought 2 bags for check in. And the black lady(short and braced hair)  came help us with a bad attitude and said we are ‚Äú damn people‚Äù . I dont know why she got mad. I only brought 2 bags for check-in . I mean Im very frustrated with That lady staff.
1073,"American Airlines is the MOST INEFFICIENT and DISRESPECTFUL airline out there. They are ALWAYS late, and today they got to my limit by canceling my first flight at 3pm for NO REASON AT ALL, they also expected me to get on a different flight to Boston v√≠a FLORIDA. After I discussed for 20 minutes with a very disrespectful customer service assistant she proceeded to give me a ticket to a flight straight to Boston 3 hours later (keep in mind she said several times it wasn‚Äôt possible to fly straight to Boston today, disregarding the fact that I paid 700$ in order to fly STARIGHT WITH NO STOPS). The 6pm flight got cancelled after many hours of delay and now they won‚Äôt give me my carry on bag which they made me check back, and lithe cherry on top is that they expect me to leave tomorrow to philly and on Tuesday to Boston. Of course I am expected to pay for the hotel because that is the American Airlines way! Do yourself a favor and stay away from this so called airline."
1074,Do not ship a live animals with them .  My puppy was to be in Jacksonville at 3:28 pm and didn't get to me until 7:34pm. At least she was still alive but had been at airports and in the air since 6am. Please don't send puppies though Cargo. Terrible experience and would never do it again I feel so bad for the poor puppy.
1075,"Old aircraft, broken seat hurting my neck and my back!!! They said they could do nothing about it!!! Terrible service!!!"
1076,"My wife and I had a 2 hour layover at the same gate. Due to American Airlines unprofessional employees that would rather stand around and talk about their weekend we missed our flight. Almost seems impossible correct? Here is how it happened:1.	1.5 hours before the flight I go to the desk and ask if they could move our seats so my wife and I could sit together. Your representative looked at my tickets and the computer and told me to go sit while she works on it. She would call me. 2.	About the time of boarding I went to the same counter when I heard my name called. 3.	I spoke with an agent. She asked me ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù (Just like that). I explained to her I heard my name called and you were looking and changing our seats. The agent said ‚ÄúYou did not talk to me‚Äù. I replied okay can you find out what is going on? (The Agent was obviously upset and made it clear to me she was upset because I took her out of a personal conversation with 4 other employees all doing nothing but talking about their weekend.) She found my tickets lying on the counter and told me to go sit down again and she would work on it. I told her I would rather wait as my name was called. She offensively insisted that I take a seat while ‚ÄúShe works on it‚Äù. Important note here, it has been a long time since I was treated like a child and was told to take a seat. 4.	The Agent went back to her conversation and by the time she looked up our information the plane had closed the gate.5.	The Agent came over in a panic and rushed us to the next gate attendant, she was at ‚ÄúB‚Äù and the plane was leaving at ‚ÄúD‚Äù the next booth over. She handed us our same tickets and obscenely ran us up to gate ‚ÄúD‚Äù but it was too late. 6.	I told the Agent at that time that I just had explained to her they were calling our names. She walked away very rudely saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault‚Äù. I said then whose fault is it? Yes it is your fault. I said this is 100% your fault. She just started to walk away without even an apology. I would not have this girl work for one of my companies if she was the last person alive to take the job. We ended up flying over our final destination of Oregon for another hour to Seattle. Then we had to run across the huge Seattle airport to make our connection back to Oregon."
1077,"I would just like to inform you of a few unfortunate events that happened on my plane ride home, with your company, from LA today. When I first got on the plane I said hello to the flight attendant who was standing in front of the door and she directed me to go down the second aisle to get to my seat. Before turning down the aisle I looked at my ticket to double check my number and did not notice the two flight attendants standing in the back left corner. As I passed by them I heard a woman's voice say very loudly ""I just love being ignored. What is she too pretty to say hello?"" I then heard another voice respond loudly ""yeah I guess she is too pretty to say hello"" I turned around to see who see who could have said something so rude, embarrassing and unprofessional and realized it was one of your flight attendants, in her mid to late 40's, with dark hair that was tied up and pink lipstick, smirking at me. I did not see who the other flight attendant was because I quickly turned around completely embarrassed and appalled by her behaviour. Some of the people in line turned around to look at me as well as some of the clients already sitting down that overheard. Completely embarrassed I continued to my seat and when I got there I noticed someone had put their luggage in my overhead bin. Not knowing whose it was, since I was travelling with someone who had not yet reached their seat, I removed the luggage and put it in the overhead bin across from me. I paid full price for my tickets and like on any other airline I have traveled with the overhead storage belongs to the people sitting in those seats. A flight attendant came along and started yelling asking whose luggage it was because it wasnt put properly in the overhead bin. The flight attendant had short hair worn loose, late 40's, possibly early 50's, and skinny. No one in our section answered, when I informed her that I had moved it because it was in the overhead bin that belonged to me and the other passenger and we both had very expensive items in our luggage and did not want it in someone else's overhead bin for that reason. The flight attendant then started yelling at me, in front of everyone, that the bins were first come first serve and she did not care what I had in my luggage and that the luggage would go wherever there was room. When I quietly explained that I had flown with american airlines before, as well as air France, air canada, United, sunwing, etc and i had seen the other flight attendants move luggage because it belonged to someone in another section, she once again got upset and raised her voice demanding that I move the luggage back to where it was, she did not care what anyone else did since I was on her flight and would follow her rules. I decided not to pursue this any farther since she was becoming visibly upset, raising her voice and other passengers were staring at me. I sat down and could hear her telling the other flight attendants what had happened and claiming I was acting entitled and ""who does she think she is"". During the entire flight the crew that would pass by me would stare, when they offered me beverages or snacks they were cold and rude; my television stopped working halfway through the flight and I did not want to say anything for fear of upsetting the crew even more. The flight was freezing as well, I had a blanket and was still shivering. When I left the flight I kept my head down because of all the events that took place and as I was leaving the same flight attendant, that made her comment to me when I entered the flight, said very loudly as I passed her ""Goodbye to you too"".I have never experience something like this in all the years that I have been flying. This was completely unprofessional, rude and extremely embarrassing for me. The girl that was flying with me couldn't believe how your flight attendants behaved and how they continued to act throughout the entire flight. I was on the 7:20 flight from Los Angeles to Philedelphia, Flight number AA 1799"
1078,"AMERICAN AIRLINES - the most arrogant airline in the world.Just been on a family holiday to Orlando.. we flew out there with British airways and the whole experience with them was 100% @ Heathrow Terminal 5. Everything from check in to getting on the plane.Our return flights from Orlando were with Americans Airlines.. ( I have flown with them before to Miami and vouched I would never fly with them again, the reason why I had to use them again as my father booked the flights for the whole family)Now checking in at Orlando International Airport.. straight away the check in lady was rude to my father and very arrogant. She didn‚Äôt want to help and kept huffing and puffing. Not sure if it was due to a family of 12 needing to be checked in or was it that we were from an Indian decent? I do honestly think she was Racist as I heard how she greeted white passengers all happy and merry. Two of our bags were over weight by 2kg.. the other 10 bags were well under weight.. she made a big fuss about those two bags and made us take out 4kg to other bags.. other airlines have never complained about 2kg over.. She saw her chance to make it very difficult for us and probably had enjoyment watching us open our suitcases. Whilst we went away to sort the bags out she had mysteriously dissapapered and returned to the desk 5 mins after we was seen by someone else..AMERICAN AIRLINES your ground staff is terrible. The only saving grace with this airline is the flight crew they are amazing.I will never fly American again and would rather pay double to fly with another airline.. PLEASE DO NOT BOOK VIA THIS ARROGANT TYPICAL AMERICAN AIRLINE."
1079,I would give this airline 5 negative stars. I am flying 1st class.  They have no monitors / TV and NO Power connectors what so ever. Flight attendance making excuses. This is a A321 aircraft.  AA choose to have this aircraft equipped as is.  You are told to use your own device!!!   BUT THERE IS NO POWER SOURCE TO POWER YOUR OWN DEVICE!!!!!!!! Totally resicioulous!!!!  4 hours flight from SFO to DFW. Flight 1671Totally
1080,The other day I flew from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in order to view several houses which I am interested in purchasing.  My morning flight was delayed which caused me to miss out on a listing because I was late due to the delay in the flight. After a full day of househunting I had a flight from Las Vegas back to Los Angeles.  That flight was delayed by two hours.  I can tell you that the delay was not weather related in sunny Las Vegas and Los Angeles.  To add insult to injury the pilot announced that due to turbulence they had suspended the drink service.  So after a two hour delay I couldn‚Äôt even get a bottle of water. Let me make clear that the flight was smooth and we had no turbulence. I overheard the flight attendants saying that the plane was not restocked and they didn‚Äôt have enough water for everybody.  I arrived in Los Angeles at midnight and anyone who takes Uber knows that the rates are cheaper on Saturday at 10 then they are at midnight.  It‚Äôs not necessarily a big amount but it is the principle that American Airlines couldn‚Äôt be on time and yet I‚Äôm not expecting a check from them.  In this case time really is money.
1081,NEW AA  POLICY.....When they cancel or delay a flight .... the new AA corporate policy is to their ticket counter..... don't help the flyer with other airlines.  This is so very true.  Corporate greed will bite them.  Check it out.  I worked with them for 6 years and could not  take their  abuse of the flying public.  Check it out.  They use sub par regional airlines like ENVOY... they own them..  watch out for American Airlines..... I could write a book on these characters.
1082,"If I could rate American Airlines less than a one I would. It makes me so sad that because I purchased the ""cheapest ticket"", which the customer service rep repeated at least a half a dozen times, that I automatically agreed to no refund or changes. They are basically stealing my money. I am out 465.23 cents, which may seem cheap to a lot of people, but is a lot of money to me.On top of that, they want to emphasize that it is because I am stupid that this happened. I am sick."
1083,Worst time maintanance. Worst crew maintanance. Everything is worst. Worst to the core
1084,"Horrible customer service representatives they are rude. After explaining an important circumstance to a Mr. Ed Henderson who and I quote was ‚Äúthe only reservations supervisor in this Texas location‚Äù, he tried nothing to help except say these inconsiderate words ‚Äújust pay the $60 your other ticket has no value‚Äù. How can a company this large hire such disgusting people who lack empathy for those of us with circumstances that have no alternative options. I have flown AA many times and this is the first time I have actually experienced the degrading tone of these respresentatives that many other previous customers speak about. I will not fly with this company nor will I recommend such an inconsiderate airline service to others. I just hope that one day Mr. Ed Henderson does not have a circumstance in which he is faced with such a person as himself."
1085,"Terrible service, delays on my last 2 flights. Service issues.American airlines employees are lost in the situation. Get some help.Update : hour and an half later.Finally on the plane,  waiting for more than an hour,  on the tarmac,  ready to leave. Them the pilot says his time is up,  he cannot fly anymore tonight.  What a joke. American airlines is terrible,  done fly them, look for other carriers. Their service sucks big time.Dont fly american."
1086,"You guys suck , delayed twice in two days. Employees that cannot speak English."
1087,"Rental car co shuttle made us late for our return trip. We were 40 min before flight but cutoff was 45. They wouldn't let us checkin bc we had a bag. ""It can't fly without you"". Of course, on our trip to HI, they lost our bag and it flew alone and we had no luggage for our first night. Nasty counter agent named Shannon kept saying ""I'm sorry YOU were late"". They told us we had to fly 24 hours later even tho there was a flight 4 hours later. Unlike Delta, they had to get permission to allow us to fly 4 hours later on a flight that was NOT full. They made us pay $200 each in a change fee AND a fare cost difference. We paid $600 more to leave that night. Counter agents lied on our complaint form of when we tried to check in. AA never contacted us on complaint until I msg them one week later. They just cited their ""rules"". As I stated, Delta would accommodate with no fee IF possible on this. I will Never use AA again. If you like being pushed for credit cards on flights with the bait and switch of free flights (not true), use them but I will never"
1088,"Really bad organization and customer service!!! I had to share my bad experience with British Airways operated by American Airlines . On Monday 27th my daughter and I supposed to fly in Chicago from Atlanta at 7:15am (flight # 1951) and from Chicago having our next flight to London at 9:15 am (flight #1541). I supposed to meet my sister at Heathrow Airport in London so we booked a hotel in London airport for the night of 27th until next morning Tuesday 28th because we had tickets to go in Paris, France. So we checked in just fine in Atlanta we went through security line‚Ä¶ no problem we got at the gate in time, we got our seats, boarding passes and then we were waiting to go in a plane to Chicago. Right when they scan our tickets, they told us to get on the side to fix the boarding passes because the ‚Äúsequence #‚Äôs are wrong!!! And was British Airways mistake ( so either way was not our problem).  Instead of taking the time to fix our problem (the lady in a front her name was Michelle) she and her co-worker they were trying to fix other people problems and didn‚Äôt let us go in a plane even that we told them our next bookings and connections we have. They called the manger in charge for that day and she didn‚Äôt care to figure out what is going on. She left because she had a emergency problem not ‚Äúminor problem‚Äù like ours so we were left I  Atlanta airport. Michelle finally put us on 10:00 pm direct flight from Atlanta(the only one available) So we had to spend all day in airport and miss our hotel night and almost the flight to Paris. We had a check in luggage that travel to Chicago and  couldn‚Äôt be located so we had to file a claim  when we got in Paris. We received the luggage on Thursday 30th so 2 days before we were leaving Paris. This really was upsetting us‚Ä¶ we had to spend money to get some clothes to wear and personal items, so really extra unexpected expenses."
1089,"My flight from LGA to DTW was an absolute wreck. First, the airport's maintenance system went down so we had to wait 10 minutes for someone to deliver the log book. Then, there was another delay in taxiing to the runway. Then, when we arrived, we were waited to be reassigned to a different gate. When we got to the gate, the operator broke the jet bridge so we were stuck on the plane for another 15 minutes while someone ""fixed"" it. The result was me almost missing my connection. Complete disaster"
1090,"AMERICAN AIRLINES CUSTOMERS SERVICES SUCKS! Yesterday we were in the vegas airport trying to catch a flight to dallas and the lady helping people print tickets is making faces like the last thing she should be doing is helping anyone! Unfortunately we needed her help. She was very condisending then ended up having the same issue we were having. it would be laughable except hours sitting at the airport were on the line! We then found out the plane was delayed and there was a good chance we wouldn't make our connecting AA flight to Peru. So then we go to customer service to talk with another lady who hates her job. There is another flight that is leaving before our flight since we got there very early but she will not try to get us on that flight. Probably because it will take effort on her part. She does assure us though that our bags will be checked all the way to Peru (more on that later). Well the flight was delayed even more and we ended up missing our connecting flight. So instead of catching our flight to Peru at 7 pm it was 2 am. So thanks american for turning a 12 hour trip into a 24 hour trip. And the cherry on top my bags never left Dallas. We're filling out forms now to try to get them. American used to be a good airline. Now you might as well get the cheapest flight. It will be better service anyway. Im so disappointed,  I will never fly American again!"
1091,"I must say, if I can avoid flying with AA in the future I would definitely choose that. Our first flight was delayed because of maintenance issues (which is not necessarily their fault but still) so we missed the connecting flight and all they gave us was a aitport hotel room and $24 food voucher for 2 people that can only be used all at once, while we had to pay ourselves for other overpriced meals.However, the reason why I would try to avoid AA is because of the second flight (Chicago-London). The rows were very close together, they were not as tall as with other airlines. Even with the headrest all the way up it was still only slightly above my shoulders. The service was terrible. Two flight attendants sat in the seats behind us. They were not organized or thorough serving food or taking trash. When they served pretzels only one aisle got served in our section because of confusion. I had to tell an attendant that the other aisle hadn't been served. The food was really poor quality and not presented well. The couple in front of us didn't move their seats up during landing so I again had to tell an attendant to help the couple.The one good thing was the movie selection, but even the screens weren't adjustable so I, because of my height, could see it straight on even when putting my seat back. Never again I hope."
1092,I cant be more disgusted and disappointed with American airlines and I will never fly this airline again. Don't waste your time or money if you want to actually GET somewhere!!!! Gross
1093,Customer service is deplorable. Spent an hour on the phone only to be hung up on (accident) but then had to wait another 20 mins to start all over again.
1094,"In America, we have a saying that goes, ""like tits on a bull."" And, that describes American Airlines customer service this week. I had a pretty simple issue because I needed to cancel my reservation due to an illness. I also had refund protection on the flights...so totally in the clear, yeah? But you'd be wrong. Because no one I dealt with could answer the most basic questions about how I should proceed to ensure I got the proper refund on my tickets or whether or not I needed to file a claim or how the combination of refund and change would be handled. I'd assume this isn't an uncommon thing, but I'd be off...I guess. Anyway, I came out of the whole experience more frustrated and less knowledgeable than I started. Wow!"
1095,This company's customer service has a really bad attitude and does not want to solve the problem.
1096,"So, here is why AA is a horrible airline that will never receive another penny from me! We flew my mother in law from Honduras to Virginia, with a connection in MIA. We did everything needed to request her wheel chair service in advance as well as provide an emergency contact number. She checks in, gets wheel chair service to her aircraft. She departs and arrives in Miami for her 2 hour and 34 minute layover. They take her off the plane and to her next gate. Here's where you start to completely fail. There is a gate change and nobody does anything to get the handicap person to her new gate. No, instead, you realize this flight is overbooked and this is an easy ""bump"" to make room. I'll get to the proof of that statement shortly. She realizes after much time she's not leaving MIA on her scheduled flight. Traveling from another country, she has no cell phone to notify anyone. She became upset and crying. Did anyone step in yet? Not American Airlines! Luckily, a passenger say her upset and offered her cell phone for her to make a call. When she got us on the phone, we immediately started calling to find out what happened. The agent on the phone tells us she missed her connecting flight and was rescheduled for the next morning. When asked how or why, we were told she was at a call center and could only ready what was on the screen? Really, that's your customer service? Ok, move on as we now have an issue at hand. We call the courteous traveler back while she is still nearby so we can talk again and try to calm down my mother in law. Starting to ponder if we should start a 16 hour drive, we call another number to American Airlines, I believe at the MIA airport. This person tells us not to worry, they will get her into a hotel as well as transportation to and from. Ok, so now move on to finding out if the bags would arrive on the original flight. This is where the proof comes in that she was purposely bumped to another flight. American could not tell us if the bags were on the original flight or not. We go to the airport and check baggage claim for the original flight. Bags arrive? NO, which tells us they were scheduled for the next day as well. This shows American Airlines had no intention to put her on her scheduled flight because the bags were not transferred to that plane. So, now, where did they take her and is she ok? After all, she is handicap and not able to get around. She came from a foreign country, with no American cash in hand to buy anything. Finally, we track down what hotel they were going to take her to and assured everything would be fine. Then, finally at 3:30am, we are able to speak to my mother in law again. They had literally just put her in a hotel .... AND WITH 3 TOTAL STRANGERS!! Are you kidding me?? Then, have the audacity to tell her she is being picked up at 4:30am in time for her new flight. She is put in this hotel with her carry on, 2 fifty pound checked bags, and her purse. When her shuttle arrives an hour later to take her back to the airport, she is offered no assistance with bags. Now, a handicap person who had wheelchair access requested must now carry 2 fifty pound suitcases, a carry on, and her purse. Again, luck struck as another passenger sees the struggle and starts to help. And lucky for that passenger because the new flight had a gate change as well. Which, now we know, American does nothing to assist with and just let you miss your flight. If anyone could possibly rationalize this into any form of being acceptable, I'd love to hear it! Again, American Airlines will never see another penny from us. I hope dearly they get what they deserve and go bankrupt!! You people are pathetic to say the least."
1097,"All my experience with American Airlines has been terrible!!!!!!! And tiday( August 11, 2018) tops them alll. I booked my flight to travel from NY to Orlando with my children for school(they should start school on August 13,2018)  no one called or emailed to say it was canceled. On top of it being canceled they lost my luggage and had me waiting for over 3 hours saying my bag is there but no one can locate it. Everyone was so nasty, and disrespectful, including the managers and supervisors. I would never travel on this airline ever again in life. Until now I can‚Äôt get my bag or any word about it! I asked where to go to claim for my bag and everyone behave as if I was speaking Chinese to a bunch of people who had no idea what I was saying. On top of that they were issuing blankets because the gate area was so cold and my son went for a blanket and the guy did not give my 6 year old a blanket on top of being canceled without notifications. Not even a bottle of water was offered. I would never ever travel on this airline ever again !"
1098,"If I could give you cero stars I would. Every single time I fly there is a delay of a few hours and/or the air craft has technical issues. I always say to my self give them another chance, but nope this girl is never flying AA again. At this very moment my sister whom is ill and has to be at BWI for medical treatments has missed her appointment due to a four hour delay by AA coming from MIA airport. Oh and there is nothing they can sue about it, not even accommodate for a different flight. Complete rubbish that‚Äôs what it is."
1099,The aircrafts are way too old and outdated ...that is a no no .... I miss they AWESOME American Airlines
1100,good experience. well organized.
1101,"This past April I booked a trip for my 2 children and I.  There was a problem with the flight and American rebooked us new flights without my consent.  My minor children were on a different flight than I.  I called immediately to try to rectify the situation.   The representative was not very helpful.   She wanted us to do a red eye, drive 2 hours for a different flight and then 2 hours from a different airline to our original destination, or fly to a city for overnight and get up early to fly  to a city 2 hours from our destination.   Considering my children needing sleep and this representative insisting these were the only options I felt trapped.  She assured me if I kept all my receipts the airline would reimburse me.   THAT WAS A TOTAL LIE.  I had multiple emails and multiple phone conversations after my trip with different representatives.  They all say the same thing like they're reading off a script.   They don't care about their customers.   In the end they offered me money towards flying with them again, but I will NEVER.  They also offered me a third of what I paid on my hotel and refused to pay any towards my rental car fee, which was 110.00 more because of their change!! They constantly said they do not give refunds for things out of their control.  Well maybe they should make sure their representatives aren't telling people they'll get their money back!!!!!!!!! It just set them up for a very unhappy customer.   Who will NEVER fly with them everrrrrr!"
1102,"My flight was scheduled to leave Miami to Chicago 4:00pm, it was changed to 415 after everyone boarded the plane the pilot annouces that a peice needed to be changed on the plane and that wud take only 30 mins well here it is 553pm and we are still sitting here, I think that's un exceptable, inconsiderate, I just can't believe they have us just sitting here it's not Kool at all, I wish can leave zero stars."
1103,"Myself and my wife were flying American with the same luggage that weighed 60 pounds. On our way to Phoenix , we checked this bag in with no problem and with little attitude. On our return trip, as soon as we came up to American Airlines to check in we were greated with attidude! Please note that we are both in the military and for other airlines, if the bag exceeds 50 pounds it is still fine to fly with no extra fees. We were told we would have to pay $100 because we had went over the limit when we had checked the exact same bag in prior and didn‚Äôt have to pay a dime. The woman checking us in stated ‚Äúyou got a freebie on your way in, I don‚Äôt understand why you are complaining‚Äù from that point out we only received attitude and total disrespect from both other employees and the manager. We will never be flying american again nor will we be recommending it to anyone else, save yourself the headache."
1104,"The flight from LHR to MSP was delayed by 14Hrs by American AirlinesTan Preet Singh is on WheelChairRichie Puri is an Old lady* Both of them were stranded at the LHR airport for several hours without any assurance of a hotel accomodation or a lounge.* No food or drink for several hours* No one from AA even bothered to check if they were Ok.* Tan Preet Singh is a case of Down Symdrome and was on wheel chair - still no one bothered to get the accomodation booked.* They were given a hotel after 4hrs of wait and were taken to ""Premier Inn"" at T4.* When they arrived at the hotel, they told the passengers that they are full. NO ROOMS* The passengers kept on pleading the hotel staff to arrange room in a diff. hotel maybe as the kid is on wheel chair and they havent had anything to eat since several hours.* They even denied to accept USD as a currency for food to purchase.* The passengers had no choice but to go back to T3 and wait for the 9hrs more for the next flightIs this how the Aviation Industry is working ?? Is this how the Airlines have started to treat the passengers ?Are the passengers really on the mercy of the incompetent airport staff appointed by the airlines ??We want a 200% compensation on this for all the stress this has caused for the passengers in London, family back in India and the family in USA whom they were visiting.I (Chitkaran Singh, son of Richie Puri) had to co ordinate at 3am with Mom (at Heathrow) and aunt (in USA) just to ensure that she was OK and they are not panicking at any stage"
1105,It makes no sense to continuously cancer flying guys and NOT have a backup plan for your passengers. I‚Äôm feeling annoyed.
1106,"Absolutely no respect for customers. We book with them very frequently for business trips several times a month and occasionally they make mistakes in their bookings where the flights end up not being ticketed according to the customer service rep even though when we look up our confirmed flight online it says STATUS: TICKETED. I once had to wait at a ticket counter almost an hour and a half before they corrected my reservation and it was a near miracle that I made my flight at all. When I wrote to customer service about it asking for an explanation, so we could avoid this happening again, the response I got was a rehearsed email apology saying that they were sorry we had a bad experience - almost as if it was our fault! No explanation, no attempt at reconciliation, much less compensation for the unbelievable aggravation and stress their mistake caused. Wish we could avoid them altogether but they offer the most frequent nonstop flights to our regular destinations from our home airport. Since the merger with USAir they have deteriorated and seem to make ZERO effort to please their customers. They know they have close to a monopoly and can afford to screw and displease everyone with no repercussions. It's too bad because individually their employees on the phone and in person are pretty wonderful. They just don't bother to hire enough of them so that things like what happened to us don't happen regularly. Employees are great indivdually but the corporation sucks overall. Sorry but it's the truth."
1107,People behaved unacceptable and the flight attendant was rude. Wont fly with them again
1108,Hideous Airline Recently flew to Ecuador on an overcrowded aircraft with a filthy black mold looking substance above my seat. Consequently I became sick and visited my doctors when I got home and was put on Strong antibiotics to treat a severe bronchial sinus ear nose and throaght infection resulting in green infection advised by doctors likely caused by the flight.
1109,"While I have typically enjoyed flying aA over the years my mistake was putting faith in them while they have not reciprocated. Living in Dallas they often were my carrier of necessity. To the point where I had accumulated over 77,000 miles I was going to use to take my wife on vacations for putting up with my constant flights and airport delays. A few years back I suffered a stroke and due to lack of activity on my account they took back all my points that I had bought with each flight. Now they tell me I can buy them back again. Why would I bother. aA has told me as a stroke patient I don‚Äôt matter. Do the right thing AA! I can not recommend you but I do know Delta didn‚Äôt touch my mileage and I did very little flying from my hospital bed."
1110,"Very Brief Description!The day of my return flight back home, at 11:47am, I received a text from American that my flight to Dallas from SLC at 5:25pm was cancelled and that I would receive an update on re-booking soon.  By 1pm still no text message.  I tried calling customer service and was told the wait time was 1 hour and 45 minutes.  After being on hold for 45 minutes, I just headed to the airport, to speak to someone in person as it was imperative that I return home that day.  I told the counter guy my flight was cancelled and that I never received any notification of a new flight.  He asked if I happened to be heading to Dallas with a connector to Austin Texas.  I said yes.  He said they cancelled the flight due to low number of passengers and booked everyone on an earlier flight that goes to Phoenix then a connector to Austin Texas.  He gave me a boarding pass for the flight to Phoenix.  I asked about my boarding-pass for the flight from Phoenix to Austin and he stated that he wasn't able to get me a seat assignment as at that time it was up to that airport to assign it.  He assured me that the flight wasn't full at all and that when I get to the gate in Phoenix they would get me my boarding-pass no problem at all.  My flight from SLC to Phoenix was delayed an hour and made me miss my flight in Phoenix.  I made it to the gate and the plane was still there but the gate guy said I wasn't on that flight and he wouldn't let me on.  After arguing for 5 minutes, the other gate crew shut the door and he said well its to late now.  I then had to go to another rep who said all he could do is put me up in a room and get me on a flight the next day.  I had to miss a day of work, take vacation time, and not one person at AA showed any empathy.  This was not my fault but the fault of AA and I want compensated fully for all my frustrations and missed work time.  I travel a lot and as of right now will never fly AA again unless you can do something to make it right!"
1111,"ü§¨ü§Ø üò°Once again American Airlines has managed to screw us! Flight delayed so bad out of PNS that we can‚Äôt make our DFW connection üò°ü§Ø ü§¨To dig the knife deeper, all AA flights for the next 2 days from DFW to PNS are sold out. Now I am stuck paying for a rental car I never picked up and a hotel cancellation so last minute that I can‚Äôt cancel or change the dates! American Airlines just cost me $1500- $2k for a trip I can‚Äôt take due to THEIR delays! OMG I miss Southwest Airlines!! Lesson learned.......üôÑü§Øü§¨ü§¨ ü§¨#AmericanAirlines"
1112,"AA is a monopoly and charges monopoly rates. I recently bought a premium economy flight and inquired to upgrade and was quoted to pay $4,000.The ticket already cost around 2k. The airline provides ZERO value add. You can summarize AA with one word: GREEDY."
1113,"American Airlines is LITERALLY THE WORST airline I've ever flown. My 5:00 a.m. flight to Charlotte was delayed a little over an hour, because the AC was broken, after we were told it would take 10-15 min to fix. We then missed our connecting flight from Charlotte to New Orleans and the next one was almost FOUR HOURS later. We had paid extra to have seats next to each other and in preferred seating and when we got off the plane and had to get new boarding passes we were basically told too bad nothing they can do about it. When we arrived to New Orleans EVERYTHING in my bag was damp and all my clothes had to be put in the dryer.... But i had NOTHING in my bag that could've leaked. On the way back, we had a layover in Chicago of an hour until our connecting flight to Newark. 40 minutes before our flight we found out we're delayed an hour. Im sure 500 other things will go wrong before we evenget back to Jersey. First and LAST time i ever fly American Airlines. Literally the worst flying experience of my life, and I once flew Spirit which is basically a clown car so that says a lot. Get it together AA, you suck."
1114,"I took American Airlines from HNL to get to LV and had a stop over in LA. The flight from HNL to LA was okay, but from LA to LV I was next to an overweight person. I am not upset with this person, but I am upset with the flight attendant for not taking notice of my discomfort and taking action. Due to circumstances, the arm rest was not even able to go down so I did not have my whole seat (which is already very tiny) and I was constantly touching a stranger the whole flight. I did a bit of research after-- and apparently if you can't put your armrest down you do have you buy two seats or purchase a bigger seat. This was a very awkward, uncomfortable, and tight five and a half hour flight. It would have been very difficult to get out and I would not know how to approach an attendant about the situation, but she did walk by a couple times and look at me with a weary smile or just avoid eye contact completely...Next, on the way back home to HNL it was just the worst experience ever! I arrived the airport in LV three hours early and our flight got delayed twice. I understand that these things happen but when the plane finally boarded, the attendant told me that I actually missed my plane.So my ticket says gate #5 and I'm going to LA, and I'm at gate #5 that says LA. The attendant gives me a lot of attitude and says I should have noticed it was a different flight number. Apparently our gate got moved and they announced it, and the gate that we were at just happened to be the around a similar time, same airline, and destination. This was just sooooo crazy to me, because I was sitting in front of this gate for five hours. I literally did not go anywhere. Also I hear the announcements they making, calling flyers for the last time before flight take out. They give many warnings. They even call guest by names. So I am here just feeling like... I totally messed up or something ... or I just may be very confused or missed something? BUT THEN-- they same exact thing literally happened to around 8-10 other people. They were waiting for the same flight as mine and just completely confused. The attendant realizes it wasnt't just me. Her and another attendant even say among themselves that they were caught up and didn't do as much announcements for that flight and they were wondering why it was so empty... they then hastily assist us on to this flight.As this flight has been delayed-- they announced that 28 people are catching the same connecting flight to HNL and that since it is cutting it close an agent will meet us at the gate. Wow, sounds very accommodating right?Well LV to LA is a very quick flight. As stated, there are several agents waiting when we get off the plane. I go up to one, and she tells me to wait in line to speak to another agent. While waiting I see her continue to direct people in the same situation to also stand in line with me. When it's my turn, the agent gives points me in a direction, tells me the gate that is already on my ticket, and tells me I have to run because I have SEVEN MINUTES. So... I run. After spending two minutes in line to find a gate number I already had. Couldn't the first agent just point me in the direction? As I'm walking away frustrated, I see the first agent telling more people headed to HNL to stand in line... just very inefficient. Soooo I'm running to my gate. American airlines, gate 50A. I have to go down an escalator, make a u-turn, and go down a long hall, then it's on the right. As I'm running it says like ""gates 1-49"" one way and ""gates 50-something"" another... but then in the long hall it changes to "" gates 1-50"" the way THAT I LEFT and "" gates 51-something"" in the direction I'm walking. THE SIGNS ARE MISLEADING. So I'm freaking out. I actually run back to read the initial sign to make sure I read it correctly, which I did. And I pass the second sign again, which is different. But I go with it.... and I make it to my gate. Which got delayed so I didn't need to run. Just‚Ä¶ a very stressful experience."
1115,"The worst experience I've had.  Two cancelled flights back to back on 5/21/18.  Was a loyal Southwest flyer and when moved near IAH thought to give AA a shot.  The worst mistake ever.  Was late to business meeting two and half hours late, flight  5933 due to cancellation and delays.  Return flight home cancelled as well, flight 5864 (cancelled because could not find captain to fly airplane).  Had to book last minute through Southwest to get home to my son's award ceremony the next day.  We pay top dollar for dirt class service.  If American Airlines ever wants my business again, it has some major changes to make."
1116,"I think American Airlines just lost another customer. Here is why: Back in December 2017, I had a good experience with American Airlines despite many complaints I have received about them. Since I had a good experience, I decided to book another trip back in February 2018 for June 2018 for a 4 day trip. My husband and I are traveling to the same place so naturally I wanted the same seats even if I had to pay extra for them. I chose seats 10E and 10F. I chose these seats because 10F is an exit row seat with no seat in the front so my 6‚Äô1 husband has leg room and feels comfortable while flying. I paid an extra $64.96 for those seats round trip. Fast forward to today, May 11th 2018, I decided to join the American Airlines AAdvantage Program and add my trip. When I went to add my trip, my seating arrangement was different than what I had originally booked. It said 23E and 23F. I called American Airlines to see what happened and they said there was a schedule change with both of my scheduled flights. I asked about the seating arrangement and they said that 10E and 10F were no longer available so they gave us 23E and 23F. Not only are we sitting 13 rows back from what I originally chose, the woman I spoke to could not guarantee the leg room for my husband. She said they changed the schedule back in March, yet I received no email of the change in times or seating arrangement. The lady stated that I was refunded for the extra money I had paid but I was only refunded $41.10 not the entire $64.96. Their reasoning for not giving my the rest of the money was that they are putting my husband and I in seats that cost extra. The whole explanation was ridiculous. Then, the lady told me that she had seats available towards the front but for an extra cost. Now, why would I pay extra for seats when I had the perfect seats from the beginning? If someone did their job correctly, my husband and I should have been given those seats as we had paid for them. I didn‚Äôt even receive a notice. What if I did not check my flight and didn‚Äôt hear about this until the day of my flight? I find this to be unacceptable. My flights get switched, my seating is different, I received no notice of these changes plus I don‚Äôt even receive a full refund for the seats. American Airlines, if you continue doing things like this, your reviews will go from a 2 to a 1. You are lucky people decide to still fly with you because this is not what people want when they fly. I‚Äôd rather pay more for another airline then deal with crap."
1117,"To cut to the chase I was supposed to fly on AA from Ohare to Albuquerque, but failed to make the outward bound trip due to illness. I was intending to fly out the a week later and using the return leg of the Ticket, but without my authorization, The excuse given being that failing to fly the first leg of the meant the both legs of the flight were voided, response: ""Flights must be flown in order or the ticket will have no value"" and sent a link to the terms that had no reference to this situation. AA cancelled the return flight. Business practices are questionable as are the standards of service."
1118,"TODAY TUE MAY 1ST MY FLIGHT WAS CANCELLED WITHOUT A 24 HOURS OR A LEAST 4 HOURS ANTICIPATING NOTICE,THEN, IS NO THE FIRST TIME THIS IS THE 3RD TIME THE SECOND TIME THIS HAPPENED I WAS ABOUT TO BOARD THE AIRPLANE.

1119,"1st ticket, round trip cost 415 dollars. I need to come in a few days early so I just buy another ticket thinking I could keep my return trip. No sir, 530 to take a one way return that I still have booked! I cannot think of any other business that can do this to their customers. It was pretty much extortion, 1,000 miles from home and have to take this flight. AA I will make sure to re write this on every review site, social media, and Tell it to every stranger I talk to."
1120,the staff was friendly and the flight arrived on time. 4 stars because i thought the food could of been better.
1121,"Do not fly with AA. It‚Äôs a rip off, scam and lie, and rude. We fly back to our country Vi·ªát Nam every year with American Airlines. We always bring a lot of gifts . We always checked baggage rules before flight. The first two 50lbs baggages are always free with international flight . If we put extra 20lbs in the baggage , it will be $100, and third additional baggage is $200. But today at the Knoxville (TYS) AA, a lady name Lana Gibson with some kind of accent and tattoo on her right arm told me that i have to pay $500 for only 20 lbs extra , or $400 for the third bags, or I have to take out 19 lbs extra out. No exception. She is super mean ,  and bit**. in the middle of airport , we have to take out 20lbs of our bag. üò°üò°üò°.Even we check with AA ticket customer service , they said the same thing, only $100 for extra 20lbs, $200 for third bag, and their website still said the same things . And the airport , she asked for $500 extra. I never heard about that much charge at all. One of the guy working for them at the kiosk , he said only $100 for 20lbs extra, and this bit*h just jump in and said $500. How come you get ready for your trip if you just pack everything , follow the rules and don‚Äôt know what the heck is going on . From now on, never flight with AA airline , even domestic #AA #AmericanAirline"
1122,"I refuse to use American Airlines ever again after what ordeal I had to go through. I had booked a trip on Expedia to go to Aruba for my honeymoon in September 18'. We were never informed when we booked our trip that Aruba was infected with Zika virus. We are trying to get pregnant and are no longer able to travel to this country. We spoke with Expedia, who at first mentioned that we needed to speak with American Airlines because they were going to charge us $200 per person as a cancellation fee for the flights. I called AA and they told me that everything has to go through Expedia. They have nothing to do with that $200 charge. Long story short, I went through Expedia, they promised me that all I needed to do was send in a doctors note, which I did, and I just received an email today stating that our request was denied. I am tired of being lied to and clearly $400 is worth losing a customer forever for American Airlines. And don't worry, I will be sure to let all of my friends know and ensure no one else books flights with them again."
1123,"2 Flights, with an hour change over in between.  I was going to say average, but on checking in, they ask for a $25 fee (i think or it could be $50) for checking in luggage.  I queried this with the member of staff and she was not helpful at all.  The question I asked is it is a mandatory charge why is is not added in when I purchase the ticket?  The response was ""because we like to charge you when you are checking in?""  Very strange practice.The flights departed and arrived on time, which is very nice to see.  I used them because the times of the flight was convenient with my plans"
1124,"Dreadful experience generally with AA. I am travelling around the world and have visited 32 countries thus far. There are a number of problems with AA. here is a selection:-1. American Airlines together with other US carriers load the back of the plane last ?? Utterly illogical and adds at least 15 mins to boarding times. You should take a leaf out of the low cost airlines of Europe who board logically by inviting the passengers sitting at the back to board first. Your policy means passengers are held up by the previous sector standing in the aisle or loading their cases in the overhead bins.2. Charged for bags on each sector. A hidden extra which alone would cause me to avoid AA whenever possible.3. No WIFI working on any flight thus far4. Bags lost of the SFO- SJO flight5.  Flight delayed from SFO - DFW, Therefore missed our connection to SJO Had to sleep in airport. No help or voucher or refund was offered.6. The check-in kiosks haven't yet been able to assist us at any airport.7.Could not check-in online for any obvious reason and was not informed why by your website?That‚Äôs just a flavour of the problems thus far.  #AA #AmericanAirlines  #Advantage"
1125,"Avoid! Never use them! The most awful service! Dirty airplanes! Delays! No explanations, no customer support! No compensation! They make their customers to feel awful and serve the food by hand and not by the trolley that they are supposed to use! Due to this reason you may get half meal and no one would be bothered to help you. I have raised a complaint and no one helped me. Poor service! Extremely disappointed."
1126,i fly aa alot...the only issue i have is the a320 s they use ..very generic ..On a cross country trip your not sure if youll get one that has entertainment ...plug ins etc..can be boring..but who cares ..i just want to get there...very good service especially on red eye flights...its relaxing and well maintained ...i would prefer if they updated the fleet with newer aircraft ..thats all..great employees ..unlike United..lol..oops shouldnt laugh ..theirs lawsuits against that creepy outfit..lol
1127,"This is the rudest company I've ever encountered. They go out of their way to harass their own customers, then make it impossible to reach higher-ups for resolution. I feel like this is the single worst American airline to fly with. I have spent more money to fly on other airlines in some situations just to avoid giving them a cent. I have never been treated so badly by a company in my life."
1128,"I have a flight booked with my Mum and Sister to the US from the UK and back. There were some flight changes as my Mum and Sister's flights were booked through British Airways.  I called American Airlines and spoke to Candice who was professional, listened to my problem and solved it without me having to repeat my issue or be transferred. Candice not only got our flight schedules aligned on American airlines but also called British Airways their affiliate airline to ensure that the flights were updated on their system.  It was really nice to talk to someone that knows the meaning of customer service and is not reading from a script. All airline customer service associates should model or use the call Candice had as training, as this was the true essence of customer service"
1129,I just had a traumatic experience with my travel agent from vacationstogo and Globus tours.  I was stranded in Ireland when that terrific snow storm shut down the country.  Travel agent didn‚Äôt help and Globus didn‚Äôt help and the only bright light was when I called American while on the Dublin airport and I begged them to help me reschedule my cancelled flight since the American desk was closed at the airport.  Many thanks to Emma (I believe that was her name) who was able to get me a flight out the following morning rather than spend 3 days stranded  at the airport.
1130,I had just recently got into a car accident and spoke with a man named Hale Clayton's in Winston-Salem he was so helpful and I have never received customer service so well in my life ever and I can't think of any better employee that I would love have to have working for me like that because he went above and beyond and they are so lucky to have someone like that working for them!Thank you Hal
1131,"One of the finest airlines transporting customers. Courteous, friendly, efficient personnel assisting all passengers in a most professional way. We would highly recommend American Airlines."
1132,"After attempts to book ANY seat on line, I called American to reserve a window seat for an overnight flight so I could sleep.  They wanted to charge me $80.  I then asked at the airport and was told there were no window seats available.  When I boarded the plane I saw that the flight was only 1/4 to 1/3 full and there were dozens of available window seats.  My email to American was answered with something resembling a form letter.After flying USAir and then American for years, including several international flights, I will not use them again."
1133,"Switched departure DC to Miami to BWIThey booked a flight from DC to Miami December 1, 2018 online and I purchased the ticket. The portal showed DCA as the departure terminal. Surprise! Checking in Last minute AA told me I needed to get to Baltimore! Took a taxi to Baltimore by an illegal DC cab who was in Arlington (big mistake!). He cruised all the way and made me late. Gate agent wouldn‚Äôt let me in even though the flight had not departed. She stood her ground (you don‚Äôt have a ticket they marked you a NO SHOW) until I grappled. AA gave me a standby and I waited until 5:30 pm to get to Miami the time I should have been returning. Needed a wheelchair I never received (disabled AA and recently injured)! Next I was in Miami during a convention so the only available hotel was at the airport. Spent money on Ubers to get around! Lost my return flight the day before! Booked a flight on AA by kindness of an agent at a decent price. Got back to BWI and paid another $125 to get home on Lyft. 10:30 pm! I was fuming because this trip cost me $1000 due to justflybait lying lowdown bait and switch policies! AA won‚Äôt do anything and the say the ticket was worthless! JustLIES won‚Äôt do anything either because they say I saw my ticket. I said online it was booked FROM DCA. I worked for USAir before they merged and they were liars then too! They said I walked across the yard with an unchecked bag breaching security! I DID NOT. Didn‚Äôt even have a bag on my trip to a NYC dentist! All of the employees boarded the same way and through the same doors! Why did they make an example of my African American self? It was because USAir CEO said it was a prequisite to be Gay in order to work for USAir! So all of this was a continuation of an old agenda! Someone owes me my money back Doug Parker! üõ´‚úàÔ∏èüõ©games! Wouldn‚Äôt let me sit down while not working at the gate! Handicapped then and handicapped now!"
1134,I had 60000 miles with American Airlines and were taken away from me. I do not recommend this garbage airline service thieves   Fadi Razouki
1135,it was fine the flight attendants were nice and the seats are pretty comfortable. Would use again
1136,"First time flying with American Airlines on business. Experience so far is terrible. Check-in position came available, so I popped my luggage on the weighscale only to be abruptly told ‚Äòyou haven‚Äôt be called!‚Äô. I apologised took my luggage off and waited only to be ‚Äòtold‚Äô she was dealing with ticket sales as well - no signage at desk telling me or any other customer that - would have helped.Little customer service things like that ruin a business. American Airlines need to re-train certain staff members on the basics of good customer service #GreatShame"
1137,"There were too many instances of rude service to ignore. I‚Äôll describe just three of the many instances here. While I was waiting to board the plane, an attendant let me know I‚Äôd have to check my carry-on luggage. No problem, I‚Äôm a reasonable person and understand overhead bins fill up. The attendant directed me to a woman at the counter to add a tag to the bag. She had to verify my name to do this. For some reason the woman at the counter was expecting me to be some other passenger. She asked me ‚ÄúGifford?‚Äù and I replied no and told her my last name. She insisted ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not Gifford??‚Äù and I again stated no and repeated my last name. She then asks ‚ÄúIs SOMEONE in your party named Gifford??‚Äù I said no for the third time so then it finally sank in with her, and she ignored me and started asking other attendants about her Gifford situation. I then boarded the plane with my wife and 22 month old daughter. While on the 6 hour flight my daughter began having a tantrum as is typical for these circumstances. I brought a tablet with some downloaded kids movies for my daughter to help in this expected situation, knowing that one of the most annoying situations on a plane is sitting near a kid having a tantrum. But I know the tablet works like a charm to help my daughter calm down and improve the experience for other passengers, so I let her watch a show at a modest volume, quieter than nearby conversations I could easily overhear. The flight attendant saw that my 22 month old daughter was not using head phones and reprimanded my wife for ‚Äúdisturbing‚Äù other passengers with the tablet speaker, which by the way was significantly quieter than the tantrum happening a minute prior. So the attendant ends up bringing head phones to my wife, requiring my daughter to wear these. As many parents know, trying to force a 22 month old to put those on after a tantrum, will simply prolong the tantrum.  So now instead of controlling the situation, my daughter went back to actually annoying passengers and I now had fewer options to help the issue. After the dust settled a passenger across the aisle from me said she couldn‚Äôt even hear the tablet and was shocked the attendant was so inflexible in dealing with these issues. The third issue was on our return flight. I purchased three seats, for my wife, my daughter and myself. As we were preparing to take off, my daughter was sitting on my wife‚Äôs lap, leaving the middle seat empty other than one of our jackets. The flight attendant walks by for the pre-flight check and asks if we‚Äôre all traveling together. I respond yes and he asks if my daughter is a lap child. I didn‚Äôt know where he was going with this and was confused by the questioning. Lap child? Yes she‚Äôs on my wife‚Äôs lap. He then tells me I need to switch to middle seat since we‚Äôre together. He wrongly assumed we were taking up three seats and only purchased two. False, I paid for all three. He asked if I purchased all the seats. Yes. I did. Why are we having this conversation? Everyone is already seated anyway. I was just perplexed at the whole ordeal. Why must you make this awkward? He quietly walked away after our brief conversation."
1138,"Have a business class ticket and had access to complimentary preferred seating, which I didn't know doesn't exist in business class. The customer service rep was rude and had one word answers for all of my questions. Silence for a while after I ask the question and one word answers with a tone of lack of interest. Didn't have the interest to acknowledge and respond in a polite positive tone. Would never recommend buying flights with them if you had a similar duration/fare flights."
1139,"Terrible experience. My daughter's flight from RDU to JFK was cancelled  on 12/30/17, 80 minutes before it was scheduled to leave. She was already at the airport when she was notified. When she called for assistance, the ticket agents were rude and uncaring. They eventually (unapologetically) booked her on a flight the next day. When she asked about any kind of compensation, they told her she had to go online and register her complaint. She did that and has not heard anything more from them. Neither my daughter nor I will ever fly American again if we can possible avoid it."
1140,Currently 12:40 am just landed and we have to wait 20+ minutes to even get to our gate. Rediculous. On top of that the WiFi was terrible that I paid 10 bucks for. Was trying to watch a movie the whole freight and it was buffering.
1141,Had some good and bad experiences. Prefer Jet Blue and some of the other airlines. Average is where I put AA
1142,"My wife and I flew from JFK to London Heathrow on (flight AA100) Nov 20th 2017. I found the experience to be very possitive, thanks to American Airlines member of staff, Jesus Cuello.. who sorted out an issue we had before boarding the aircraft. I am giving American Airlines a 5 star rating because of the actions of Mr Cuello from JFK airport.Many Thanks.Josephine and Michael."
1143,"We were flying from DFW which is a large airport and v drove 3 hrs to the airport and had to leave the rental car which is far away from the teeminal and planned to get their 2 hrs early but with the traffic and other things v arrived @ 7:10 when our flight was at 8:20. So i took the checkin bag and all the lugguage and went to the terminal.My infant and husband were  returning the car and were taking another shuttle.As soon as I reached to the counter , they wasted 5 mins initially and then told me the system is locked and cant checkin any more bags. So i asked them if v can put it in the next flight they said no and were not giving any options. But this is not the case with any other flight they usually just send it across in the next flight. We called in the morning to add the infant on lap and when we decided that 1 of us will go with the baby they wasted few minutes there and said cant add her anymore. This was all completed by 40 mins prior to the flight time and we wud have still catched the flight but they did not give us any options except for moving us to the next flight that was in the morning. V already travelled 3 hrs to the airport and had to be stranded there next 12hrs. When we walked around and moved to another terminal that when a lady came asked about the baby gave us pillows nd blankets offered to warm up the milk and get some food for the baby. And only when we were asking pepl they told us 1 of us can go in and get the food before the food counters close. The AA team was least bothered to help us in anyway. Next day when we were boarding v were standing right there and were not asked to board in early with the baby only when a copassenger suggested and i went and asked them they let usin. The 1 star is for the flight crew who were really sweet and the lady that helped us @ the terminal and the lady that checked our bag in the morning. I am never goin to this flight again nor will I suggest to any1. It worked out well when i was travelling alone but with a baby/checked bag and especially @ the DFW airport i wud never take that risk again. Sorry for the long review but i have never reviewed any1 negetively."
1144,"i have used AMERICAN AIRLINES more times than I would like to admit. and EVERY single time, imean EVERY SINGLE TIME i used AA,  my flight has been delayed or cancelled ,, and when i tried to find out why my flight was delayed I got rude attitude from the lady behind the AA desk.  I go out of my way now to use other airlines.."
1145,"AA cancelled my flight. It was 4 days after hurricane Irma. There was a lot of traffic going to and from Miami airport. All they did was send me an email and give me a telephone number that was never picked up. Because my mother put so much effort in telephone calles from the Netherlands she succeeded in putting me on another flight with AA from Lima to Miami and further on. But I had to wait 3 full days in Lima.No help, no contact no nothing. They even are not gonna refund me for the extra hotelnights and food etc for these 3 extra days.What a lousy company. And then they dare to say they were the best airline of the year??? Never ever go with them again, because you cannot trust them"
1146,"American Airlines did a FANTASTIC JOB at making this THE WORST EXPERIENCE OF.MY.LIFE. Greedy corp oversells EVERY FLIGHT THEN MAKES UP RIDICULOUS ROUTES TO SEND YOU ON (as if you don't mind flying in circles). I have experienced the most blatant racism, rudeness and unprofessionalism across the board all in one trip! They lie to you about availabilities just to get you from their counter. Then you're told by customer service to "" just FORGET ABOUT IT"" If I could rate a minus 5 stars I would. THAT would be more truth than those phony ads that claim they aim to make this experience great..PLEASE! üòïüòï"
1147,This has to be the worse Airline in the World booked our Flights thru Vegas.com and of course they put us on American Airline We flew from Atlanta to Chicago to Vegas I thought it was the worst experience I would ever have but I was wrong the flight back was even worse after flying from Vegas to Charlotte we barely made our connecting fly to Atlanta we had 2 carry on bags all the way from Atlanta to Vegas and back to Charlotte got to Charlotte and we had to check a bag well get to Atlanta and they broke my strap on my bag after getting off the plane I told them about it and they said go to Baggage Claim believe me after being in Airports all damn day I was not about to spend one more minute in any Airport also the flight crew had to be the rudest crews I have ever run into I will never ever fly with this 3rd rate Airline again.....
1148,"Every time I have a bad experience with another airline, I am reminded how more or less consistent AA is in their customer service and overall experience. Being a frequent flyer and Platinum status holder with American Airlines, I am overall pleased being their customer. I only wish that they had more partner Airlines and especially ones that fly internationally."
1149,I had the pleasure of speaking to a Customer Service Supervisor that turned a bad experience to a five star experience. I truly appreciate representatives that can find a win-win solution to problems.
1150,"Total chaos... we booked a flight from Dallas to NYC. The day afterwards we find out that they don't take a non-American credit card (fyi, basically every company in the world including Southwest, Spirit etc. does). We were sitting for one hour on the phone with a person at customer service who tried several cards, none of them worked with American Airlines (worked fine otherwise). Their Paypal option also didn't work. It was impossible. In the end, we had to book with Southwest which worked fine."
1151,"The service is really average. Gladly, there was no flight delay and the check in process was easy but the fact that there is no free access to movies and no food included in the ticket price made me disappointed."
1152,"Traveled from Philadelphia to Heathrow on 8-22-17. Excellent service, on board food was good and plentiful. Smooth landing upon arrival. No complaints here, thank you American Airlines!"
1153,"American Airlines forced to pay $26 us Dollar for your baggage if you pass 1 inch, that was in Zacatecas Mexico, that is not a good customer service.very disappointed."
1154,Flight attendant Michele Jones goes over and beyond to be a positive ambassador for American Airlines. You should feel lucky to have such a dedicated employee.
1155,"Today, Thursday 8/3/17, I spoke with the ticket agent COREY through the reservation portal who was rude and impatient in handling my reservation. She was difficult to hear and understand as if she had something in her mouth, rapid fire speech and spoke poorly. A very poor service indeed. I recommend her removal from this position."
1156,We had to wait about 3hours because our flight got delayed and the reason for the delay was because they had to find a plane when (1) there was one plane already at the gate and (2) there's thousands of planes on the field yet they can't choose not 1 and while I'm sitting here writing the report our delayed flight increased so now we're waiting even moreThis was a horrible experience never again American Airlines
1157,"I wasnt expecting this- a pleasant experience!We travelled from Edinburgh to JFK.The gate was advised to us at bag drop. and an announcement was made in good time to get there.We were embarked in groups, which were noted on boarding cards- a very organised sort of system.Have to say the economy cabin was nothing special and definitely economy compared to the same class BA-if we hadnt bought additional leg room seats him indoors would have been a pain!The cabin was very like your average internal UK flight plane, but very cleanStaff professional but maybe not as friendly as say ThomsonLunch was quite good- moist chunks of chicken in rice which was over done, drinks included red wine, water, tea.Service was on time throughout, and disembark was well organised"
1158,"best airline in north americai have to admit that i had reservations against the airline. one year ago i flew hkg to lax and i had one of the best flight experiences ever. food was good, the seat distance was good and the service was great. since then i tried to use aa more and more and i am still a loyal customer. aa also has attractive prices if you can wait and choose your time. no other airline has an app like aa. it is by far the best in the industry"
1159,"I'm a real disappointed Client. Don't buy any of their Vacation Packages. They said that you're saving money, but then they charge you 40 dollars for a Second checked bag , bought  a 9 days package  ( fly and hotel and also activities ) . But then in a very small print they tell you that you're  allowed only one bag .I'm traveling with my wife and we have to spend 160 dollars more. Never will use this airline again.Believe me they don't Care about Your Customer Experience."
1160,"Flying with American Airlines was a fantastic experience.  My gate changed upon arrival to my connecting flight and the customer service was extremely helpful in instructing me of what I was required to do. Upon my return it was touch and go whether I was going to make my connection due to a late departure, but with the help of the flight staff, directions from an American Airline Ambassador and great timing I made my connection.  And I don't know how they pulled it off in such a short period of time, but my luggage made the connection also.  Well done American Airlines, I will certainly fly with you again."
1161,"We flew from Manchester to Philadelphia International direct for a 2 week holiday. We flew on Tuesday 2nd May and returned Monday 15th May. The plane was very clean and very modern (screens in the back of the seats with movies, music and TV). The plane was only about 1/3 to 1/2 full, so we were able to all spread out and have some space. The aircrew were really attentive and helpful, constantly offering drinks (all for free) and the food (cottage pie) was lovely! Flying back, we had a 3 hour delay due to a plane breaking down in Europe, so they had to shuffle their fleet around. We did get free food and drinks Philadelphia Airport though, and again the plane back was clean and modern. The crew were very welcoming and attentive, and we were fortunate enough to be able to spread out due to the plane not being fully booked. The food on the return wasn't as nice as flying out (breakfast was just a yogurt, a muffin and a small packet of granola) but the dinner was much better (chicken and rice).Will use again if flying to America!"
1162,I am on flight 2101 and the flight have been delayed numerous time. Without no legitimate explanation. Customer service is horrible. Nobody wants to assit except telling us that as soon as they get information they will forward it to us.  Customer service and the agent in St. Louis Lambert airport  is horrible.As soon as the screen continiusly changes departure time. The agent walks away because they don't wants  answer any question. This is one of if not the worst flight I have ever experienced on American and I recommend other airlines. This is just unacceptable. This services is the worst.
1163,Flight 1285 gate agent Luis was very helpful. Agents like him makes the traveling experience better. Thanks
1164,"The staff on my last flight was wonderful. The only reason for the ""poor"" review has to do with the POOR planning and organization by the management. We flew into LAX on April 29, 2017, on flight AA2598 from Jamaica which requires all passengers to go thru Customs and yet our plane was sent a gate with NO access to customs. We were forced to sit on the tarmac for over an hour before they found working stairs so we to get off the plane and onto a bus. Sadly after buying a first class ticket, we were forced to be some of the last to get off the plane because the genius's at Amercian Airlines insist on putting to stairs at the rear of the plane. I'll never buy first class/Bussiness class if I'm gonna get a coach experience!"
1165,"I flied with my family in April 10, 2017. Company gave us last seats which don't tilt back, it was sorely. The one of stewardess was so rude, I don't remember her name. But Darnel, stewardess was very sympathic, only because of her I marked 5 score to that flight."
1166,I have used the AA three times so far in less then a year. Each time they have been quick in coming out to me and provided excellent service. Recently the man who came out to me went above and beyond to help me.  Their mechanics have been great.  Nothing is ever too much trouble.  I would definitely recommend and will be still sticking with them.
1167,"Worst customer service ever at MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - I was going to fly from Miami to Toronto on Jan. 6th with my twp boys. One of them traveled from Toronto to Miami as an infant (less than 2) and turned 2 during the trip. After waking up super early and getting them ready, and after doing a huge line... the lady who ""helped"" us - her name is Luisa (they don't use last names in their tags) - said... Oh they (AA) did not noticed my baby was not an infant and did not reserve a seat.... I am sorry but you cannot fly today. Next they offered me a ""SOLUTION"" flying to Dallas and then waiting 4 hours in Dallas and then other 7 to go to Toronto... not an option with 2 kids... their other solution was then you can travel directly on Jan. 12th - meaning I am here STUCK in Miami for 6 more days... because of their mistake and they don't even say SORRY!They did not offer any compensations or any help either!"
1168,"Dont bother with them. Go to RAC, Green flag etc instead. They dont deserve your business as have no interest in customer service.After autorenewing at a joke of a price, they wouldnt refund fully and took ¬£20 admin fee from me.I will be cancelling my home cover too as a result.Update - a second call to AA and I am given a different answer saying I shouldnt have been charged the ¬£20. They have to send a cheque however. Upgraded from 1 star to 2 stars as a result"
1169,"We have had insurance for years and needed help twice while overseas.  We gave up the first time and sorted it ourselves, but this year we had major issue and needed support.  Phone communication was mostly from our end and although they sorted things eventually, it took a lot of phone calls from us to keep momentum going and resolve the problem."
1170,"At renewal time I checked my online accounts  with the AA and major panic it said that the previous year policy had been cancelled. Had I not been insured for the previous year? I phoned and checked, it was all right I was insured, but received my documents in the post so the online statement was incorrect. Was I happy for the renewal to go ahead, I said yes, little did I know they debited my account  there and then. I looked for my documents and found a copy on my computer. My panic again where as my previous insurance was ¬£207 it was now ¬£300. I rang the AA, why the increase? They said the rates of other companies had increased by 30% (NOT TRUE FOR THE 60+ GROUPS THE INCREASE WAS SMALLEST) after some discussion and recalculating I could now have my insurance for ¬£240. Whoops I had already paid so the ¬£60 pounds could not be refunded, this made me very happy. I was phoned back and told they could refund ¬£18, better than a slap in the face I suppose, but I still felt that a job had been done on a AA member with 26 years membership and a gold sticker to prove it."
1171,"I couldnt fault them, a ¬£200 policy, which i am ashamed to say i tryed to get reduced as i stupidly though was to much. i drove a ¬£700 car through france, it broke down and just as i thought my holiday was over. the AA put a smile back on my face.car shipped back to my home in UK, Me taxied to my hotels, ¬£1000 worth of taxi's and a hire car to come home in, three phone calls every day to see if i was ok, offered to book hotels and taxis. Like personal assistants, Guardian angels. The girls on the phone were very calm and helpful, translated for me as i dont speek any french,  i loved my holiday, but with out the AA it would have been a nightmare. Dont Travel Without it. you wont be sorry. In hign sight i would pay ¬£1000 for AA european cover."
1172,"I have purchased their so called ""mechanical breakdown cover"" through Car Giant. I can't believe how stupid I was. As soon as something goes wrong they do everything to get out of covering you. Their so called ""approved garage"" tried to tell me that my diesel fuel is contaminated with petrol and this is the reason for the engine breakdown. I have taken it to an independent garage who confirmed that this is an absolute rubbish. AA refused to cover the  cost of the repair in full as I have taken my car to ""non AA approved"" garage. They have also said that ""I must use"" the engine from ""their approved"" manufacturer and this is not even a BMW engine!!! This will automatically make my car decrease in value but they don't give a d***n about it. It's been 5 weeks since my car is a non-runner and AA just keeps delaying things. They have sent me a letter to ""fob me off"" which literally tells me to go and complain elsewhere. Absolute shambol!!! I had known that this is how it's going to end I would have never spent all of that money on purchasing the policy in a first place. I am taking things to FCA and the Financial Ombudsman right now. I will not let them get away with this. I will complain  to the Pope if I have to and I will wallpaper the internet with my experience as people should be warned about this scam!"
1173,"At  MIA Gabby was supposed to assist me with getting on an earlier flight to CLT, she printed a new boarding pass, tore up my old one only to discover once I had boarded the plane that she had given me the wrong one. They said that they were not able to get me on the flight because it was too late. If she was competent when I came before boarding, I would have made the flight. Then they blamed me for not checking the name...what a terrible crew and poor customer service."
1174,"My car wouldn't start at home. I have AA home start breakdown cover so I rang them up (on a Sunday morning) and within the hour the patrol had reached me, found I had a flat battery, sold me a new one and replaced. The car has been fine since. Furthermore the chap who came round was very pleasant."
1175,Absolutely appalling behaviour by AA and their ground staff! Wrong terminal on boarding pass change within 20 minutes of departure resulting in a missed flights .. But they felt it ok to sell out seats to standby passengers how great for them extra revenue ! And then they put us on on standby no assured seats and little or no help! One ratty haired dismissive supervisor who needs to learn some customer services skills ! And how do you not off load bags for passengers who do not get on the flight . I take it 9/11 thought you nothing !
1176,"Beware - if you fly American either pay for a checked bag OR pay for priority boarding..  On a crowded flight you will not get to keep your bag with you unless you have priority boarding (extra cost).  All non priority flyers get a ""Group 3"" status boarding pass and they even warn you that you will need to give the agent your bag (no cost though) if the flight is crowded.  Uninitiated passengers don't realize that having a ""Group three"" boarding pass is anyone who has not paid extra (not the usual front 1/3 of plane) so by the time you are called the bins are mostly full AND  some attendants are  angry that you haven't heeded the call to give them your bag and  are very hostile.  Possibly it was just our attendants on our return flight who were on the lazy side and didn't want to get into the ""stuffing"" bags into crowded bins which is an unpleasant but normal part of their duties.  The attendants were very helpful on the out bound flight. Once  we boarded our flight an attendant told us the bins were full (we had not paid extra for priority boarding) and our bags were taken from us without even a proof of the bags being removed from our care.  We were in the last seats on the plane and saw  at least 8 places in bins which would have accommodated our bags and saw other flyers  with the same style bags entering after us use these spaces.  Once seated I remembered my purse with a large sum of money , checks, car keys laptops etc. were in the bags taken but I couldn't get back up to the front of plane to get the items.  At no point did the attendant give us an opportunity to remove valuables.  Usually attendants work to help passengers find storage for their bags as long as the bin is open with space available.  Exactly how the agent decided to take our bags and not the later flyers (not flyers arriving late from connections) I'll never know.  By the time I could get the attendant's attention the bags were gone.  All ended well as the bags were delivered with the checked bags but not before I had spent a very angry several hours during the flight.. In truth I would have gladly paid the priority boarding fee if I had understood what the scam was.  I travel frequently but usually on Delta or other airlines and had not traveled on AA in a number of years - believe me I won't travel on AA again. Flight 0232 out of ATI-DFW  Oct 27th absolutely full but no problemsFlight 1487 out of DFW-ATL Oct 28th badly handled by  staff. George M RainesAnn Bowers"
1177,"I‚Äôve booked my flights with US Airways (which is part of American Airlines now) and had the worse experienced ever.  Not only my original flight was cancelled and rebooked flight was delayed at least 4 times which forced me to rebook it for the following day because none of the connection flights could be catch.  Also, all other flights were delayed, so it was the worse trip I had ever took because of the flight trouble.  When I sent an email to customer service of American Airlines and explained the whole situation and said that I had to spend extra on taxi rides all they had to say is that they apologize for inconvenience and appreciate the feedback.  However, no one offered any type of reimbursement for taxi fare that I was force to take to and from airports because of the flight cancellations and delays.  Very unhappy with customer service and won‚Äôt be using them for any of my and my employers for future business trips."
1178,Good customer service. Helpful but strict with the luggage weight. Terminal has WiFi and Starbucks. Overall I had a decent experience.
1179,"I recently flew to usa leaving my wife with 8 kids inc baby home thus cutting the trip to as short as possible. the night before returning to London at around 1am just before I was going to sleep after a very heavy day, and planning to get up around 6am, I thought I should check my flight statues , so I called up the usa office but could only speak to automated system, which after pressing a few buttons informed me that my flight was cancelled.!I thought I wasn‚Äôt hearing well!I didn‚Äôt get any notice what‚Äôs so ever! No email no phone call no text message! - which they had the contacts!I didn‚Äôt know where to start and was determent to get home asap, and as my flight was the last for that morning I was hoping to be able to get onto an earlier flight.So I started calling and calling and calling any number that I could find relevant but to no avail. No one answered the phone, so I called my travel agent who picked up the phone from India or somewhere.At first they didn‚Äôt even know about the cancellation and it took a few calls back and forth till we found out, then they told me they can‚Äôt do anything till the offices in London open which is my time 4- which by this time was almost.4am they told me that they will have to wait till British airway open in London which is my time 6 am, but I argued with them that by then I won‚Äôt make it to an earlier flight if anything is available, but they couldn't help me and so I was dragged on with phone calls back and forth till 6am when they spoke to British airways.By the time they got an answer for me it was obviously to late and the only chance would have been Monday night which meant arriving Tuesday morning or Tuesday afternoon at my doorstep.So to sum it up; I was up all night just to be informed that I won‚Äôt be able to make it in the morning and that I had to stay.At around 7am I went to sleep but not for long as the noise in the hallways started soon after.I had to call my car hire & phone Hire Company to inform them of my delay in returning.I had no fresh clothing for an additional day, so I had to run out and buy, I also didn‚Äôt have where to stay as my host was going away for a family affair and nowhere to eat.My wife was devastated to be on her own for longer especially when a few of my kids developed a bug and where vomiting all day staying home and not going to school.As director of a company i obviously lost a lot simply by not being in my office another day, but I lost even more as i missed the annual show which is the main source of my business, and for which I had arranged several appointments as well as a train ticket, which was all missed due to the cancellation.My rescheduled flight was supposed to be 10:50pm but even that had a 50 minute delay so further delaying my arrival to London.Being religious I cannot eat other than special meal which I make sure to book when booking my ticket, but after all this hassle I didn‚Äôt even have to the right to eat something as there was no special meal available and I had to starve from around 8pm till next day 3 pm when I reached my door in London!So to sum up ‚Äì I had to be without sleep for two nights (and this is the reason I originally booked a day flight as I can‚Äôt sleep on a plane) and without food for about 13 hours, and miss not only another day‚Äôs work and important meetings, but even the following day (Wednesday) I was knocked out!I also had to pay extra for my Car park in Heathrow London for an over stay.when i contacted American airlines and sent them a few emails they didnt even respond!!!only after contacting the USA travel regulator did they take notice of me!they started with open blunt lies saying that due to the weather the flight was cancelled!!! the weather was more then perfect, and all my friends who came for the same occasion traveled normally on that very day and time with different airlines!they did send me a $100 voucher towards the next trip, which is not going to happen for two reasons, 1. i have no reason generally to travel there, 2. & more importantly i am not going to travel with them again!but my argument fell on deaf ears as they never responded to me again.so if you don't want to suffer what i did, don't touch american airlines ever!"
1180,aa is the worse when you looking to resolve a problem I bought a ticket with the miles and they charge me 85 us dollars but happen a medical problem and I cancel the trip ...when I call for reinstall the miles I have to pay 150.00 us dollars ....redeemed 37k miles and re install is cost 235 us dollars with no travel...... I spoke to supervisor and she recommend to go to customer relationship and make a complain before to start helping me.....is very sad to go to the worse to get help.
1181,"I had a flight from Miami to Costa Rica 2 weeks ago, and it was a really nice flight. I need a lot of leg room, but that was not a problem. Every seat had plenty of leg room and in general the flight was pretty awesome. Would definitly fly American Airlines again!"
1182,"Miami to Guatemala, service desk would not let us on an earlier flight even though it was not leaving for 3 hours, was half full and our flight was still 9 hours out. 9 hours later, hysteria at the gate and a angry black woman yelling at people in Spanish over the paging system. flight is late and we have no idea why because no announcement in English. This is in Miami. I went to another gate after we could not reach a customer service agent on their 800 customer service line. The other gate refused to talk to us until I threatened to bring over a  nearby police officer.  They angry black women there explained that the plane had a malfunction, they where going to place the sold out flight onto a smaller plane and that I better get in the hysterical line to get a boarding pass before the mass of people speaking Spanish got them all. I went to the AA kisok and demanded that they print us boarding passes since we had no idea we were supposed to be in any line since there was never an announcement in English.  We got on the plane about 2 hours late but it sat for another hour... then the pilot came on and said there would be a delay... at least he said it in English too this time. Bags from someone who did not get on the flight had been loaded and they would have to get theme off the flight before we left. About 7 pm, 4-5 Union Slugs pulled up beside the aircraft and immediately inserted their thumbs in their own behinds and sipped coffee and ate their lunches. once in awhile one of them would jump out of their warm truck cab and come closer to the plane but never did one actually do any work. It wasn't until about 9 pm when a supervisor arrived... who looked lie he had been called in from home and was ON FIRE, that these Union Slugs started pulling bags off the plane, process took about 2 more hours, they pulled every bag off the plane, found the offending bags, replaced the rest and we finally took off, about 7 hours late, for Guatemala.  At the end of our trip, from Peru to Denver, we ditched the AA tickets and found a combination of South American airlines into Dallas then Frontier to Denver. We explained the issues to American but they refused to refund the unused tickets. they denied the issues even happened on the way to South America and in Miami.  A few months ago, after we had booked a trip on a sailing ship in Barbados, we discovered the only way to get there was on AA. We were disgusted but bought the tickets against our better judgment. As expected, the flights were plagued with delays, switching of gates without explanation, etc. The highlight was a gate change where the entire flight had to make their way half way across the airport and into another concourse. All the customers made it but one large angry black women, an American Worker, could not find the flight and caused a 45 minute delay. My wife and I have vowed to never book any travel until we have confirmed we can get there without flying American (and now US Airways) and we can avoid Miami Airport. There is no place on earth we need to see so badly that we would fly American again. Worst part... American is willing to take the loss, they will not acknowledge the issue In our case and their corporate culture is a septic tank. Watch out US Airways customers, The poisonous American Airlines corporate culture is sure to destroy that airline as well."
1183,"I booked a vacation package through a third party company. That company was not that great also, but the worst part of the trip was only one flight with American Airlines. I had a flight from Chicago to LA, first, I was not able to choose my seats for the flights. I had a ticket for my wife and me, but the available seats (even a month before the flight) were in the middle of three seats only. I tried to change it during check-in, the very unpleasing, annoying, stressed woman at the O'hare airport told me it is impossible and she was very rude. (We ended up sitting separately) Since I was trying to catch the plane, I did not argue with her. But the awful service did not cease. When I was on the line for security check, another annoying woman came and told me in a very rude way that I needed to check in my carry on baggage. I said to her that I have to run for the flight and might not catch the plane, she continued her rude attitude and forced me to leave the line and check-in the carry on baggage. (I took the same baggage with all other airlines to other flights with no problem, because it was in allowed sizes) I found out that the first woman actually sent the latter one to force me to check in the baggage just to make me pay $25. I had a similar problem earlier with this company for an international flight, when I had to use this airline as a part of my overseas trip. They charged me for the second luggage, even the actual airline (THY) that had an agreement with AA for domestic flights clearly allowed for two pieces. I came to the conclusion that AA would do anything to steal $25 or $50 from every passenger. After first experience, I had been determined not to use this airline, but since it was only one flight of my vacation package I thought it would be OK. But I was clearly wrong. I had two flights with this company, and I will never use it again. I would not recommend this airline to anyone who do not like stingy companies that do not value their customers. Awful service, awful employees."
1184,"I have flown with AA for perhaps 20 years now, on a recent flight from Denver to San Francisco I was appalled at the cleanliness of the aircraft. Standards are certainly slipping over the years which is a shame."
1185,"They are a big company getting bigger= more trouble dealing with individual customers. I fly them 4X a year and its the same song and dance each time, a old plane with some kind of newer technology somewhat able to sneak by. Biggest issue I have is that there is never ever enough room to sit on any of there planes unless you pay to upgrade."
1186,"I used AA for an internal flight between Orlando and Miami, I was very impressed with the Self Check in Facility, Flight was uneventful, There was a general sense you were in good experienced hands. in contrast to the doom and gloom your not getting any sleep on our night flight to Dublin with Aerlingus.  I will definitely fly AA again."
1187,"Our experience was very good. Very efficient.And our airplanes of AA was better than all airplanes of spain.We was traveling in a delayed flight and we have to choose another to come to spain. The put a special bus to do not go across all airport and we was afraid of luggages, but the luggages arrive with us. No problem."
1188,"They're in bankruptcy but I think they're fine--get me where I want to go, almost never had much delay. Free wifi until 2/16/2012"
1189,"I got an mail from them and i even dont know them it said i had an ticket, mailed with an zip i scanned the zip and surprise surprise it was an virus im glad i always scan before i download  aa.com you get 0 out of 5  Reason: Tryed to send me an virus"
1190,Easiest to use.  Fast.  Quick.  Easy.
1191,"American actually has fantastic functionality, particularly for Advantage members, which at the end of the day is what really matters for getting value from the site. Yes its clunky, yes the interface is not slick, but it would be a nightmare to overhaul, and I can do 95% of what I need to do with my American bookings right there on the site. Most critically, finding and booking reward flights is very quick, and very easy."
1192,"Never had a good experience with AA. Poor customer service, poor management, site often fails."
