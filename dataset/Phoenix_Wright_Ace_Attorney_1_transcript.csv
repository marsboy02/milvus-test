The first turnabout,1,0,Phoenix,(Boy am I nervous!)
The first turnabout,1,1,Mia,Wright!
The first turnabout,1,2,Phoenix,"Oh, h-hiya, Chief."
The first turnabout,1,3,Mia,"Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well."
The first turnabout,1,4,Phoenix,"Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor."
The first turnabout,1,5,Mia,"A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?"
The first turnabout,1,6,Phoenix,"Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney."
The first turnabout,1,7,Mia,"Well, that's news to me!"
The first turnabout,1,8,Phoenix,"I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him, I owe him that much."
The first turnabout,1,9,Butz,"(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)"
The first turnabout,1,10,Mia,... Isn't that your client screaming over there?
The first turnabout,1,11,Phoenix,Yeah... that's him.
The first turnabout,1,12,Butz,"(Death! Despair! Ohhhh! I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die!!!)"
The first turnabout,1,13,Mia,It sounds like he wants to die...
The first turnabout,1,14,Phoenix,"Um, yeah. *sigh*"
The first turnabout,1,15,Butz,Nick!!!
The first turnabout,1,16,Phoenix,"Hey. Hey there, Larry."
The first turnabout,1,17,Butz,"Dude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!"
The first turnabout,1,18,Phoenix,"What!? What's wrong, Larry?"
The first turnabout,1,19,Butz,"Oh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?"
The first turnabout,1,20,Phoenix,(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)
The first turnabout,1,21,Judge,The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.
The first turnabout,1,22,Payne,"The prosecution is ready, Your Honor."
The first turnabout,1,23,Phoenix,"The, um, defense is ready, Your Honor."
The first turnabout,1,24,Judge,"Ahem. Mr. Wright? This is your first trial, is it not?"
The first turnabout,1,25,Phoenix,"Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous."
The first turnabout,1,26,Judge,"Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves."
The first turnabout,1,27,Phoenix,"Thank... thank you, Your Honor."
The first turnabout,1,28,Judge,"... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness."
The first turnabout,1,29,Phoenix,Y-Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)
The first turnabout,1,30,Judge,This test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.
The first turnabout,1,31,Phoenix,"The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor."
The first turnabout,1,32,Judge,"Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?"
The first turnabout,1,33,Phoenix,"(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)"
The first turnabout,1,34,Mia,Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?
The first turnabout,1,35,Phoenix,"Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily."
The first turnabout,1,36,Mia,"I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just touch the Court Record button to check it at anytime, okay? Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you."
The first turnabout,1,37,Judge,Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?
The first turnabout,1,38,Phoenix,Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.
The first turnabout,1,39,Judge,"Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?"
The first turnabout,1,40,Phoenix,"She was struck once, by a blunt object."
The first turnabout,1,41,Judge,"Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you."
The first turnabout,1,42,Phoenix,"Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)"
The first turnabout,1,43,Judge,"Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?"
The first turnabout,1,44,Payne,"Yes, Your Honor?"
The first turnabout,1,45,Judge,"As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that ""object"" was?"
The first turnabout,1,46,Payne,"The murder weapon was this statue of ""The Thinker."" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim."
The first turnabout,1,47,Judge,I see... the court accepts it into evidence.
The first turnabout,1,48,Mia,Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. Touch the Court Record button to check the Court Record frequently.
The first turnabout,1,49,Judge,"Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness."
The first turnabout,1,50,Payne,"The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand."
The first turnabout,1,51,Phoenix,"Um, Chief, what do I do now?"
The first turnabout,1,52,Mia,"Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate."
The first turnabout,1,53,Phoenix,"(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.)"
The first turnabout,1,54,Payne,Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?
The first turnabout,1,55,Butz,"Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!"
The first turnabout,1,56,Phoenix,(Um... didn't they all die?)
The first turnabout,1,57,Butz,"I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?"
The first turnabout,1,58,Payne,"Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by ""dumped."" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!"
The first turnabout,1,59,Butz,"Whaddya mean, ""one of them""!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!"
The first turnabout,1,60,Payne,"Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died."
The first turnabout,1,61,Judge,"Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder."
The first turnabout,1,62,Butz,Dude... no way...
The first turnabout,1,63,Payne,"The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several ""Sugar Daddies."""
The first turnabout,1,64,Butz,Daddies? Sugar?
The first turnabout,1,65,Payne,"Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle."
The first turnabout,1,66,Butz,Duuude!
The first turnabout,1,67,Payne,"We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?"
The first turnabout,1,68,Mia,Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.
The first turnabout,1,69,Phoenix,(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions.)
The first turnabout,1,70,Phoenix,(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
The first turnabout,1,71,Payne,"Well, Mr. Butz?"
The first turnabout,1,72,Butz,"Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!"
The first turnabout,1,73,Phoenix,My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!
The first turnabout,1,74,Payne,Oof! *wince*
The first turnabout,1,75,Butz,"Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, ""irrelevant""!? That cheatin' she-dog!"
The first turnabout,1,76,Butz,"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!"
The first turnabout,1,77,Judge,"Let's continue with the trial, shall we?"
The first turnabout,1,78,Payne,I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.
The first turnabout,1,79,Judge,"Yes, quite."
The first turnabout,1,80,Phoenix,(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)
The first turnabout,1,81,Payne,"Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?"
The first turnabout,1,82,Butz,Gulp!
The first turnabout,1,83,Payne,"Well, did you, or did you not?"
The first turnabout,1,84,Butz,"Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!"
The first turnabout,1,85,Phoenix,(Uh oh. He went.)
The first turnabout,1,86,Phoenix,(I know! I'll send him a signal...)
The first turnabout,1,87,Phoenix,(TELL THE TRUTH)
The first turnabout,1,88,Butz,Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!
The first turnabout,1,89,Judge,"Order! Well, Mr. Butz?"
The first turnabout,1,90,Butz,"Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her."
The first turnabout,1,91,Payne,Objection.gif
The first turnabout,1,92,Payne,"Your Honor, the defendant is lying."
The first turnabout,1,93,Judge,Lying?
The first turnabout,1,94,Payne,The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.
The first turnabout,1,95,Judge,"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"
The first turnabout,1,96,Payne,The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!
The first turnabout,1,97,Judge,"Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness."
The first turnabout,1,98,Payne,"Yes, Your Honor."
The first turnabout,1,99,Phoenix,(This is bad...)
The first turnabout,1,100,Payne,"On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!"
The first turnabout,1,101,Payne,"Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?"
The first turnabout,1,102,Sahwit,"Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!"
The first turnabout,1,103,Judge,"Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder."
The first turnabout,1,104,Judge,"Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?"
The first turnabout,1,105,Payne,"Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building."
The first turnabout,1,106,Judge,Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?
The first turnabout,1,107,Payne,"Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal."
The first turnabout,1,108,Judge,"Now, Mr. Wright..."
The first turnabout,1,109,Phoenix,"Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?"
The first turnabout,1,110,Judge,You may begin your cross-examination.
The first turnabout,1,111,Phoenix,"C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?"
The first turnabout,1,112,Mia,"Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!"
The first turnabout,1,113,Phoenix,Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?
The first turnabout,1,114,Mia,"Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!"
The first turnabout,1,115,Phoenix,Lies! What?! He was lying!?
The first turnabout,1,116,Mia,"Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?"
The first turnabout,1,117,Phoenix,!!! How do I prove he's not?
The first turnabout,1,118,Mia,"You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!"
The first turnabout,1,119,Phoenix,Um... okay.
The first turnabout,1,120,Mia,Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!
The first turnabout,1,121,Sahwit,"I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment."
The first turnabout,1,122,Phoenix,Isn't a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him...
The first turnabout,1,123,Sahwit,"Er... heh. I don't know. He just seemed strange to me, that's all. Like he was mad, and yet frightened at the same time. Just like... a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime!"
The first turnabout,1,124,Phoenix,The defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture!
The first turnabout,1,125,Payne,"Of course. What the witness means is that the man he saw looked suspicious. So, what happened next?"
The first turnabout,1,126,Sahwit,I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
The first turnabout,1,127,Phoenix,Half-open... you say?
The first turnabout,1,128,Sahwit,"Yes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes. I watched for a moment, but no one came to close the door. ""That's odd, in a big city like this,"" I thought..."
The first turnabout,1,129,Payne,I see. And what happened next?
The first turnabout,1,130,Sahwit,"Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment."
The first turnabout,1,131,Phoenix,What gave you the idea to do that?
The first turnabout,1,132,Sahwit,"Well, the door was half-open, you see. Isn't it only human to want to... peek? We climb mountains because they are there! It's the same thing."
The first turnabout,1,133,Payne,Truer words have never been spoken! Anyone would look inside!
The first turnabout,1,134,Phoenix,(Hmm... why did Payne cut him off so quickly?)
The first turnabout,1,135,Payne,So you looked into the apartment. What happened then?
The first turnabout,1,136,Sahwit,Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
The first turnabout,1,137,Phoenix,Are you sure she was dead?
The first turnabout,1,138,Sahwit,"W-Well, no, I guess I wasn't. But, she wasn't moving at all, and there was blood everywhere."
The first turnabout,1,139,Phoenix,"(I guess that would look fatal to anyone...) Very well, what happened next?"
The first turnabout,1,140,Sahwit,I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
The first turnabout,1,141,Phoenix,"So, you didn't touch ANYTHING in the apartment?"
The first turnabout,1,142,Sahwit,"Um, yes. I mean no! Nothing."
The first turnabout,1,143,Phoenix,Okay. What happened next?
The first turnabout,1,144,Sahwit,I thought to call the police immediately!
The first turnabout,1,145,Phoenix,"You ""thought"" to call the police? Does that mean you didn't actually call them!?"
The first turnabout,1,146,Payne,"Please, please... Listen to the rest of the testimony. You thought to call the police... What happened next?"
The first turnabout,1,147,Sahwit,"However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working."
The first turnabout,1,148,Phoenix,The phone in her apartment wasn't working?
The first turnabout,1,149,Sahwit,"Yes. I mean, no, no it wasn't. Right."
The first turnabout,1,150,Phoenix,But you said you didn't go into the apartment... or did you!?
The first turnabout,1,151,Sahwit,"Oh, oh, that? I can explain that! There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway. I reached inside and tried using that to call..."
The first turnabout,1,152,Payne,"And the phone wasn't working, correct? What happened next?"
The first turnabout,1,153,Sahwit,I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
The first turnabout,1,154,Phoenix,Why use a public phone?
The first turnabout,1,155,Sahwit,"Well, you see, I don't have a cell phone. And, being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments."
The first turnabout,1,156,Phoenix,"Ah, right... what time did you call again?"
The first turnabout,1,157,Sahwit,I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The first turnabout,1,158,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
The first turnabout,1,159,Phoenix,1:00 PM! Are you certain?
The first turnabout,1,160,Sahwit,Yes. Absolutely.
The first turnabout,1,161,Phoenix,(Hmm... He seems really confident.)
The first turnabout,1,162,Mia,1:00 PM? Wright. Doesn't that seem strange to you? Present some evidence to contradict him!
The first turnabout,1,163,Phoenix,Objection.gif
The first turnabout,1,164,Phoenix,You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?
The first turnabout,1,165,Sahwit,"Yes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain."
The first turnabout,1,166,Phoenix,"Frankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report. The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM. There was nobody to... er... no ""body"" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?"
The first turnabout,1,167,Sahwit,"!!! Oh, that! Oh, er..."
The first turnabout,1,168,Payne,Objection.gif
The first turnabout,1,169,Payne,This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!
The first turnabout,1,170,Judge,"After his testimony, I find that hard to believe. Mr. Sahwit... Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?"
The first turnabout,1,171,Sahwit,"I.. er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!"
The first turnabout,1,172,Mia,"Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot! That's all you have to do: point out contradictions! Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!"
The first turnabout,1,173,Sahwit,Wait! I remember now!
The first turnabout,1,174,Judge,Would you care to give your testimony again?
The first turnabout,1,175,Mia,Wright! You know what to do!
The first turnabout,1,176,Phoenix,I've got this one.
The first turnabout,1,177,Sahwit,"You see, when I found the body, I heard the time."
The first turnabout,1,178,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
The first turnabout,1,179,Phoenix,"You said ""heard""... Not ""saw""?"
The first turnabout,1,180,Sahwit,"Yes, heard. All I saw was the body lying there... I didn't think to look at anything else, least of all my watch."
The first turnabout,1,181,Phoenix,"Hmm... Isn't that a little strange? So you're saying you ""heard"" something. But if you were so shocked by the body, you wouldn't hear anything at all!"
The first turnabout,1,182,Payne,Objection.gif
The first turnabout,1,183,Payne,"The witness did say he actually heard the time. It's ludicrous to suggest he ""wouldn't hear anything""!"
The first turnabout,1,184,Judge,"Hmm... I have to agree with the prosecution. Witness, continue your testimony."
The first turnabout,1,185,Sahwit,There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.
The first turnabout,1,186,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
The first turnabout,1,187,Phoenix,Are you sure it was a television and not... a radio?
The first turnabout,1,188,Sahwit,"Well, no, I guess it might have been a radio."
The first turnabout,1,189,Payne,"Incidentally, there was no radio on the premises. There was only one large television."
The first turnabout,1,190,Mia,"Wright! I can't put my finger on it, but something about this seems fishy. Something about ""hearing"" the television..."
The first turnabout,1,191,Payne,The witness has testified. He heard the time.
The first turnabout,1,192,Sahwit,"Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?"
The first turnabout,1,193,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
The first turnabout,1,194,Phoenix,How do you explain the gap!
The first turnabout,1,195,Judge,"Well, witness? Can you explain this?"
The first turnabout,1,196,Sahwit,I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!
The first turnabout,1,197,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
The first turnabout,1,198,Phoenix,A.. video?
The first turnabout,1,199,Sahwit,"Yes, that would explain why the time was wrong!"
The first turnabout,1,200,Phoenix,"True, true..."
The first turnabout,1,201,Mia,Wright! I think the problem lies someplace else...
The first turnabout,1,202,Judge,"We're agreed that you heard the time at the scene, then."
The first turnabout,1,203,Sahwit,That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!
The first turnabout,1,204,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
The first turnabout,1,205,Phoenix,Are you sure the voice you heard said it was 1:00 PM?
The first turnabout,1,206,Sahwit,"Yes, I can practically hear it now. It was quite clear."
The first turnabout,1,207,Judge,"Mr. Payne, has the prosecution verified this testimony?"
The first turnabout,1,208,Payne,"My apologies, Your Honor. I, too, have only just learned that the witness ""heard"" the time."
The first turnabout,1,209,Sahwit,"Oh, I'm really sorry. I only remembered it just now."
The first turnabout,1,210,Phoenix,Objection.gif
The first turnabout,1,211,Phoenix,Hold it right there! The prosecution has said there was a blackout at the time of the discovery! And this record proves it!
The first turnabout,1,212,Sahwit,...!
The first turnabout,1,213,Phoenix,You couldn't have heard a television... or a video!
The first turnabout,1,214,Sahwit,Gah!!! I... well... urk!
The first turnabout,1,215,Judge,"The defense has a point. Do you have an explanation for this, Mr. Sahwit?"
The first turnabout,1,216,Sahwit,"No, I... I find it quite puzzling myself! Quite! ... Aah! W-wait! I remember now!"
The first turnabout,1,217,Judge,"Mr. Sahwit? The court would prefer to hear an accurate testimony from the very beginning. These constant corrections are harming your credibility. That, and you seem rather... distraught."
The first turnabout,1,218,Sahwit,"...! M-my apologies, Your Honor! It... er, it must have been the shock of finding the body!"
The first turnabout,1,219,Judge,"Very well, Mr. Sahwit. Let's hear your testimony once more please."
The first turnabout,1,220,Sahwit,"Actually, I didn't ""hear"" the time... I ""saw"" it!"
The first turnabout,1,221,Phoenix,That strikes me as a very suspicious mistake.
The first turnabout,1,222,Sahwit,"Yes, I can see how you'd be a little doubtful... I'm really sorry. I only just remembered that table clock!"
The first turnabout,1,223,Judge,"A ""table clock""?"
The first turnabout,1,224,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
The first turnabout,1,225,Phoenix,"A ""table clock""? Was there a clock at the scene?"
The first turnabout,1,226,Judge,This is the first I've heard of it!
The first turnabout,1,227,Sahwit,"Yeah, the murder weapon! The killer used it to hit the victim!"
The first turnabout,1,228,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
The first turnabout,1,229,Phoenix,The... murder weapon?
The first turnabout,1,230,Sahwit,"Yes, the table clock that was used as a weapon! That's what I just said. Did you doze off in the middle of my testimony or something?"
The first turnabout,1,231,Phoenix,(Something's fishy here...)
The first turnabout,1,232,Sahwit,That must have been what I saw.
The first turnabout,1,233,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
The first turnabout,1,234,Phoenix,Why didn't you tell us that in the first place?
The first turnabout,1,235,Sahwit,I guess it just slipped my mind! I'm not really sure how it happened myself...
The first turnabout,1,236,Payne,The witness says he saw the table clock. End of story.
The first turnabout,1,237,Phoenix,Objection.gif
The first turnabout,1,238,Phoenix,Wait just a moment! The murder weapon wasn't a clock. It was this statue! Now how is this supposed to be a clock?
The first turnabout,1,239,Sahwit,"Whaa!? Y-you with your ""objections,"" and your ""evidence""... Just who do you think you are!?"
The first turnabout,1,240,Phoenix,"Just answer the question, Mr. Sahwit."
The first turnabout,1,241,Sahwit,"Hey, I... I saw it there, okay! That's a clock!"
The first turnabout,1,242,Payne,Your Honor! If I may...
The first turnabout,1,243,Judge,"Yes, Mr. Payne?"
The first turnabout,1,244,Payne,"As the witness stated, this statue is indeed a clock. The neck is a switch. You just tilt it, and it says the time out loud. As it doesn't look like a clock, I submitted it as a statue. My apologies."
The first turnabout,1,245,Judge,"I see. So the murder weapon was a table clock after all. Well, Mr. Wright? It appears that the witness's testimony was correct. This is a clock. Do you have any problems with his testimony now?"
The first turnabout,1,246,Phoenix,"Your Honor, there is a gaping hole in the witness's testimony!"
The first turnabout,1,247,Phoenix,"The only way he could have known the weapon was a clock is to hold it in his hand. Yet the witness testified that he never entered the apartment! Clearly, a contradiction!"
The first turnabout,1,248,Judge,Hmm... indeed!
The first turnabout,1,249,Phoenix,"The witness knew it was a clock, because he went into the apartment"
The first turnabout,1,250,Phoenix,You're lying! You were inside the apartment on the day of the murder!
The first turnabout,1,251,Sahwit,Oh yeah? Prove it! Prove I went in there!
The first turnabout,1,252,Phoenix,"I'll do better than that! I can prove you were the one who killed her! You struck her with the clock, and the shock of the blow triggered the clock's voice! That was the sound you heard!"
The first turnabout,1,253,Judge,"Order in the court! Intriguing. Please continue, Mr. Wright."
The first turnabout,1,254,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Sahwit. The sound must have left quite an impression on you. Understandable, since the murder weapon spoke just as you hit the victim! That voice was burned into your mind. That's why you were so certain about the time!"
The first turnabout,1,255,Payne,Objection.gif
The first turnabout,1,256,Payne,W-w-what's the meaning of this? This is all baseless conjecture!
The first turnabout,1,257,Phoenix,Baseless...? Just look at the witness's face!
The first turnabout,1,258,Sahwit,Ngh... grrrah!
The first turnabout,1,259,Judge,Would the witness care to elaborate? Did you strike the victim with the clock?
The first turnabout,1,260,Sahwit,"I... I...! That... that day... I... I never! Look... I... the clock... I heard, no! I mean, I saw...Saw... nggg! Gwaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Shutupshutupshutup! I hate you! I-it was him, I tell you! I saw him! H-he killed her and he should burn! Burn! Give him death!"
The first turnabout,1,261,Judge,Order! Order in the court I say!
The first turnabout,1,262,Payne,"Your Honor, a-a moment please! There isn't a shred of evidence supporting the defense's claims!"
The first turnabout,1,263,Judge,Mr. Wright!
The first turnabout,1,264,Phoenix,Your Honor?
The first turnabout,1,265,Judge,You claim the sound the witness heard came from the clock... Do you have any evidence?
The first turnabout,1,266,Phoenix,"(The whole case is riding on this! I'd better think it through carefully!) Yes, Your Honor. The sound Mr. Sahwit heard was definitely this clock. A fact which is clear if you simply try sounding the clock"
The first turnabout,1,267,Phoenix,"Let's sound the clock now, here in this court. Your Honor, may I have the clock? I ask the court to listen very carefully..."
The first turnabout,1,268,Alarm clock,...*beep*... [I think it's 8:25.]
The first turnabout,1,269,Judge,That certainly is a strange way to announce the time.
The first turnabout,1,270,Phoenix,"Well, he is ""The Thinker,"" after all."
The first turnabout,1,271,Judge,"So, we've heard the clock. What are your conclusions, Mr. Wright?"
The first turnabout,1,272,Phoenix,Mr. Payne... can you tell me what time it is now?
The first turnabout,1,273,Payne,It's 11:25... Ack!
The first turnabout,1,274,Phoenix,"As you can see, this clock is exactly three hours slow! Precisely the discrepancy between what Mr. Sahwit heard and the actual time of death! So, Mr. Sahwit... Try to talk your way out of this one!"
The first turnabout,1,275,Sahwit,... ...Hah! Hah hah! You forgot one thing!
The first turnabout,1,276,Phoenix,(Uh oh... what's he talking about...?)
The first turnabout,1,277,Sahwit,"While it may seem like that clock IS running three hours slow... It proves nothing! How do you know it was running three days slow on the day of the murder!? If you can't prove that, you don't have a case!"
The first turnabout,1,278,Phoenix,...! (He's right! How am I going to prove that!? Dammit! I was so close!)
The first turnabout,1,279,Judge,Mr. Wright? It seems you lack the critical evidence to support your claim.
The first turnabout,1,280,Phoenix,"...! Yes, Your Honor."
The first turnabout,1,281,Judge,This means I cannot let you indict the witness. Unfortunately... This ends the cross-examination of Mr. Frank Sahwit.
The first turnabout,1,282,Sahwit,"I come all the way down here to testify, and look what happens! You treat me like a criminal! A criminal! You lawyers are all slime!"
The first turnabout,1,283,Phoenix,"(Grr! I almost had him! Sorry, Larry... I failed you. There's nothing I can do about it now...)"
The first turnabout,1,284,Mia,"Not so fast, Mr. Sahwit!"
The first turnabout,1,285,Phoenix,"Mia! I mean, Chief!"
The first turnabout,1,286,Mia,"Listen up, Wright! Don't throw this one away, not like this! Think!"
The first turnabout,1,287,Phoenix,"But, Chief, it's over. I can't prove the clock was slow the day of the murder! Nobody can prove that!"
The first turnabout,1,288,Mia,"Um... well, yes. But that doesn't mean you can't still win! Try thinking out of the box! Don't waste time doubting the facts. Assume the clock was three hours slow and... Think through it! Ask yourself, ""Why was the clock three hours slow""? Figure out the reason, and you'll have your proof! Right, Wright? Can you think of a reason as to why the clock would be three hours slow?"
The first turnabout,1,289,Phoenix,... Wait! Maybe I can prove it!
The first turnabout,1,290,Mia,"You must have evidence somewhere that can prove it, Wright! Find it and let them have it!"
The first turnabout,1,291,Judge,"Well, Mr. Wright? You say the clock was already running slow on the day of the murder... Have you found evidence to support this claim?"
The first turnabout,1,292,Phoenix,Of course. There is a piece of evidence in the Court Record that can prove my claim beyond a doubt!
The first turnabout,1,293,Sahwit,Hah! Tough words! Let's see you pull this one off!
The first turnabout,1,294,Judge,Let's see this evidence that proves why the clock was running slow!
The first turnabout,1,295,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
The first turnabout,1,296,Phoenix,"The victim had just returned home from abroad the day before the murder. As we all know, the time difference between here and Paris is nine hours! When it's 4:00 PM here, it's 1:00 AM the next day there. The clock wasn't three hours slow, it was nine hours fast! The victim hadn't reset her clock since returning home! That's why the time you heard when you struck her dead in her apartment was wrong! Proof enough for you, Mr. Sahwit? Or should I say... Mr. Did It!"
The first turnabout,1,297,Sahwit,Ngh! ...!
The first turnabout,1,298,Judge,"O-order! Order, I say!"
The first turnabout,1,299,Judge,Well... This case has certainly turned out differently than we all expected. Mr. Payne... your witness?
The first turnabout,1,300,Payne,"He... er... he was arrested and has been taken away, Your Honor."
The first turnabout,1,301,Judge,Very well. Mr. Wright?
The first turnabout,1,302,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor."
The first turnabout,1,303,Judge,"I have to say, I'm impressed. I don't think I've ever seen someone complete a defense so quickly... and find the true culprit at the same time!"
The first turnabout,1,304,Phoenix,"Thank you, Your Honor."
The first turnabout,1,305,Judge,"At this point, this is only a formality, but... This court finds the defendant, Mr. Larry Butz... Not Guilty"
The first turnabout,1,306,Judge,And with that... The court is adjourned.
The first turnabout,1,307,Phoenix,(Whew... I still can't believe we won!)
The first turnabout,1,308,Mia,Wright! Good job in there! Congratulations!
The first turnabout,1,309,Phoenix,"Th-thanks, Chief. I owe it all to you."
The first turnabout,1,310,Mia,"Not at all, not at all! You fought your own battles in there. It's been a while since I've seen a trial end on such a satisfying note!"
The first turnabout,1,311,Phoenix,"(I've never seen the chief looking this happy... If she's this glad, imagine how Larry must feel!)"
The first turnabout,1,312,Butz,My life is over...
The first turnabout,1,313,Phoenix,Larry! You're supposed to be happy! What's wrong now!?
The first turnabout,1,314,Butz,"Aww, Nick... Don't worry 'bout me! I'll be dead and gone soon!"
The first turnabout,1,315,Phoenix,"Good! Wait, no! I mean... Bad! Bad bad bad! Larry, you're innocent! The case is closed."
The first turnabout,1,316,Butz,"... But... but my Cindy-windy's gone, man! Gone forever!"
The first turnabout,1,317,Phoenix,"(Larry, she was a... Nah... Never mind.)"
The first turnabout,1,318,Mia,"Congratulations, Harry!"
The first turnabout,1,319,Butz,H-Harry...?
The first turnabout,1,320,Mia,"Yes, you! I can practically see the headlines now: ""Harry Butz, Innocent!"""
The first turnabout,1,321,Butz,"Heh... um... thanks! I really owe you one. I won't forget this, ever! Let's celebrate! Dinner? Movie? My treat!"
The first turnabout,1,322,Mia,"Oh, no, I couldn't."
The first turnabout,1,323,Phoenix,"(Hey, I was the one who got you off the hook!)"
The first turnabout,1,324,Butz,"Oh, hey! H-here, take this! It's a present!"
The first turnabout,1,325,Mia,A present? For me? Wait... Wasn't this the evidence that...
The first turnabout,1,326,Butz,"Actually, I made this clock for her! I made one for her and one for me."
The first turnabout,1,327,Mia,"R-really? You? You made this? ... Well, thank you. I'll keep it as a memento."
The first turnabout,1,328,Butz,"Yo, Nick... Can you believe it? I was so into that chick... And... and she was just playing me for a fool! Don't that make you wanna just cry? *sob*"
The first turnabout,1,329,Phoenix,Larry...
The first turnabout,1,330,Mia,... Are you so sure?
The first turnabout,1,331,Butz,Ex-squeeze me?
The first turnabout,1,332,Mia,"I think she thought quite a lot of you, in her own way."
The first turnabout,1,333,Butz,"Nah, you don't gotta sympathize with me, 'sokay."
The first turnabout,1,334,Mia,"Oh, I'm not just sympathizing, really. Isn't that right, Wright? Don't you have something to show your friend? Something that proves how she felt about him?"
The first turnabout,1,335,Phoenix,"H-huh? Oh, yeah, right! (What the heck is she talking about?)"
The first turnabout,1,336,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
The first turnabout,1,337,Phoenix,"Check this out, Larry. Proof Positive you weren't just some chump to her."
The first turnabout,1,338,Butz,Huh...? What about that clock?
The first turnabout,1,339,Phoenix,"This is the clock YOU made for her, Larry! And she took it with her when she traveled."
The first turnabout,1,340,Butz,"Whatever. She probably just needed a clock, that's all."
The first turnabout,1,341,Phoenix,You think so? It's a pretty heavy clock to take traveling.
The first turnabout,1,342,Butz,...
The first turnabout,1,343,Phoenix,"Well, make of it what you will."
The first turnabout,1,344,Butz,"... Hey, Nick. I'm glad I asked you to be my lawyer. Really, I am. Thanks."
The first turnabout,1,345,Phoenix,(Hope that made him feel a little better...)
The first turnabout,1,346,Mia,"Well, I think our work here is done! Shall we be off?"
The first turnabout,1,347,Phoenix,"Yeah, I guess so!"
The first turnabout,1,348,Mia,"Say, how about dinner. On me? We'll drink a toast to innocent Butz!"
The first turnabout,1,349,Phoenix,Yeah!
The first turnabout,1,350,Mia,"Oh, speaking of Harry... You were saying part of why you became a lawyer was because of him."
The first turnabout,1,351,Phoenix,"Er, yeah. Part, at least."
The first turnabout,1,352,Mia,You'll have to tell me more about it sometime! Maybe... over drinks?
Turnabout sisters,1,0,Phoenix,"Uh oh, I'm late. Huh, that's strange. The chief must have gone home already. She said her sister was coming over so we should all go out for dinner... ... What's that smell...? Blood...? Mia! (Maybe she's in her office!)"
Turnabout sisters,1,1,Phoenix,That smell... Blood!
Turnabout sisters,1,2,Maya,... *sob* Sis...
Turnabout sisters,1,3,Phoenix,(Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...?
Turnabout sisters,1,4,Phoenix,Chief!!!
Turnabout sisters,1,5,Phoenix,Who are you?
Turnabout sisters,1,6,Maya,...
Turnabout sisters,1,7,Phoenix,"(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.) Chief..."
Turnabout sisters,1,8,Phoenix,Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart.
Turnabout sisters,1,9,???,"Police!? Please, come quick!"
Turnabout sisters,1,10,Phoenix,(Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand...
Turnabout sisters,1,11,Phoenix,"...! (That girl just now... where'd she go!? I put her right there on that sofa...! Uh oh... I hope she didn't run on me.) Yipes! (Don't scare me like that...) Umm... Excuse me but, who are you?"
Turnabout sisters,1,12,Maya,...
Turnabout sisters,1,13,Phoenix,It's okay. I work here.
Turnabout sisters,1,14,Maya,Maya... Maya Fey.
Turnabout sisters,1,15,Phoenix,Maya... Fey?
Turnabout sisters,1,16,Phoenix,"Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt."
Turnabout sisters,1,17,Maya,! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name?
Turnabout sisters,1,18,Phoenix,"Please, just calm down."
Turnabout sisters,1,19,Maya,W-why would Sis write my name?
Turnabout sisters,1,20,Phoenix,(Uh-oh. Now I've done it...)
Turnabout sisters,1,21,_,*whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*... *whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*...
Turnabout sisters,1,22,Phoenix,! The police! (Sounds like they're coming this way!)
Turnabout sisters,1,23,_,Freeze! Police!
Turnabout sisters,1,24,Gumshoe,"Alright, I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, see?"
Turnabout sisters,1,25,Phoenix,(Gumshoe...? What an odd name.)
Turnabout sisters,1,26,Gumshoe,"We received a report from the building across the way, see. Got a person saying they saw a murder."
Turnabout sisters,1,27,Phoenix,(It must have been that woman I saw.)
Turnabout sisters,1,28,Gumshoe,"Anyway, I don't want either of you moving one inch, 'kay?"
Turnabout sisters,1,29,Phoenix,"(Great. Just great. Maya... Wait, she wouldn't have... nah.)"
Turnabout sisters,1,30,Gumshoe,Whoaaaaaaaaaaaah! Scuze me!
Turnabout sisters,1,31,Maya,Eek!
Turnabout sisters,1,32,Gumshoe,"This word ""Maya"" here mean anything to you?"
Turnabout sisters,1,33,Maya,...! Um... that... That's my name...
Turnabout sisters,1,34,Gumshoe,"WHAAAAT!? The victim drew this here note in her own blood, see? With her dying breath, she wrote down the killer's name!"
Turnabout sisters,1,35,Maya,K-killer...? I'm not--
Turnabout sisters,1,36,Gumshoe,"Case closed! You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am."
Turnabout sisters,1,37,Maya,W-what?
Turnabout sisters,1,38,Phoenix,"(Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.)"
Turnabout sisters,1,39,Maya,Oh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning.
Turnabout sisters,1,40,Phoenix,Good morning! (She looks so tired...)
Turnabout sisters,1,41,Maya,Um... Are you going to be my attorney?
Turnabout sisters,1,42,Phoenix,(I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you.
Turnabout sisters,1,43,Maya,Up... to me?
Turnabout sisters,1,44,Phoenix,"Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here."
Turnabout sisters,1,45,Maya,"... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!"
Turnabout sisters,1,46,Phoenix,"(Did I look at her like that?) No, no! I never thought..."
Turnabout sisters,1,47,Maya,I-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you.
Turnabout sisters,1,48,Phoenix,Heard...? Heard what about me?
Turnabout sisters,1,49,Maya,I... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day...
Turnabout sisters,1,50,Maya,That's what she said!
Turnabout sisters,1,51,Phoenix,...
Turnabout sisters,1,52,Maya,I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you...
Turnabout sisters,1,53,Phoenix,"No, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia..."
Turnabout sisters,1,54,Maya,... I know...
Turnabout sisters,1,55,Phoenix,There's something I've been wanting to ask you...
Turnabout sisters,1,56,Maya,Yes?
Turnabout sisters,1,57,Phoenix,What's with that outfit?
Turnabout sisters,1,58,Maya,"Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say."
Turnabout sisters,1,59,Phoenix,A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do?
Turnabout sisters,1,60,Maya,"Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training."
Turnabout sisters,1,61,Phoenix,A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.)
Turnabout sisters,1,62,Phoenix,Could you tell me about the day of the murder?
Turnabout sisters,1,63,Maya,"Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial."
Turnabout sisters,1,64,Phoenix,Evidence?
Turnabout sisters,1,65,Maya,"Yes. That clock shaped like ""The Thinker."""
Turnabout sisters,1,66,Phoenix,(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?
Turnabout sisters,1,67,Maya,"Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?"
Turnabout sisters,1,68,Phoenix,H-her own voice!?
Turnabout sisters,1,69,Maya,Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.
Turnabout sisters,1,70,Phoenix,You recorded it!
Turnabout sisters,1,71,Maya,Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things.
Turnabout sisters,1,72,Phoenix,"So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!"
Turnabout sisters,1,73,Maya,Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.
Turnabout sisters,1,74,Phoenix,"Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it."
Turnabout sisters,1,75,Maya,"I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?"
Turnabout sisters,1,76,Phoenix,"Sure, thanks."
Turnabout sisters,1,77,Maya,... Um...!
Turnabout sisters,1,78,Phoenix,Huh? Something the matter?
Turnabout sisters,1,79,Maya,"Um... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor?"
Turnabout sisters,1,80,Phoenix,...?
Turnabout sisters,1,81,Maya,"This is the address of a famous lawyer. My sister gave me this a long time ago. She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me?"
Turnabout sisters,1,82,Phoenix,(Hmm...)
Turnabout sisters,1,83,Phoenix,"Sure, why not? I'll go ask."
Turnabout sisters,1,84,Maya,Thank you so much! I have no one else to turn to...
Turnabout sisters,1,85,Phoenix,"...? Say, what about your parents...?"
Turnabout sisters,1,86,Maya,... ... ...
Turnabout sisters,1,87,Phoenix,"I... I see. Don't worry, leave it to me."
Turnabout sisters,1,88,Maya,Thank you! The trial's tomorrow... at 10:00.
Turnabout sisters,1,89,Phoenix,W-what!? Tomorrow!?
Turnabout sisters,1,90,Maya,Tomorrow.
Turnabout sisters,1,91,Phoenix,What if this guy refuses!?
Turnabout sisters,1,92,Maya,"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me."
Turnabout sisters,1,93,Phoenix,(The office is filled with police officers. They're all busily searching for clues...)
Turnabout sisters,1,94,Gumshoe,"Hey! You there! This is a crime scene, pal! No trespassing! Umm... Sorry, don't I know you from somewhere? Wait, you're that Butz guy, aren't you!"
Turnabout sisters,1,95,Phoenix,"No, no, Phoenix Wright. (How could anyone mistake me for Larry!?)"
Turnabout sisters,1,96,Gumshoe,"Ah, guess I got the wrong name, Mr. Wright. Sorry 'bout that. That Butz guy, he was a killer! And you're no killer! Right?"
Turnabout sisters,1,97,Phoenix,(He WAS proven innocent...) Umm... right. And you were...
Turnabout sisters,1,98,Phoenix,"Um... Gumshoe, wasn't it? Dick Gumshoe?"
Turnabout sisters,1,99,Gumshoe,"Right! At your service. Hang on! That's Detective Gumshoe to you, pal!"
Turnabout sisters,1,100,Gumshoe,"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me ""Dick""..."
Turnabout sisters,1,101,Police,"Hey, Dick! Get over here!"
Turnabout sisters,1,102,Gumshoe,"Y-yes, sir! B-be right there! Umm... ahem! You're her lawyer, right, pal? If you got business here, you'd better do it quick!"
Turnabout sisters,1,103,Phoenix,(Whew! He thinks I'm Maya's lawyer...!)
Turnabout sisters,1,104,Phoenix,About Ms. Fey... did you do an autopsy?
Turnabout sisters,1,105,Gumshoe,"Hmm? You want to know the results, eh?"
Turnabout sisters,1,106,Phoenix,...
Turnabout sisters,1,107,Gumshoe,"Now don't you look at me like that, pal! It's no use! She might have been your boss, but that doesn't mean you get any special treatment. Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all!"
Turnabout sisters,1,108,Phoenix,"Um, about Maya..."
Turnabout sisters,1,109,Gumshoe,"Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!"
Turnabout sisters,1,110,Phoenix,W-why do you say that?
Turnabout sisters,1,111,Gumshoe,The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!
Turnabout sisters,1,112,Phoenix,(Edgeworth...)
Turnabout sisters,1,113,Gumshoe,"I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all."
Turnabout sisters,1,114,Phoenix,I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?
Turnabout sisters,1,115,Gumshoe,Oh that? I have that.
Turnabout sisters,1,116,Phoenix,Do you think you could give it back?
Turnabout sisters,1,117,Gumshoe,"Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!"
Turnabout sisters,1,118,Phoenix,"(Uh-oh, he's on to me!)"
Turnabout sisters,1,119,Phoenix,"(Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?)"
Turnabout sisters,1,120,Gumshoe,Something the matter?
Turnabout sisters,1,121,Phoenix,"Oh, no, um... T-that carrying strap on the cell phone..."
Turnabout sisters,1,122,Gumshoe,"This? Hmm... it says ""The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo""... ""The Steel Samurai""... that action hero on TV?"
Turnabout sisters,1,123,Phoenix,"Yeah, you see that strap is a collector's item... She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct."
Turnabout sisters,1,124,Gumshoe,That what she said?
Turnabout sisters,1,125,Phoenix,Um. Yes.
Turnabout sisters,1,126,Gumshoe,"... Okay, pal. I wrote down all the numbers she called anyway. Here you go."
Turnabout sisters,1,127,Phoenix,(Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...)
Turnabout sisters,1,128,Phoenix,(I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.)
Turnabout sisters,1,129,Gumshoe,"You all done, pal?"
Turnabout sisters,1,130,Phoenix,"Um, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now."
Turnabout sisters,1,131,Gumshoe,"Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!"
Turnabout sisters,1,132,Phoenix,"... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?"
Turnabout sisters,1,133,Gumshoe,"Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!"
Turnabout sisters,1,134,Phoenix,"(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?"
Turnabout sisters,1,135,Gumshoe,Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!
Turnabout sisters,1,136,Phoenix,(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.
Turnabout sisters,1,137,Gumshoe,"You got that right, pal!"
Turnabout sisters,1,138,Phoenix,(Time to pay a visit to Miss May!)
Turnabout sisters,1,139,April,"Well! Hello there, handsome."
Turnabout sisters,1,140,Phoenix,"Umm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.)"
Turnabout sisters,1,141,April,"You're the lawyer, aren't you? The detective told me... He said, ""Don't say nothing to that lawyer, pal!"" Tee hee!"
Turnabout sisters,1,142,Phoenix,(Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.)
Turnabout sisters,1,143,April,Gee! This is all like something out of a movie! It's all so exciting I can hardly contain myself! Ooh! Let me go freshen up so I can look the part of the beautiful eyewitness!
Turnabout sisters,1,144,Phoenix,(I pity the lawyer that has to cross-examine this one.)
Turnabout sisters,1,145,Phoenix,(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)
Turnabout sisters,1,146,April,"Hey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you?"
Turnabout sisters,1,147,Phoenix,(Upset!? I thought she was going to explode for a second there! I wonder what could be inside the drawer?)
Turnabout sisters,1,148,Phoenix,"(Hmm... seems like Mr. Grossberg is out. Well, maybe I should just wait here for him to come back.)"
Turnabout sisters,1,149,Grossberg,*Ah-HHHHEM!*
Turnabout sisters,1,150,Phoenix,(If that wasn't the most over-the-top clearing of the throat I've ever heard!)
Turnabout sisters,1,151,Grossberg,"Ah hah! So, you're the one they say has been looking for me?"
Turnabout sisters,1,152,Phoenix,"Uh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!)"
Turnabout sisters,1,153,Grossberg,"Hmm...? That badge on your collar...? Ah, so you're a lawyer, are you now?"
Turnabout sisters,1,154,Phoenix,"Y-yes, well... yes."
Turnabout sisters,1,155,Grossberg,"And what do you want? I'm not particularly busy these days... Please, proceed!"
Turnabout sisters,1,156,Phoenix,(Not busy...? Then how come no one could get in touch with you?)
Turnabout sisters,1,157,Grossberg,"Hmm? Something the matter? You came to see the one-and-only Marvin Grossberg, did you not? Well, here I am, boy! What do you want? Out with it!"
Turnabout sisters,1,158,Phoenix,"Um... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey."
Turnabout sisters,1,159,Grossberg,...! Ah... yes. Maya Fey. Go on.
Turnabout sisters,1,160,Phoenix,(Hmm? Why the strange reaction?)
Turnabout sisters,1,161,Grossberg,"A-cha-cha. I'm really quite busy here, son. I can't go taking cases on a day's notice! No, it's quite impossible."
Turnabout sisters,1,162,Phoenix,W-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!?
Turnabout sisters,1,163,Grossberg,Urk? Ahem! A-anyway... I'm afraid it's entirely impossible for me to represent her. Sorry. End of discussion.
Turnabout sisters,1,164,Phoenix,(What's going on!? He refused me before I even got a chance to ask him! What do I tell Maya...?)
Turnabout sisters,1,165,Phoenix,"How can you just refuse like that! Please, tell me why you won't take the case!"
Turnabout sisters,1,166,Grossberg,"Hmm? Eh, ahem! Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see!"
Turnabout sisters,1,167,Phoenix,But the client is Mia Fey's sister!
Turnabout sisters,1,168,Grossberg,Hmm... ahem.
Turnabout sisters,1,169,Phoenix,Mia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands.
Turnabout sisters,1,170,Grossberg,"Yes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye."
Turnabout sisters,1,171,Phoenix,Creep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere.
Turnabout sisters,1,172,Grossberg,*grumble*... Think not.
Turnabout sisters,1,173,Phoenix,Huh? Did you say something?
Turnabout sisters,1,174,Grossberg,"I think not, I said."
Turnabout sisters,1,175,Phoenix,Wh-what do you mean?
Turnabout sisters,1,176,Grossberg,"I'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy."
Turnabout sisters,1,177,Phoenix,Why!?
Turnabout sisters,1,178,Grossberg,"I... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you."
Turnabout sisters,1,179,Phoenix,(What's going on here!?)
Turnabout sisters,1,180,Phoenix,How did you know Mia Fey...?
Turnabout sisters,1,181,Grossberg,"... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see."
Turnabout sisters,1,182,Phoenix,"A ""mission""?"
Turnabout sisters,1,183,Grossberg,"You could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one."
Turnabout sisters,1,184,Phoenix,That's... quite a painting.
Turnabout sisters,1,185,Grossberg,"Ahah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you!"
Turnabout sisters,1,186,Phoenix,(I wasn't interested...)
Turnabout sisters,1,187,Grossberg,It's not for sale!
Turnabout sisters,1,188,Phoenix,I'm not buying! (Geez!)
Turnabout sisters,1,189,Phoenix,Hiya.
Turnabout sisters,1,190,Maya,Oh! You're back! Did you find the lawyer?
Turnabout sisters,1,191,Phoenix,"Um... well... (What do I tell her?) Well, see... (Just be honest!) I... I really don't think you should use that guy. He... didn't seem healthy. He was all skin and bones!"
Turnabout sisters,1,192,Maya,... What really happened?
Turnabout sisters,1,193,Phoenix,...
Turnabout sisters,1,194,Maya,You don't mean... He refused to help?
Turnabout sisters,1,195,Phoenix,Urp.
Turnabout sisters,1,196,Maya,"... I see. I've been abandoned, then."
Turnabout sisters,1,197,Phoenix,"So, who was this man who, um, ""ruined"" your mother?"
Turnabout sisters,1,198,Maya,"About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate..."
Turnabout sisters,1,199,Phoenix,"Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?"
Turnabout sisters,1,200,Maya,The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.
Turnabout sisters,1,201,Phoenix,"Wow... So, what happened?"
Turnabout sisters,1,202,Maya,The case was solved... we thought.
Turnabout sisters,1,203,Phoenix,"You ""thought""...?"
Turnabout sisters,1,204,Maya,The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.
Turnabout sisters,1,205,Phoenix,...!
Turnabout sisters,1,206,Maya,"The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation."
Turnabout sisters,1,207,Phoenix,I see.
Turnabout sisters,1,208,Maya,... White...
Turnabout sisters,1,209,Phoenix,Excuse me? White?
Turnabout sisters,1,210,Maya,That was his name. My sister told me.
Turnabout sisters,1,211,Phoenix,White? Hmm...
Turnabout sisters,1,212,Maya,"Just a little longer now before the state-appointed lawyer comes, I guess..."
Turnabout sisters,1,213,Phoenix,... (4:00 PM. Time's up. What should I do? Do I just leave her and go home...?)
Turnabout sisters,1,214,Phoenix,I've made up my mind! I'm going to defend you whether you want me to or not!
Turnabout sisters,1,215,Maya,! Why?
Turnabout sisters,1,216,Phoenix,Why? Well...
Turnabout sisters,1,217,Phoenix,... (No one is as sad as a person without any friends. I know... I've been there. A long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) Maya...
Turnabout sisters,1,218,Phoenix,I won't abandon you. You can count on me.
Turnabout sisters,1,219,Maya,... That's so kind of you... *sniff*... ...
Turnabout sisters,1,220,Phoenix,Well! Let's fight this one and get you out of here!
Turnabout sisters,1,221,Maya,R-right! Thank you!
Turnabout sisters,1,222,Phoenix,"(Whew, she smiled at last. She looks like an entirely different person!) One last question... You are innocent, right?"
Turnabout sisters,1,223,Maya,"Yes! And I trust you... So you trust me, too, okay?"
Turnabout sisters,1,224,Phoenix,"It's a deal. (So, what next... There's something that's been bugging me... Just what was inside that strange woman's drawer? It was when I tried to look into the drawer that she got all defensive. There has to be something in there!)"
Turnabout sisters,1,225,Bellboy,"Good afternoon, sir!"
Turnabout sisters,1,226,Phoenix,"Excuse me, you are...?"
Turnabout sisters,1,227,Bellboy,"Ah, I beg your pardon, sir! I am the bellboy of this establishment, at your service, sir."
Turnabout sisters,1,228,Phoenix,"Oh, right."
Turnabout sisters,1,229,Bellboy,"I've just come up to deliver room service, sir."
Turnabout sisters,1,230,Phoenix,Um... do you know where Miss May might be?
Turnabout sisters,1,231,Bellboy,"Ah. I believe our guest Miss May is currently using the, er, facilities...? If you've no need of anything, I'll be taking my leave. Please, stay as long as you like. Enjoy..."
Turnabout sisters,1,232,Phoenix,"Yeah... Wait... no! Hey! ... (Why does it seem like every time I come here, I end up embarrassing myself? Wait... now's my chance to snoop around a bit!)"
Turnabout sisters,1,233,Bellboy,"Ah, I almost forgot!"
Turnabout sisters,1,234,Phoenix,Gah! Y-you came back quick!
Turnabout sisters,1,235,Bellboy,"Might I ask you to inform Miss May that there is a message for her? Please tell her that Mr. White, of Bluecorp phoned."
Turnabout sisters,1,236,Phoenix,"Oh, right. Sure. (Mr. White... of Bluecorp? Where have I heard that name?)"
Turnabout sisters,1,237,Maya,White... That was his name. My sister told me.
Turnabout sisters,1,238,Phoenix,"(""White"" was the name of the guy who ruined Mia and Maya's mother! Could it be a coincidence?)"
Turnabout sisters,1,239,Phoenix,There's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer. Now's my chance to see what's inside! ...! What do we have here! A... wiretap? Hmm! What would a woman like her be doing with a thing like this?
Turnabout sisters,1,240,Phoenix,"There is definitely something suspicious about this ""Miss May""! Why would she have something like this in her hotel room? There's a story behind all this, I know it! Alright... I'll be using this bit of evidence in tomorrow's trial, that's for sure. For Maya's sake... I'll get to this woman's bottom! Wait... I mean ... you know what I mean."
Turnabout sisters,1,241,April,"Oh, bellboy...? Still there?"
Turnabout sisters,1,242,Phoenix,"(Uh oh, time to scram! I look forward to tangoing with you tomorrow, Miss May! In court!)"
Turnabout sisters,2,0,Judge,The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.
Turnabout sisters,2,1,Edgeworth,"The prosecution is ready, Your Honor."
Turnabout sisters,2,2,Phoenix,"The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)"
Turnabout sisters,2,3,Judge,Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.
Turnabout sisters,2,4,Edgeworth,"Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor."
Turnabout sisters,2,5,Judge,"I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then."
Turnabout sisters,2,6,Edgeworth,"You may call your first witness. The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!"
Turnabout sisters,2,7,Edgeworth,"Witness, please state your name and profession to the court."
Turnabout sisters,2,8,Gumshoe,"Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!"
Turnabout sisters,2,9,Edgeworth,"Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder."
Turnabout sisters,2,10,Gumshoe,"Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here."
Turnabout sisters,2,11,Edgeworth,And the cause of death?
Turnabout sisters,2,12,Gumshoe,"Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of ""The Thinker"" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!"
Turnabout sisters,2,13,Judge,The court accepts the statue as evidence.
Turnabout sisters,2,14,Phoenix,"(They're still calling it a ""statue""...)"
Turnabout sisters,2,15,Edgeworth,"Now, Detective..."
Turnabout sisters,2,16,Gumshoe,Y-yes sir!
Turnabout sisters,2,17,Edgeworth,"You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?"
Turnabout sisters,2,18,Gumshoe,"Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!"
Turnabout sisters,2,19,Judge,"Hmm. Detective Gumshoe, Please testify to the court about this ""hard evidence."""
Turnabout sisters,2,20,Judge,"Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination."
Turnabout sisters,2,21,Phoenix,"Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)"
Turnabout sisters,2,22,_,...whoosh... SMACK!
Turnabout sisters,2,23,Phoenix,"(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? ""When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!"" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)"
Turnabout sisters,2,24,Judge,Something the matter?
Turnabout sisters,2,25,Phoenix,"No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination."
Turnabout sisters,2,26,Gumshoe,"As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!"
Turnabout sisters,2,27,Phoenix,Who did you say you got a call from?
Turnabout sisters,2,28,Gumshoe,"Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!"
Turnabout sisters,2,29,Phoenix,"(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue."
Turnabout sisters,2,30,Gumshoe,There were two people there already:
Turnabout sisters,2,31,Phoenix,"Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?"
Turnabout sisters,2,32,Gumshoe,"Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!"
Turnabout sisters,2,33,Phoenix,Th-that's pretty fast!
Turnabout sisters,2,34,Gumshoe,"Our motto this month is ""quick response""! That's how I got there before the killer got away!"
Turnabout sisters,2,35,Edgeworth,"Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were."
Turnabout sisters,2,36,Gumshoe,Yes sir!
Turnabout sisters,2,37,Gumshoe,"The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright."
Turnabout sisters,2,38,Phoenix,Are you absolutely sure it was us?
Turnabout sisters,2,39,Gumshoe,"Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!"
Turnabout sisters,2,40,Phoenix,(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)
Turnabout sisters,2,41,Gumshoe,I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Turnabout sisters,2,42,Phoenix,Why's that? What's your reason?
Turnabout sisters,2,43,Gumshoe,Why? We had a witness account describing her!
Turnabout sisters,2,44,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,45,Phoenix,Hold on just one second!
Turnabout sisters,2,46,Gumshoe,Y-yeah?
Turnabout sisters,2,47,Phoenix,"If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had ""hard evidence"" she did it, correct?"
Turnabout sisters,2,48,Gumshoe,Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?
Turnabout sisters,2,49,Phoenix,I heard you say it!
Turnabout sisters,2,50,Judge,You did say it.
Turnabout sisters,2,51,Edgeworth,You said it.
Turnabout sisters,2,52,Phoenix,"Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was ""hard evidence""!?"
Turnabout sisters,2,53,Gumshoe,"Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink..."
Turnabout sisters,2,54,Judge,"That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?"
Turnabout sisters,2,55,Gumshoe,Umm...
Turnabout sisters,2,56,Phoenix,(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)
Turnabout sisters,2,57,Gumshoe,... Yes.
Turnabout sisters,2,58,Phoenix,(Gah!)
Turnabout sisters,2,59,Gumshoe,"Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!"
Turnabout sisters,2,60,Judge,"Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again."
Turnabout sisters,2,61,Judge,"Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective."
Turnabout sisters,2,62,Gumshoe,Y-Your Honor?
Turnabout sisters,2,63,Judge,Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?
Turnabout sisters,2,64,Gumshoe,"Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir."
Turnabout sisters,2,65,Judge,"Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination."
Turnabout sisters,2,66,Gumshoe,"After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes."
Turnabout sisters,2,67,Phoenix,And did you find any evidence?
Turnabout sisters,2,68,Gumshoe,"Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!"
Turnabout sisters,2,69,Phoenix,(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Turnabout sisters,2,70,Gumshoe,I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
Turnabout sisters,2,71,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,72,Phoenix,Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!
Turnabout sisters,2,73,Gumshoe,"Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?"
Turnabout sisters,2,74,Phoenix,Wh-who? Um...
Turnabout sisters,2,75,Phoenix,Th-the killer! Anyone can see that!
Turnabout sisters,2,76,Gumshoe,"Hoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!"
Turnabout sisters,2,77,Phoenix,She was framed!
Turnabout sisters,2,78,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,79,Edgeworth,"Hold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence?"
Turnabout sisters,2,80,Phoenix,Ah... (Urk!)
Turnabout sisters,2,81,Edgeworth,"Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright."
Turnabout sisters,2,82,Gumshoe,"Yeah, pal!"
Turnabout sisters,2,83,Phoenix,(Argh...!)
Turnabout sisters,2,84,Edgeworth,"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."
Turnabout sisters,2,85,Gumshoe,"On it, the word ""Maya"" was written clearly in blood!"
Turnabout sisters,2,86,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,87,Phoenix,Do you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!?
Turnabout sisters,2,88,Gumshoe,"Of course I do, pal!"
Turnabout sisters,2,89,Phoenix,(Uh oh... he sounded pretty confident. This might not be good...)
Turnabout sisters,2,90,Gumshoe,Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
Turnabout sisters,2,91,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,92,Phoenix,"What kind of ""tests"" were these again?"
Turnabout sisters,2,93,Gumshoe,"Huh? What kind? Umm... well... I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl... Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin... I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests!"
Turnabout sisters,2,94,Judge,"Yes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony."
Turnabout sisters,2,95,Gumshoe,"Th-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir."
Turnabout sisters,2,96,Edgeworth,Detective Gumshoe.
Turnabout sisters,2,97,Gumshoe,Y-yeah?
Turnabout sisters,2,98,Edgeworth,I think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check.
Turnabout sisters,2,99,Gumshoe,Oh? Oh hoh hoh.
Turnabout sisters,2,100,Phoenix,(That was a mess...)
Turnabout sisters,2,101,Gumshoe,Right! Where was I?
Turnabout sisters,2,102,Gumshoe,"Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!"
Turnabout sisters,2,103,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,104,Phoenix,"On which hand was the bloody finger, Detective?"
Turnabout sisters,2,105,Gumshoe,The right hand!
Turnabout sisters,2,106,Phoenix,(Hmm... she WAS right handed...)
Turnabout sisters,2,107,Gumshoe,Hah hah hah! Nice try!
Turnabout sisters,2,108,Phoenix,(Uh oh... I guess it wasn't too hard to see what I was getting at there.)
Turnabout sisters,2,109,Gumshoe,"Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!"
Turnabout sisters,2,110,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,111,Phoenix,Detective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name?
Turnabout sisters,2,112,Gumshoe,Sure! It happens all the time in books and the movies!
Turnabout sisters,2,113,Phoenix,"This isn't a movie, Detective."
Turnabout sisters,2,114,Gumshoe,Oof!
Turnabout sisters,2,115,Phoenix,"Let's talk about reality, shall we?"
Turnabout sisters,2,116,Gumshoe,"Umm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no."
Turnabout sisters,2,117,Phoenix,Don't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?
Turnabout sisters,2,118,Gumshoe,"Ah, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal."
Turnabout sisters,2,119,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,120,Edgeworth,Stop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!
Turnabout sisters,2,121,Judge,Order! Order!
Turnabout sisters,2,122,Phoenix,(That didn't go so well...)
Turnabout sisters,2,123,Gumshoe,Th-that's right! What he said!
Turnabout sisters,2,124,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,125,Phoenix,"Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?"
Turnabout sisters,2,126,Gumshoe,"Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?"
Turnabout sisters,2,127,Phoenix,"You have it backwards, Detective."
Turnabout sisters,2,128,Gumshoe,B-backwards?
Turnabout sisters,2,129,Phoenix,"The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. ""Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object."" She died immediately!"
Turnabout sisters,2,130,Gumshoe,But...!
Turnabout sisters,2,131,Phoenix,"No ""but""-ing your way out of this one, Detective!"
Turnabout sisters,2,132,Judge,Order! Order! The defense has a point.
Turnabout sisters,2,133,Judge,Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.
Turnabout sisters,2,134,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,135,Edgeworth,"Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?"
Turnabout sisters,2,136,Phoenix,Wh-when...!?
Turnabout sisters,2,137,Phoenix,It was the day after the murder...
Turnabout sisters,2,138,Judge,The prosecution's point being...?
Turnabout sisters,2,139,Edgeworth,"That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor."
Turnabout sisters,2,140,Phoenix,Wh-what!?
Turnabout sisters,2,141,Edgeworth,"A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! ""Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow."" I received these results this morning."
Turnabout sisters,2,142,Phoenix,N-no way!
Turnabout sisters,2,143,Edgeworth,"Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write ""Maya""! That is all."
Turnabout sisters,2,144,Judge,I see!
Turnabout sisters,2,145,Phoenix,"(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)"
Turnabout sisters,2,146,Edgeworth,"Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?"
Turnabout sisters,2,147,Phoenix,Mr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report?
Turnabout sisters,2,148,Judge,Mr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution!
Turnabout sisters,2,149,Edgeworth,"No matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable."
Turnabout sisters,2,150,Edgeworth,"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."
Turnabout sisters,2,151,Judge,U-understood. The court accepts the evidence.
Turnabout sisters,2,152,Edgeworth,"Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer."
Turnabout sisters,2,153,Judge,"I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes."
Turnabout sisters,2,154,Phoenix,(Darn! This isn't good!)
Turnabout sisters,2,155,Edgeworth,"The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!"
Turnabout sisters,2,156,Judge,Let the witness Miss April May take the stand.
Turnabout sisters,2,157,Phoenix,"(Exactly what part of her is ""innocent""...?)"
Turnabout sisters,2,158,Edgeworth,"Witness, your name, please."
Turnabout sisters,2,159,April,April May! At your service! *wink*
Turnabout sisters,2,160,Judge,Order! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wonton * winking!
Turnabout sisters,2,161,April,"Aww... Yes, Your Honor."
Turnabout sisters,2,162,Phoenix,(This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)
Turnabout sisters,2,163,Edgeworth,"Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?"
Turnabout sisters,2,164,April,"Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch."
Turnabout sisters,2,165,Edgeworth,And this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?
Turnabout sisters,2,166,April,"Mmm... that's right, big boy."
Turnabout sisters,2,167,Judge,Please testify to the court about what you saw.
Turnabout sisters,2,168,Edgeworth,"Well, Your Honor?"
Turnabout sisters,2,169,Judge,I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...
Turnabout sisters,2,170,Phoenix,"W-wait, Your Honor!"
Turnabout sisters,2,171,Judge,"Yes, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout sisters,2,172,Phoenix,What about my cross-examination!?
Turnabout sisters,2,173,Judge,I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?
Turnabout sisters,2,174,Edgeworth,"Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies..."
Turnabout sisters,2,175,Phoenix,H-hey! How dare you!
Turnabout sisters,2,176,Judge,"Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?"
Turnabout sisters,2,177,Phoenix,I'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!)
Turnabout sisters,2,178,Judge,"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!"
Turnabout sisters,2,179,April,"It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!"
Turnabout sisters,2,180,Phoenix,Why did you do that?
Turnabout sisters,2,181,April,"Huh? ""Why""? Like, why what?"
Turnabout sisters,2,182,Phoenix,Why did you look out the window? Were you expecting to see something?
Turnabout sisters,2,183,April,"Oh, well, um... gee!"
Turnabout sisters,2,184,Phoenix,(What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!)
Turnabout sisters,2,185,April,"I sort of, y'know. I had a feeling!"
Turnabout sisters,2,186,Phoenix,"(Well, I have a feeling she's trying to avoid the question! Maybe I should press a little harder on this one?)"
Turnabout sisters,2,187,Phoenix,"(If I go too deep, I might not come back out alive... I'll back off for now.)"
Turnabout sisters,2,188,Edgeworth,You looked out the window. What did you see next?
Turnabout sisters,2,189,April,"And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!"
Turnabout sisters,2,190,Phoenix,The woman with long hair... that was Mia Fey?
Turnabout sisters,2,191,April,"Um-hmm! Slender, sort of, well, some people might say pretty, if that's your thing."
Turnabout sisters,2,192,Phoenix,(Your... thing?)
Turnabout sisters,2,193,Edgeworth,And the person attacking her?
Turnabout sisters,2,194,April,The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!
Turnabout sisters,2,195,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,196,Phoenix,How do you know she was the defendant?
Turnabout sisters,2,197,April,"Huh? Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay?"
Turnabout sisters,2,198,Edgeworth,"There was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor."
Turnabout sisters,2,199,Phoenix,(He's right...)
Turnabout sisters,2,200,Phoenix,(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one.)
Turnabout sisters,2,201,Edgeworth,"So then, tell us what happened to the victim."
Turnabout sisters,2,202,April,"Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!"
Turnabout sisters,2,203,Phoenix,"She ""dodged""? Dodged what!?"
Turnabout sisters,2,204,April,Well... the attack!
Turnabout sisters,2,205,Edgeworth,"Please, continue your testimony."
Turnabout sisters,2,206,April,"But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!"
Turnabout sisters,2,207,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,208,Phoenix,How did you know it was my client!?
Turnabout sisters,2,209,April,"Huh? Well, I... gee! First of all, she had a girl's physique! And, and secondly, she was... she was small! Who else could it be but her!"
Turnabout sisters,2,210,Phoenix,(She has a point...)
Turnabout sisters,2,211,Phoenix,Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!
Turnabout sisters,2,212,April,W-what!?
Turnabout sisters,2,213,Phoenix,"Miss May, I'm willing to bet that you saw nothing"
Turnabout sisters,2,214,Phoenix,Did you really see the defendant at all!?
Turnabout sisters,2,215,April,Urp!
Turnabout sisters,2,216,Judge,Mr. Wright! What's the meaning of this?
Turnabout sisters,2,217,April,"Yes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean!"
Turnabout sisters,2,218,Phoenix,"Okay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!"
Turnabout sisters,2,219,April,...!
Turnabout sisters,2,220,Phoenix,"No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!"
Turnabout sisters,2,221,April,But... but!
Turnabout sisters,2,222,Judge,"Still, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder..."
Turnabout sisters,2,223,Phoenix,"She was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?"
Turnabout sisters,2,224,April,"Rowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling."
Turnabout sisters,2,225,Judge,Miss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony.
Turnabout sisters,2,226,April,"I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink*"
Turnabout sisters,2,227,Judge,"Your testimony again, if you would."
Turnabout sisters,2,228,Phoenix,"(Damn, I almost had her!)"
Turnabout sisters,2,229,Judge,I... see. I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning. Please begin the cross-examination.
Turnabout sisters,2,230,April,I did see everything! I did!
Turnabout sisters,2,231,Phoenix,"So, you saw me then, too?"
Turnabout sisters,2,232,April,Of course! I'd remember that spiky hair anywhere!
Turnabout sisters,2,233,Phoenix,(Spiky...?)
Turnabout sisters,2,234,Judge,The witness will refrain from personal attacks on the defense attorney.
Turnabout sisters,2,235,April,"Aww, was I a bad girl? I'm sowwy."
Turnabout sisters,2,236,Judge,Very well... continue.
Turnabout sisters,2,237,April,The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.
Turnabout sisters,2,238,Phoenix,"Is that ""right"" as in your right, as you looked from the hotel?"
Turnabout sisters,2,239,April,Um... which hand do I hold my knife in again...? Right! It was my right hand! Right?
Turnabout sisters,2,240,Edgeworth,"Satisfied, Mr. Wright? Please continue."
Turnabout sisters,2,241,April,Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...
Turnabout sisters,2,242,Phoenix,"How convenient for you to remember her ""hippie"" clothes!"
Turnabout sisters,2,243,April,"That's what you--I mean, that's what she was wearing! Oh, and her hair was all done up like a bun!"
Turnabout sisters,2,244,Phoenix,(*sigh*...)
Turnabout sisters,2,245,Judge,What happened then?
Turnabout sisters,2,246,April,And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!
Turnabout sisters,2,247,Phoenix,Where did this weapon come from?
Turnabout sisters,2,248,April,She picked it up from the desk!
Turnabout sisters,2,249,Judge,I see. What sort of weapon was it?
Turnabout sisters,2,250,April,"That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? ""The Thinker,"" I think?"
Turnabout sisters,2,251,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,252,Phoenix,A... clock? (Didn't this come up in another testimony recently...?)
Turnabout sisters,2,253,April,"W-well? Don't look so sour, Mr. Lawyer. You can't win them all."
Turnabout sisters,2,254,Phoenix,(No... but I have a feeling I'm on to something now!)
Turnabout sisters,2,255,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,256,Phoenix,Miss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing.
Turnabout sisters,2,257,April,"Revealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer..."
Turnabout sisters,2,258,Phoenix,"You just said that this statue of ""The Thinker"" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!"
Turnabout sisters,2,259,April,Urp!
Turnabout sisters,2,260,Phoenix,"Another person in much the same position as you recently called this a ""clock,"" too... And he was found guilty... of murder!"
Turnabout sisters,2,261,Judge,Order! Order!
Turnabout sisters,2,262,Phoenix,Miss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?
Turnabout sisters,2,263,April,Oooh... urp!
Turnabout sisters,2,264,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,265,Edgeworth,The witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!
Turnabout sisters,2,266,Judge,"Yes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright."
Turnabout sisters,2,267,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,268,Phoenix,"But questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...)"
Turnabout sisters,2,269,Judge,... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.
Turnabout sisters,2,270,Phoenix,"(Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)"
Turnabout sisters,2,271,April,Huh? What? So... what happens now?
Turnabout sisters,2,272,Phoenix,What happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?
Turnabout sisters,2,273,April,What...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time!
Turnabout sisters,2,274,Phoenix,"So, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.!"
Turnabout sisters,2,275,April,"N-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee!"
Turnabout sisters,2,276,Edgeworth,"The law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!"
Turnabout sisters,2,277,Judge,"Hmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied?"
Turnabout sisters,2,278,Phoenix,"No, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because it couldn't have rung"
Turnabout sisters,2,279,Phoenix,"Your Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang!"
Turnabout sisters,2,280,Phoenix,That clock is missing its clockwork!
Turnabout sisters,2,281,Judge,H-how could you possibly...?
Turnabout sisters,2,282,Phoenix,Just have a look... As soon as you can!
Turnabout sisters,2,283,Judge,... Oh!
Turnabout sisters,2,284,Phoenix,"See anything interesting, Your Honor?"
Turnabout sisters,2,285,Judge,It is as the defense says!
Turnabout sisters,2,286,Judge,This clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this?
Turnabout sisters,2,287,Phoenix,"It is as you can see. The ""clock"" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar!"
Turnabout sisters,2,288,April,F-fat!?
Turnabout sisters,2,289,Phoenix,"Well, Miss May?"
Turnabout sisters,2,290,Edgeworth,Tsk tsk.
Turnabout sisters,2,291,Phoenix,?
Turnabout sisters,2,292,Edgeworth,"Quite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright."
Turnabout sisters,2,293,Phoenix,(He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!)
Turnabout sisters,2,294,Edgeworth,"I'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!"
Turnabout sisters,2,295,Judge,! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.
Turnabout sisters,2,296,Edgeworth,"And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!"
Turnabout sisters,2,297,Judge,"Well, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?"
Turnabout sisters,2,298,Edgeworth,"Ho hoh! Impossible, of course..."
Turnabout sisters,2,299,Phoenix,I have proof.
Turnabout sisters,2,300,Edgeworth,W-what!?
Turnabout sisters,2,301,Phoenix,"Wasn't it you who told me ""proof is everything""? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the ""proof"" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is..."
Turnabout sisters,2,302,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,303,Phoenix,Take a look at this!
Turnabout sisters,2,304,Judge,Hmm. That's a very cute cell phone.
Turnabout sisters,2,305,April,Ooh hoo! You have a girlie phone!
Turnabout sisters,2,306,Phoenix,"W-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!"
Turnabout sisters,2,307,Judge,Order! Order!
Turnabout sisters,2,308,Edgeworth,The defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!
Turnabout sisters,2,309,Phoenix,Perhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?
Turnabout sisters,2,310,Edgeworth,*grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...)
Turnabout sisters,2,311,Phoenix,"(My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.) Let's hear the conversation."
Turnabout sisters,2,312,Cellular,*beep*...
Turnabout sisters,2,313,Maya,"[So you just want me to hold on to ""The Thinker"" for you, then?]"
Turnabout sisters,2,314,Mia,"[If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.]"
Turnabout sisters,2,315,Maya,[Huh? It's not working? That's lame!]
Turnabout sisters,2,316,Mia,"[I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.]"
Turnabout sisters,2,317,Cellular,*beep*
Turnabout sisters,2,318,Phoenix,"Your Honor, I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone... and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!"
Turnabout sisters,2,319,April,Muh... muh... muh!?
Turnabout sisters,2,320,Phoenix,"Well, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?"
Turnabout sisters,2,321,April,"... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink*"
Turnabout sisters,2,322,Judge,"So the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout sisters,2,323,Phoenix,Yes
Turnabout sisters,2,324,Phoenix,"The witness claims she had ""seen it before."" But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!"
Turnabout sisters,2,325,Judge,"Well then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before."
Turnabout sisters,2,326,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,327,Phoenix,"It's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!"
Turnabout sisters,2,328,April,W-whaaat!?
Turnabout sisters,2,329,Phoenix,A friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!
Turnabout sisters,2,330,April,I-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!
Turnabout sisters,2,331,Phoenix,"Miss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?"
Turnabout sisters,2,332,April,Mmpf...
Turnabout sisters,2,333,Phoenix,Oh? Excuses not on sale today?
Turnabout sisters,2,334,April,"Oooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die!"
Turnabout sisters,2,335,Judge,"W-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!"
Turnabout sisters,2,336,April,"Hrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink*"
Turnabout sisters,2,337,Phoenix,(S-scary...)
Turnabout sisters,2,338,Judge,"Miss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?"
Turnabout sisters,2,339,April,...
Turnabout sisters,2,340,Judge,Hmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?
Turnabout sisters,2,341,Phoenix,"(Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because..."
Turnabout sisters,2,342,Phoenix,"The witness had never held the clock in her hand! However, she had heard that it was a clock!"
Turnabout sisters,2,343,Judge,"She ""heard""...?"
Turnabout sisters,2,344,Phoenix,"That is correct, Your Honor. There is no other way she could have known ""The Thinker"" was a clock! And I can show you the proof!"
Turnabout sisters,2,345,Judge,"Well, this is interesting. Let's see it, then. Show me evidence proving that the witness had ""heard"" the murder weapon was a clock."
Turnabout sisters,2,346,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,347,Phoenix,Have a look at this.
Turnabout sisters,2,348,April,Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...
Turnabout sisters,2,349,Phoenix,I found this in Miss May's room.
Turnabout sisters,2,350,Judge,Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!
Turnabout sisters,2,351,Phoenix,"Miss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not?"
Turnabout sisters,2,352,April,Oooh. Oooooh!
Turnabout sisters,2,353,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,354,Edgeworth,"Your Honor, This is irrelevant!"
Turnabout sisters,2,355,Judge,I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.
Turnabout sisters,2,356,Edgeworth,This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?
Turnabout sisters,2,357,Phoenix,Absolutely!
Turnabout sisters,2,358,Edgeworth,"Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!"
Turnabout sisters,2,359,Phoenix,Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!
Turnabout sisters,2,360,Edgeworth,WHAAAAT!?
Turnabout sisters,2,361,Phoenix,"Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is..."
Turnabout sisters,2,362,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,363,Phoenix,I present the defendant's cell phone.
Turnabout sisters,2,364,Judge,"Yes, we've seen that."
Turnabout sisters,2,365,Phoenix,Listen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim.
Turnabout sisters,2,366,Cellular,*beep*...
Turnabout sisters,2,367,Maya,[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]
Turnabout sisters,2,368,Mia,"[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]"
Turnabout sisters,2,369,Maya,[Again? What's it this time?]
Turnabout sisters,2,370,Mia,"[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, ""The Thinker."" And it tells you the time!]"
Turnabout sisters,2,371,Phoenix,"Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew ""The Thinker"" was a clock! Am I wrong!?"
Turnabout sisters,2,372,April,I... I...
Turnabout sisters,2,373,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,374,Edgeworth,"Your Honor, this is ridiculous!"
Turnabout sisters,2,375,Phoenix,"Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer."
Turnabout sisters,2,376,April,La... laaa... lrrrrgf!
Turnabout sisters,2,377,Judge,"Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?"
Turnabout sisters,2,378,April,...
Turnabout sisters,2,379,Judge,Miss May!
Turnabout sisters,2,380,April,"Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!"
Turnabout sisters,2,381,April,"I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!"
Turnabout sisters,2,382,Phoenix,(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)
Turnabout sisters,2,383,Phoenix,Why did you tap her phone?
Turnabout sisters,2,384,April,...
Turnabout sisters,2,385,Phoenix,Answer the question!
Turnabout sisters,2,386,April,Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?
Turnabout sisters,2,387,Phoenix,"(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that ""irrelevant""!"
Turnabout sisters,2,388,Judge,"While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point. Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?"
Turnabout sisters,2,389,Phoenix,(Hah! I'd like to see her pull THAT off!)
Turnabout sisters,2,390,April,"Mr. Lawyer, I saw that evil, evil grin! You were probably thinking ""I'd like to see her pull THAT off,"" weren't you!"
Turnabout sisters,2,391,Phoenix,(Damn... she's good!)
Turnabout sisters,2,392,April,"Well you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will!"
Turnabout sisters,2,393,Phoenix,You can't be serious! No way!
Turnabout sisters,2,394,April,"Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy..."
Turnabout sisters,2,395,Phoenix,R-room service!?
Turnabout sisters,2,396,April,"Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee."
Turnabout sisters,2,397,Phoenix,I-ice coffee...!?
Turnabout sisters,2,398,April,Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink*
Turnabout sisters,2,399,Edgeworth,"Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!"
Turnabout sisters,2,400,Phoenix,!
Turnabout sisters,2,401,Judge,"So, where does that leave us...?"
Turnabout sisters,2,402,Edgeworth,"It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder!"
Turnabout sisters,2,403,Phoenix,(No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...)
Turnabout sisters,2,404,Judge,"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"
Turnabout sisters,2,405,Phoenix,"Um, well... (Come on, think of something!)"
Turnabout sisters,2,406,Phoenix,"The defense would like to call the hotel bellboy as a witness! There's something suspicious there, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it!"
Turnabout sisters,2,407,April,I think you've sunken quite low enough already.
Turnabout sisters,2,408,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,409,Edgeworth,I object to calling the bellboy!
Turnabout sisters,2,410,Phoenix,W-why? What's your reason?
Turnabout sisters,2,411,Edgeworth,Because I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing!
Turnabout sisters,2,412,Phoenix,...!
Turnabout sisters,2,413,Edgeworth,"However... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness."
Turnabout sisters,2,414,Phoenix,Condition...?
Turnabout sisters,2,415,Edgeworth,"If Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of ""guilty"" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition."
Turnabout sisters,2,416,Phoenix,"(What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared ""guilty"" on the spot! What should I do...?)"
Turnabout sisters,2,417,Phoenix,"(Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!) Understood. I accept your condition."
Turnabout sisters,2,418,Edgeworth,Hmph. Fool... You fell right into my trap!
Turnabout sisters,2,419,Phoenix,"(Uh oh!) Uh... um, wait..."
Turnabout sisters,2,420,Judge,Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!
Turnabout sisters,2,421,Edgeworth,I believe we're ready for the witness to testify. He certainly does look like a bellboy.
Turnabout sisters,2,422,Bellboy,"Yes, sir. I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service."
Turnabout sisters,2,423,Judge,"That tea set looks rather heavy, so without further ado, the witness may begin his testimony."
Turnabout sisters,2,424,Bellboy,"Very good, sir!"
Turnabout sisters,2,425,Judge,I see. The defense may begin its cross-examination.
Turnabout sisters,2,426,Phoenix,R-right! I'm ready. (I hope... This is it... If I can't prove Miss May was involved with the murder now... Maya will be finished!)
Turnabout sisters,2,427,Bellboy,"I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations!"
Turnabout sisters,2,428,Phoenix,What exactly is it you do at the hotel?
Turnabout sisters,2,429,Bellboy,"Why, anything required of me, sir. I check in guests, I check out guests. I clean rooms, I make beds. I even deliver room service, sir. I checked Miss May in personally."
Turnabout sisters,2,430,Phoenix,Are you always so... so prim?
Turnabout sisters,2,431,Judge,Mr. Wright. You will refrain from asking frivolous questions...
Turnabout sisters,2,432,Bellboy,"I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May."
Turnabout sisters,2,433,Phoenix,Are you sure it was Miss May on the phone?
Turnabout sisters,2,434,Bellboy,"Absolutely, sir."
Turnabout sisters,2,435,Phoenix,H-how can you be so certain!?
Turnabout sisters,2,436,Bellboy,"I checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir."
Turnabout sisters,2,437,Judge,"Yes, what then?"
Turnabout sisters,2,438,Bellboy,"She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir."
Turnabout sisters,2,439,Phoenix,"9:00 ""on the dot,"" you say?"
Turnabout sisters,2,440,Bellboy,"Yes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir."
Turnabout sisters,2,441,Phoenix,(9:00... the time of the murder!)
Turnabout sisters,2,442,Bellboy,"I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course."
Turnabout sisters,2,443,Phoenix,"""Precisely"" 9:00, then?"
Turnabout sisters,2,444,Bellboy,"Precisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM."
Turnabout sisters,2,445,Phoenix,How can you be so sure!?
Turnabout sisters,2,446,Bellboy,"Miss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. ""Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!"" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir."
Turnabout sisters,2,447,Phoenix,(Why would she be so particular about the time?)
Turnabout sisters,2,448,Bellboy,"And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself."
Turnabout sisters,2,449,Phoenix,You are sure it was Miss April May herself?
Turnabout sisters,2,450,Bellboy,"Ab-SO-lutely, sir."
Turnabout sisters,2,451,Phoenix,"""Ab-SO-lutely""...?"
Turnabout sisters,2,452,Bellboy,"Yes, sir. As in, ""so very absolutely,"" sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine."
Turnabout sisters,2,453,Phoenix,How come you're so very certain!?
Turnabout sisters,2,454,Bellboy,"Well, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an ""embrasser,"" sir."
Turnabout sisters,2,455,Phoenix,"""Embrasser""!? Is that French for ""embrace""?"
Turnabout sisters,2,456,Bellboy,"It's French for ""kiss,"" sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek."
Turnabout sisters,2,457,Phoenix,Wh-why would she have done that...?
Turnabout sisters,2,458,Bellboy,"I believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir."
Turnabout sisters,2,459,Phoenix,(Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!)
Turnabout sisters,2,460,Phoenix,... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?)
Turnabout sisters,2,461,Edgeworth,"Tsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here!"
Turnabout sisters,2,462,Judge,Hmm. It was a bit tedious. The witness may leave the stand.
Turnabout sisters,2,463,Phoenix,(I can't let this happen... can I?)
Turnabout sisters,2,464,Phoenix,W-wait! Please wait!
Turnabout sisters,2,465,Judge,Yes? Does the defense have something to add?
Turnabout sisters,2,466,Phoenix,One last question... let me ask one last question!
Turnabout sisters,2,467,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,468,Edgeworth,"Your Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough!"
Turnabout sisters,2,469,Judge,"Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all."
Turnabout sisters,2,470,Phoenix,"(Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?)"
Turnabout sisters,2,471,Phoenix,T-tell me again about er... room service!
Turnabout sisters,2,472,Bellboy,"A-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall."
Turnabout sisters,2,473,Phoenix,I see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive?
Turnabout sisters,2,474,Bellboy,"Y-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir."
Turnabout sisters,2,475,Phoenix,(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?
Turnabout sisters,2,476,Bellboy,"Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!"
Turnabout sisters,2,477,Phoenix,Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?
Turnabout sisters,2,478,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,2,479,Edgeworth,I object! That was... objectionable!
Turnabout sisters,2,480,Judge,... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question.
Turnabout sisters,2,481,Bellboy,"Er... yes, I see."
Turnabout sisters,2,482,Phoenix,Why did you not mention this in your testimony!?
Turnabout sisters,2,483,Bellboy,"W-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask!"
Turnabout sisters,2,484,Phoenix,(Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!
Turnabout sisters,2,485,Bellboy,"Ah, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who..."
Turnabout sisters,2,486,Phoenix,!
Turnabout sisters,2,487,Bellboy,"He asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir."
Turnabout sisters,2,488,Edgeworth,Oof! Y-you fool!
Turnabout sisters,2,489,Phoenix,I've done it... I've won!
Turnabout sisters,2,490,Phoenix,Miss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?
Turnabout sisters,2,491,Bellboy,"Yes, sir."
Turnabout sisters,2,492,Phoenix,"Then, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?"
Turnabout sisters,2,493,Bellboy,"That's right, sir."
Turnabout sisters,2,494,Judge,Hmm...
Turnabout sisters,2,495,Phoenix,"Your Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?"
Turnabout sisters,2,496,Edgeworth,"Who! Who is this ""other person""!"
Turnabout sisters,2,497,Phoenix,"Simple, it was..."
Turnabout sisters,2,498,Phoenix,The man who checked in with Miss May!
Turnabout sisters,2,499,Edgeworth,Oof!
Turnabout sisters,2,500,Phoenix,"Your Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!!"
Turnabout sisters,2,501,Edgeworth,"M-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late..."
Turnabout sisters,2,502,Phoenix,"""Too late""? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court!"
Turnabout sisters,2,503,Edgeworth,Oof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous!
Turnabout sisters,2,504,Judge,Enough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully! Am I understood?
Turnabout sisters,2,505,Edgeworth,"Yes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor."
Turnabout sisters,2,506,Judge,That is all today for the trial of Maya Fey. Court is adjourned!
Turnabout sisters,2,507,Maya,Mr. Wright! You were amazing in there!
Turnabout sisters,2,508,Phoenix,R-really?
Turnabout sisters,2,509,Maya,I think I might be your newest fan!
Turnabout sisters,2,510,Phoenix,"Oh, I was just ""doing my job"" you know... heh heh."
Turnabout sisters,2,511,Maya,"Then again, that other attorney was pretty cool, too..."
Turnabout sisters,2,512,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout sisters,2,513,Maya,"That face of his! With his eyes wide, and trembling lips! It sent shivers up my spine!"
Turnabout sisters,2,514,Phoenix,Hmm... if you say so.
Turnabout sisters,2,515,Maya,"So, what happens with me? Do I get to go home now?"
Turnabout sisters,2,516,Phoenix,"Well, no. I don't think so. Not yet."
Turnabout sisters,2,517,Maya,Oh... I see.
Turnabout sisters,2,518,Phoenix,But I got a great lead in today's trial!
Turnabout sisters,2,519,Maya,"A ""lead""?"
Turnabout sisters,2,520,Phoenix,That man with Miss May! He's the key!
Turnabout sisters,2,521,Maya,"Oh! I get it. What happened to Miss May after that, anyway?"
Turnabout sisters,2,522,Phoenix,I heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed.
Turnabout sisters,2,523,Maya,Yes sir!
Turnabout sisters,2,524,Phoenix,I'm going to find out more about this man.
Turnabout sisters,2,525,Maya,Do you think he was the one who...?
Turnabout sisters,2,526,Phoenix,Maybe so.
Turnabout sisters,2,527,Maya,Sis...
Turnabout sisters,2,528,Phoenix,"Don't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise."
Turnabout sisters,2,529,Maya,I'm counting on you!
Turnabout sisters,3,0,April,"Well hello! I didn't expect anyone to visit me in such a dank place as this... It's really quite... moving. Not! You stinking lawyer! I hope you die! Have you come to laugh? Yes, laugh at the fallen Miss May!"
Turnabout sisters,3,1,Phoenix,"No, not really, there's something I wanted to ask."
Turnabout sisters,3,2,April,"Unfortunately, there is nothing I want to BE asked. Haven't you done enough questioning, you...! Spiky-head!"
Turnabout sisters,3,3,Phoenix,"(Here we go again...) Please, you're scaring the security guard."
Turnabout sisters,3,4,April,"... So? What is it you wish to ask of me, then? Hmm?"
Turnabout sisters,3,5,Phoenix,"(For starters, how did you get to be so totally whacked!?)"
Turnabout sisters,3,6,Phoenix,Have a look at this.
Turnabout sisters,3,7,April,"Look, I've said several times, I'm not telling you... ! Where did you...?"
Turnabout sisters,3,8,Phoenix,"(Ah hah! A reaction!) This is him, isn't it?"
Turnabout sisters,3,9,April,What? Who? When? Why...?
Turnabout sisters,3,10,Phoenix,It IS him. This is the man who stayed in your hotel room the night of the murder!
Turnabout sisters,3,11,April,"No! No, that's not right."
Turnabout sisters,3,12,Phoenix,"(Nice try, Miss Cooperative.)"
Turnabout sisters,3,13,April,D-do you have proof that was him? Hmm? Y-yeah! Proof! Show me proof!
Turnabout sisters,3,14,Phoenix,(I'm so close!)
Turnabout sisters,3,15,Bellboy,"Ah, welcome, sir! Quite the performance today, if I dare say so myself."
Turnabout sisters,3,16,Phoenix,"Oh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that."
Turnabout sisters,3,17,Bellboy,"No, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's ""rep,"" as they say."
Turnabout sisters,3,18,Phoenix,"Huh? ""Rep""?"
Turnabout sisters,3,19,Bellboy,"Yes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir!"
Turnabout sisters,3,20,Phoenix,"Whoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder."
Turnabout sisters,3,21,Bellboy,"I, too, will become famous! ""The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee""...!"
Turnabout sisters,3,22,Phoenix,(Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...)
Turnabout sisters,3,23,Bellboy,So! You are our honored guest. Please let me know if there is anything I can bring you!
Turnabout sisters,3,24,Phoenix,I wanted to ask you about the man who was with Miss May...?
Turnabout sisters,3,25,Bellboy,"Ah, yes... He struck me as a real ""Lady Killer,"" if you'll pardon the expression. I knew it from the moment I saw him, sir. He and I are of the same ilk. We both carry the scent of... danger."
Turnabout sisters,3,26,Phoenix,"(There we are in total agreement, Mr. Psycho Bellboy.)"
Turnabout sisters,3,27,Bellboy,"If you had a photo of that man, I'm quite sure I could identify him."
Turnabout sisters,3,28,Phoenix,(A photo. Hmm...)
Turnabout sisters,3,29,Phoenix,"What's this? Old photos? There are two lying here. Something's been written in pencil on the backs. ""DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A,"" ""DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B""... Let's take a look at these..."
Turnabout sisters,3,30,Phoenix,Why would Grossberg have a picture of this man...? This might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now. I'm just borrowing it. I'll return it later.
Turnabout sisters,3,31,Phoenix,"Wait a second... Wasn't there a giant painting hanging on that wall...? Yeah... yeah, it was a painting of fishermen."
Turnabout sisters,3,32,Phoenix,"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow."
Turnabout sisters,3,33,Phoenix,Take a look at this photo.
Turnabout sisters,3,34,Bellboy,"... That's him, Detective."
Turnabout sisters,3,35,Phoenix,Um... I'm the lawyer.
Turnabout sisters,3,36,Bellboy,"Oh, I know that! I just wanted to say ""Detective"" once. You know how it is."
Turnabout sisters,3,37,Phoenix,(No. No I don't.)
Turnabout sisters,3,38,Bellboy,"Without a doubt, that is the man who checked in with Miss April May. How about I write an affidavit swearing that that's him!"
Turnabout sisters,3,39,Phoenix,An affidavit? (This guy is way too excited about this...)
Turnabout sisters,3,40,Phoenix,"Well, sure. Why not?"
Turnabout sisters,3,41,Bellboy,"Yes! I've always wanted to write an affidavit, sir. From hence forth I will be known as the ""bellboy who swore the affidavit""!"
Turnabout sisters,3,42,Phoenix,Just hurry up and write it.
Turnabout sisters,3,43,Phoenix,(Not even Miss May can play dumb to this!)
Turnabout sisters,3,44,Phoenix,Thanks for this.
Turnabout sisters,3,45,Bellboy,"No no no, not at all, sir! I hope you'll use it to take that Miss May down hard, sir! Hard!"
Turnabout sisters,3,46,Phoenix,(Why do I sense an unhealthy level of excitement behind that unchanging smile? His tea set is rattling!)
Turnabout sisters,3,47,April,YOU AGAIN!? Can't you take a hint and stay gone?
Turnabout sisters,3,48,Phoenix,"Hey, the only reason I'm back here is because YOU won't talk to me!"
Turnabout sisters,3,49,April,"Oh, so it's MY fault now? You don't just have spiky hair, you also have a spiky heart."
Turnabout sisters,3,50,Phoenix,(That does it. When this case is done I'm shaving my head.)
Turnabout sisters,3,51,Phoenix,Could you have a look at this?
Turnabout sisters,3,52,April,What's that?
Turnabout sisters,3,53,Phoenix,The bellboy's affidavit! He told us everything he saw. He told us about the man you checked in with. He told us who he was.
Turnabout sisters,3,54,April,...!
Turnabout sisters,3,55,Phoenix,(Now I'm getting somewhere!)
Turnabout sisters,3,56,Phoenix,"(This is it, all or nothing! Time to do a little bluff.) No use playing dumb! (If, indeed, that's an act.) If you don't talk, I'm taking this photo to the press!"
Turnabout sisters,3,57,April,Whaaaaat!?
Turnabout sisters,3,58,Phoenix,"Even though he should be a witness to murder, this man is in hiding. I'm sure the press would have a field day with his reputation!"
Turnabout sisters,3,59,April,"...! Ooooh! Fine! I'll talk! You... you win, Lawyer."
Turnabout sisters,3,60,Phoenix,"(Yes! Man, that felt good! It's great to be alive!)"
Turnabout sisters,3,61,April,Why are you pumping your fists in the air?
Turnabout sisters,3,62,Phoenix,"*cough* Now, tell me about the man you were with."
Turnabout sisters,3,63,April,"That man... He's my boss. Redd White, the president of the information gathering conglomerate, Bluecorp."
Turnabout sisters,3,64,Phoenix,"(Redd... White?) ""Information gathering?"""
Turnabout sisters,3,65,April,Well... I suppose you could call them a detective agency.
Turnabout sisters,3,66,Phoenix,Hmm... So this is the man that was with you the night of the murder?
Turnabout sisters,3,67,April,... I'm... I'm scared to talk. I don't want to end up like her!
Turnabout sisters,3,68,Phoenix,"(...!) It's okay, I'll just ask Mr. White himself."
Turnabout sisters,3,69,Phoenix,Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located?
Turnabout sisters,3,70,April,...
Turnabout sisters,3,71,Phoenix,"(Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! If April May couldn't have done it, that leaves him! Time to take action!)"
Turnabout sisters,3,72,Phoenix,"(Alright, this is getting ridiculous. Where the heck is that loafer?)"
Turnabout sisters,3,73,Grossberg,*Ah-HHHHEM!*
Turnabout sisters,3,74,Phoenix,"(Ah, that old familiar clearing of the throat...)"
Turnabout sisters,3,75,Grossberg,Ah hah! You again.
Turnabout sisters,3,76,Phoenix,"Um, hello, Mr. Grossberg."
Turnabout sisters,3,77,Grossberg,"... Well, well. You were quite the thing, my boy."
Turnabout sisters,3,78,Phoenix,Excuse me...?
Turnabout sisters,3,79,Grossberg,The trial! The trial!
Turnabout sisters,3,80,Phoenix,(He was there...?)
Turnabout sisters,3,81,Grossberg,Reminded me of myself when I was a youth!
Turnabout sisters,3,82,Phoenix,(I guess something got passed down through Mia... maybe?)
Turnabout sisters,3,83,Grossberg,"It brings back memories, it does! ""Ah... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon..."" you see. ... I apologize."
Turnabout sisters,3,84,Phoenix,?
Turnabout sisters,3,85,Grossberg,"I... It was all a bit too much for me, my boy. Seeing you today, I... well, I... ..."
Turnabout sisters,3,86,Phoenix,"(I appreciate the reminiscing, but I'd much rather you gave me some information!)"
Turnabout sisters,3,87,Phoenix,So you came to see the trial?
Turnabout sisters,3,88,Grossberg,"Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see. I couldn't get a wink of sleep."
Turnabout sisters,3,89,Phoenix,Really? What was that?
Turnabout sisters,3,90,Grossberg,"Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl."
Turnabout sisters,3,91,Phoenix,"(If you were that worried about it, why didn't you offer to defend her!?)"
Turnabout sisters,3,92,Phoenix,"The other day I'm sure there was a big, pretentious-looking painting on that wall..."
Turnabout sisters,3,93,Grossberg,"""Pretentious-looking""...?"
Turnabout sisters,3,94,Phoenix,"Well... you know the one I mean. Anyway, where did it go?"
Turnabout sisters,3,95,Grossberg,"Ah, yes, well... I... got rid of it. Got quite tired of the thing, really. I, er, sold it, you see. Yes, that's right."
Turnabout sisters,3,96,Phoenix,"(Sold it!? I'm not sure I buy that...) Wasn't that painting rather important to you, sir? Did something happen?"
Turnabout sisters,3,97,Grossberg,"I don't see how it's any of your business! Please, speak no more of that accursed painting. I didn't... I... *mumble* *mumble*"
Turnabout sisters,3,98,Phoenix,"Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph..."
Turnabout sisters,3,99,Grossberg,Where did you get that!? Give it back at once!
Turnabout sisters,3,100,Phoenix,I'm sorry to have taken it without your knowledge. But... I have to know. Who is this man? He was most likely in April May's room the night of the murder.
Turnabout sisters,3,101,Grossberg,! What's that you say!? A-are you QUITE sure? My boy?
Turnabout sisters,3,102,Phoenix,(What has him so flustered I wonder...?)
Turnabout sisters,3,103,Grossberg,"I... I beg your pardon, but I must ask you to leave. I need to be alone."
Turnabout sisters,3,104,Phoenix,(...! He's fallen silent as a stone. A rather large stone. I guess I should return that photo.)
Turnabout sisters,3,105,Phoenix,... (What's with the surreal dÃ©cor...?)
Turnabout sisters,3,106,White,Welcome! Please furnish me with the title of your personage!
Turnabout sisters,3,107,Phoenix,(What the...?)
Turnabout sisters,3,108,White,Your name! What's your name? I was just inquirably asking the title that you go by.
Turnabout sisters,3,109,Phoenix,"Uh... Wright. Phoenix Wright. (""Inquirably""...?)"
Turnabout sisters,3,110,White,"Mr. Wright, is it? Right, I see... Splendiferous. Perhaps I have intimidated you with my giantesque vocabulary...?"
Turnabout sisters,3,111,Phoenix,(What is this guy's problem!)
Turnabout sisters,3,112,White,"I'm Redd White, CEO of Bluecorp. You know, Corporate Expansion Official? My business dealings bring me into contact with the elite of the elite. So I'm afraid I am not used to conversing with the wordily-challenged."
Turnabout sisters,3,113,Phoenix,(What a fruitcake!)
Turnabout sisters,3,114,White,"Hmmm, let me guess... You are an attorney fresh out of law school, are you not? That's the only explanation for why you would come to meet me like this!"
Turnabout sisters,3,115,Phoenix,(What does he mean by that?)
Turnabout sisters,3,116,White,"No matter. So, what business does a ""mighty"" lawyer have with a man such as myself?"
Turnabout sisters,3,117,Phoenix,(Yipes! This guy's arrogance meter is off the scale!)
Turnabout sisters,3,118,Phoenix,"Miss May is an employee of Bluecorp, is she not?"
Turnabout sisters,3,119,White,Correct. She was my secretariat. What a shock it was to hear what she has done!
Turnabout sisters,3,120,Phoenix,"""What she has done""... You mean the wiretap?"
Turnabout sisters,3,121,White,"Indeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods! It is ineffable that she would do this."
Turnabout sisters,3,122,Phoenix,(It sounds like he's trying to turn Miss May into a scapegoat...)
Turnabout sisters,3,123,Phoenix,On the night of the murder were you in April May's hotel room?
Turnabout sisters,3,124,White,"Who can say? I seldom pay attention to mundane details such as time and place. My motto is: ""Don't worry, be happy!"""
Turnabout sisters,3,125,Phoenix,"Still, Mr. White... The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly."
Turnabout sisters,3,126,White,"... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that."
Turnabout sisters,3,127,Phoenix,"(Hmm. He raises a good question, actually... Why didn't prosecution call him as a witness? He should have ""seen"" the same thing as April May!)"
Turnabout sisters,3,128,White,Oh hoh hoh. The police... the courts... To me they are mere toys. Playthings for my amusement!
Turnabout sisters,3,129,Phoenix,"What kind of company is Bluecorp, anyway?"
Turnabout sisters,3,130,White,"Ah, excellent question! We buy and sell various kinds of information. We are a company of the future! You might say, we ARE the future!"
Turnabout sisters,3,131,Phoenix,(Sell... information?)
Turnabout sisters,3,132,White,"In just 10 years, I've built this business up into the grand office you see now. Ah, in case you were wondering, Bluecorp was named after the color ""blue""! I, Redd White of Bluecorp, as founder and CEO, named it so! And why, you ask? Because I like the color blue of course! Fantabulistic, is it not?"
Turnabout sisters,3,133,Phoenix,Uh... there's something that's been bothering me.
Turnabout sisters,3,134,White,Yes? What might that be?
Turnabout sisters,3,135,Phoenix,That big painting on the wall over there...
Turnabout sisters,3,136,Phoenix,"You know, I've actually seen that painting before."
Turnabout sisters,3,137,White,Oh?
Turnabout sisters,3,138,Phoenix,"Just yesterday, actually."
Turnabout sisters,3,139,White,Your point being...?
Turnabout sisters,3,140,Phoenix,"My point is simple. Er, rather, my question is simple: Why is that painting hanging on your wall?"
Turnabout sisters,3,141,White,"... Mr. Wrong, was it?"
Turnabout sisters,3,142,Phoenix,Wright.
Turnabout sisters,3,143,White,It appears you do not fully grasp your position here. I ask again. Who are you?
Turnabout sisters,3,144,Phoenix,Umm... huh? A lawyer?
Turnabout sisters,3,145,White,"No, my feeble friend. A ""mere"" lawyer. Worth nothing. Zilch. Zippo. Nada! Just like that sorry excuse for an attorney, Grodyburger!"
Turnabout sisters,3,146,Phoenix,(Wh-what!?) Ungh! Oof...! Unh... uhhh... (He... he punched me!)
Turnabout sisters,3,147,White,"Well, Mr. Lawyer. What will you do, eh? Charge me with assault? Charge away, I welcome it! For it is YOU who will be found guilty!"
Turnabout sisters,3,148,Phoenix,What...?
Turnabout sisters,3,149,White,"Heed my exposition! The police, the courts, they all do my bidding."
Turnabout sisters,3,150,Phoenix,(So you say... But I wonder... Is that kind of control really possible?)
Turnabout sisters,3,151,White,"I don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your compensation. ... You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume?"
Turnabout sisters,3,152,Phoenix,Mr. Grossberg's... yes.
Turnabout sisters,3,153,White,Then you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you? Perhaps he will explain how a man can live life purely for personal profit! ... Go now! Skedaddle! There is nothing more to discuss!
Turnabout sisters,3,154,Grossberg,... ... ...
Turnabout sisters,3,155,Phoenix,(Huh? I don't think he's noticed me standing here. Maybe I should... clear my throat?) Aaa-HHHEM!
Turnabout sisters,3,156,Grossberg,Jumping Jehosephats! Oh! You!
Turnabout sisters,3,157,Phoenix,What's wrong? You looked so pensive... like an old man at the end of his days.
Turnabout sisters,3,158,Grossberg,Hmm? I'm not senile yet! I was just thinking about this whole mess...
Turnabout sisters,3,159,Phoenix,"(Something's really bothering him, that much is clear.)"
Turnabout sisters,3,160,Phoenix,"So, I paid Bluecorp a visit."
Turnabout sisters,3,161,Grossberg,"Oh? Oh, I see."
Turnabout sisters,3,162,Phoenix,"Mr. Grossberg... I have to admit, something has been bothering me."
Turnabout sisters,3,163,Grossberg,"Oh? What is it? Well, out with it, my boy!"
Turnabout sisters,3,164,Phoenix,"You see, it's just..."
Turnabout sisters,3,165,Phoenix,"Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had ""no intention of parting with""? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office."
Turnabout sisters,3,166,Grossberg,... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting...
Turnabout sisters,3,167,Phoenix,"Mr. Grossberg, I know you and Mr. White are connected somehow!"
Turnabout sisters,3,168,Grossberg,"C-connected, you say?"
Turnabout sisters,3,169,Phoenix,Yes! And I know what it is...
Turnabout sisters,3,170,Phoenix,Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail?
Turnabout sisters,3,171,Grossberg,...!
Turnabout sisters,3,172,Phoenix,I think that painting is fairly gaudy proof.
Turnabout sisters,3,173,Grossberg,"... Very well. This may be the chance I've been waiting for. Maybe it's time to get this off my chest, so I can finally rest easy again. After all, you were Mia's understudy. Perhaps it was fate?"
Turnabout sisters,3,174,Phoenix,(What's he talking about...?)
Turnabout sisters,3,175,Grossberg,"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation. Bluecorp is a company that excels in finding people's weaknesses, I'm afraid. I've been paying them for 15 years now..."
Turnabout sisters,3,176,Phoenix,(15 years...!)
Turnabout sisters,3,177,Grossberg,"All because of the ""DL-6 Incident,"" as you may have guessed."
Turnabout sisters,3,178,Phoenix,(The name on the back of those photographs!)
Turnabout sisters,3,179,Grossberg,"As you suspected, I could not stand in defense of Maya because of this. White would have destroyed me if I did."
Turnabout sisters,3,180,Phoenix,(So that's the connection!)
Turnabout sisters,3,181,Grossberg,"It is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible."
Turnabout sisters,3,182,Phoenix,Impossible? Why!?
Turnabout sisters,3,183,Grossberg,"He has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians."
Turnabout sisters,3,184,Phoenix,What!?
Turnabout sisters,3,185,Grossberg,"They are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years."
Turnabout sisters,3,186,Phoenix,"What is the ""DL-6 Incident""?"
Turnabout sisters,3,187,Grossberg,"""DL-6"" is nothing more than the sorting code the police gave the case. It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium."
Turnabout sisters,3,188,Phoenix,(A medium...?)
Turnabout sisters,3,189,Grossberg,Her name was Misty Fey.
Turnabout sisters,3,190,Phoenix,(Fey!)
Turnabout sisters,3,191,Grossberg,"Indeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud."
Turnabout sisters,3,192,Phoenix,(This is what Maya was talking about the other day!)
Turnabout sisters,3,193,Grossberg,"I did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident."
Turnabout sisters,3,194,Phoenix,"But why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg?"
Turnabout sisters,3,195,Grossberg,The DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him.
Turnabout sisters,3,196,Phoenix,You told White?
Turnabout sisters,3,197,Grossberg,"He offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail."
Turnabout sisters,3,198,Phoenix,... I see.
Turnabout sisters,3,199,Grossberg,... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office.
Turnabout sisters,3,200,Phoenix,Mia's office...?
Turnabout sisters,3,201,Grossberg,She followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found.
Turnabout sisters,3,202,Phoenix,"It's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here. Mr. Grossberg said there would be clues... Maybe I should have another look."
Turnabout sisters,3,203,Phoenix,All the cases the chief ever worked on are filed here. They're in alphabetical order. Let's take a look... Which file should I look at...?
Turnabout sisters,3,204,Phoenix,"Let's see if there's ""A"" record in this file that catches my ""I."" ""A""... ""B""... ""F""! ""Misty Fey."" That's Mia and Maya's mother. Hmmm... Should I take a look?"
Turnabout sisters,3,205,Mia,"""'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press. This parasite, who makes his fortune on threats and coercion... His name is..."""
Turnabout sisters,3,206,Phoenix,Hmm. The record stops there. ... So Mia knew Grossberg...
Turnabout sisters,3,207,Phoenix,"*sigh* Well, no harm in flipping through a bit, I guess... The biggest part's here at the end in ""S""... ""Suicide""? Eww... She has a collection of suicide reports. There's politicians... policemen... ... ...! There's writing on most of these in pencil. ""White""...? This is Mia's handwriting. Wait, I get it! Mia thought he was involved in these ""suicides""! White drove them all to... ... I can use these newspaper clippings. Hmm... let's find the most disturbing one..."
Turnabout sisters,3,208,White,"Well, aren't you persistent."
Turnabout sisters,3,209,Phoenix,"Sorry, but there's something I have to ask you."
Turnabout sisters,3,210,White,"Mr. Lawyer, I really hate having to repeat myself... But it seems the message has not yet penetrated your thick skull... Stop bothering me! If you try my patience further, I fear a nasty accident may occur. Do I make myself clear?"
Turnabout sisters,3,211,Phoenix,(Transparent...)
Turnabout sisters,3,212,Phoenix,(This is the only clue that Mia left me... I'd better make this one count!) Mr. White... see this? It's an article describing the suicide of a politician.
Turnabout sisters,3,213,White,...
Turnabout sisters,3,214,Phoenix,"He was embezzling secret government funds. Then, one day, word got leaked to the press. The very next day he took his own life."
Turnabout sisters,3,215,White,And this concerns me how...?
Turnabout sisters,3,216,Phoenix,I found this article in Mia's office.
Turnabout sisters,3,217,White,Miss Mia...?
Turnabout sisters,3,218,Phoenix,"She had a file filled with articles like this. Every one of them was labeled with a single word... ""White."""
Turnabout sisters,3,219,White,...!
Turnabout sisters,3,220,Phoenix,"Mr. White, I know what you did to this politician."
Turnabout sisters,3,221,Phoenix,You were blackmailing him!
Turnabout sisters,3,222,White,Blackmail?
Turnabout sisters,3,223,Phoenix,"Not just him, either. You were threatening and coercing hundreds of others! You were involved in all of the suicide cases that Mia investigated! This company is built on blackmail! I'm right, aren't I?"
Turnabout sisters,3,224,White,What a bizarre accusation. Mr. Wrong... What is it that you should be doing now? Investigating me? No no no. I think not! You should be searching for the one who killed Miss Mia!
Turnabout sisters,3,225,Interphone,*beep*
Turnabout sisters,3,226,Interphone,"[Secretary's Office, hello?]"
Turnabout sisters,3,227,White,Mr. Wrong will be leaving now.
Turnabout sisters,3,228,Interphone,"[Yes, sir. I'll send someone right away.]"
Turnabout sisters,3,229,Phoenix,"Wait a second, Mr. White..."
Turnabout sisters,3,230,Phoenix,"You are absolutely right. I should be looking for the killer now. And actually, I've done better. I've found him. He's sitting right in front of me."
Turnabout sisters,3,231,White,Just what are you insinuating?
Turnabout sisters,3,232,Phoenix,"Mia was on to you. She was keeping tabs. For this reason you had April May tapping her phone. Then, Mia was murdered, and all the documents about you mysteriously disappeared. So, the culprit would be...?"
Turnabout sisters,3,233,White,...
Turnabout sisters,3,234,Phoenix,"Even a child could work it out, Mr. White. You did it!"
Turnabout sisters,3,235,White,...
Turnabout sisters,3,236,Interphone,*beep*
Turnabout sisters,3,237,Interphone,[Secretary's office.]
Turnabout sisters,3,238,White,"We won't be needing an escort for Mr. Wrong. Instead, please connect me to the public prosecutor's office."
Turnabout sisters,3,239,Interphone,"[Of course, sir. One moment please...] ... [White? That you? What are you doing calling me at a time like this!?]"
Turnabout sisters,3,240,White,Hello. Chief Prosecutor? I've changed my mind. I want to testify tomorrow.
Turnabout sisters,3,241,Interphone,[What's this about?]
Turnabout sisters,3,242,White,"The Mia Fey case. I witnessed the murder, you see. And, thus, as a very important witness, I would like to testify."
Turnabout sisters,3,243,Interphone,[What? Why now? I thought you said you didn't want to go to court?]
Turnabout sisters,3,244,White,"Quietude...! I told you I changed my mind, didn't I? Oh, and one other thing. Send the police over here right away. The man is standing right in front of me. He looks dazed but could be violent!"
Turnabout sisters,3,245,Interphone,[What? What man?]
Turnabout sisters,3,246,White,"Are you even listening? The executioner! The hatchet-man! The liquidator... The killer, man!"
Turnabout sisters,3,247,Phoenix,What!?
Turnabout sisters,3,248,Interphone,[Mr. White... this isn't another one of those...]
Turnabout sisters,3,249,White,"Chief Prosecutor. I do not believe you are in a position to freely offer your opinions to me, correct? I'm telling you to send the police, now!"
Turnabout sisters,3,250,Interphone,*beep*
Turnabout sisters,3,251,White,"... Did I not tell you, Mr. Wrong? You are a mere lawyer! As was Miss Mia."
Turnabout sisters,3,252,Phoenix,How dare you!
Turnabout sisters,3,253,White,"I'll point the finger at you, and you will be tried as Miss Mia's killer! The case is as good as settled. No lawyer of any worth will defend you. I have friends in the local lawyer's association, you see. You'll be given a lawyer so stupendously inept that they make even you look competent."
Turnabout sisters,3,254,Phoenix,(I... I feel faint.)
Turnabout sisters,3,255,Gumshoe,"Detective Gumshoe, reporting, sir! Aaa! Butz! Hairy Butz!"
Turnabout sisters,3,256,Phoenix,"Wright, actually. Phoenix Wright. And my friend's name is ""Larry""..."
Turnabout sisters,3,257,Gumshoe,"Oh, right! Sorry, pal. Butz was that murderer, right?"
Turnabout sisters,3,258,White,"Detective Gumshoe. I present to you, the man who killed Miss Mia Fey!"
Turnabout sisters,3,259,Gumshoe,W-what!?
Turnabout sisters,3,260,White,"Take this despicable human being into custody. ... Farewell, Mr. Wrong!"
Turnabout sisters,3,261,Phoenix,"I can't believe it's only been a day since the first trial. My trial begins tomorrow. White's going to set a trap for me. And the prosecution will be in on it, of course. Edgeworth, included. An attorney was assigned to me by the state, yesterday. I refused. I had an idea."
Turnabout sisters,3,262,Maya,... Wright! Mr. Wright!
Turnabout sisters,3,263,Phoenix,"Oh, Maya! Great, they let you out of detention."
Turnabout sisters,3,264,Maya,"Just now, yes. It's all thanks to you!"
Turnabout sisters,3,265,Phoenix,Hah. Now I'm afraid we've switched places.
Turnabout sisters,3,266,Maya,"What? You mean, you...?"
Turnabout sisters,3,267,Phoenix,I explained what had happened to Maya. ...
Turnabout sisters,3,268,Maya,"I don't believe it! How many people does that man need to destroy before he's satisfied!? My mother... My sister... And now you! This has gone too far! Mr. Wright, please tell me, is there anything I can do?"
Turnabout sisters,3,269,Phoenix,Um... well...
Turnabout sisters,3,270,Phoenix,"Well, you could cheer for me in court."
Turnabout sisters,3,271,Maya,Cheer for you? You mean... like a cheerleader?
Turnabout sisters,3,272,Phoenix,"Huh? Um, yeah, like that."
Turnabout sisters,3,273,Maya,Alright! Leave it to me!
Turnabout sisters,3,274,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout sisters,3,275,Maya,I'd better go get a uniform and some pom-poms...!
Turnabout sisters,3,276,Phoenix,... W-wait. Wait wait wait.
Turnabout sisters,3,277,Maya,What what what?
Turnabout sisters,3,278,Phoenix,I'm kidding! It was a joke!
Turnabout sisters,3,279,Maya,No way!
Turnabout sisters,3,280,Phoenix,"No really, I was kidding. But thanks. It's good to know you're on my side. (And there really isn't anything you can do for me anyway...)"
Turnabout sisters,3,281,Maya,But... but I can't just sit here and do nothing! I've got to give that man a piece of my mind!
Turnabout sisters,3,282,Phoenix,"(Just a piece...?) Okay. Then, come to the court tomorrow."
Turnabout sisters,3,283,Maya,O-okay! I'll be there! I'll show them a thing or two!
Turnabout sisters,4,0,Judge,The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Turnabout sisters,4,1,Edgeworth,"The prosecution is ready, Your Honor."
Turnabout sisters,4,2,Phoenix,"The defense is ready, Your Honor."
Turnabout sisters,4,3,Judge,Mr. Wright... Are you sure you're up to doing this?
Turnabout sisters,4,4,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself."
Turnabout sisters,4,5,Judge,"Understood. Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please."
Turnabout sisters,4,6,Edgeworth,"As the details of the event are already quite clear to the court, today we will hear the testimony of another witness to the defendant's crime."
Turnabout sisters,4,7,Judge,I see. The prosecution may call its witness.
Turnabout sisters,4,8,Phoenix,"(That went far too smoothly! Why didn't the judge ask Edgeworth why his witness didn't testify before!? It's like... it's like he already knows why! Hmm. If anyone's going to raise an objection about this, I suppose it's me...)"
Turnabout sisters,4,9,Phoenix,"Mr. Edgeworth, you owe an explanation to the court! Why didn't this witness testify in the trial against Ms. Maya Fey!?"
Turnabout sisters,4,10,Edgeworth,"Hmph. I'm ever so sorry! Mr. White is a busy man, and besides... at the time, I thought that Ms. May's opinion was all that would be needed. Again, my sincerest apologies to the court."
Turnabout sisters,4,11,Judge,"Excellent, Mr. Edgeworth. I appreciate your demeanor."
Turnabout sisters,4,12,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout sisters,4,13,Phoenix,(Great. He gets to show off and I get nowhere.)
Turnabout sisters,4,14,Edgeworth,I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!
Turnabout sisters,4,15,Edgeworth,Please state your full name.
Turnabout sisters,4,16,White,You wish to know the title of my personage?
Turnabout sisters,4,17,Edgeworth,Er... your name?
Turnabout sisters,4,18,White,"Yes! That is what I said! Oh dear, do my locutions confuse?"
Turnabout sisters,4,19,Edgeworth,Name!
Turnabout sisters,4,20,Phoenix,(These two are great together...)
Turnabout sisters,4,21,White,"My name is Redd White. But my friends call me Blanco Nino. I am the CEO, or to use a more common term, the President, of Bluecorp."
Turnabout sisters,4,22,Edgeworth,"Did you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?"
Turnabout sisters,4,23,White,"That would be a negatory! No, I did not."
Turnabout sisters,4,24,Edgeworth,... You were at the Gatewater Hotel the night of the murder?
Turnabout sisters,4,25,White,Correct.
Turnabout sisters,4,26,Edgeworth,And you witnessed the murder from there?
Turnabout sisters,4,27,White,Ahem. Why tell you what you already know?
Turnabout sisters,4,28,Judge,"Very well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony."
Turnabout sisters,4,29,Phoenix,"(If I can't rip this guy's testimony apart, I'm done for. Why do I always feel like it's the end of the world and I'm the last man standing?)"
Turnabout sisters,4,30,White,"Ho hoh hoh. I hope you have made your peace with God, Mr. Lawyer!"
Turnabout sisters,4,31,Phoenix,...!
Turnabout sisters,4,32,Maya,"Let him have it, Phoenix!"
Turnabout sisters,4,33,White,"Let's see, it was about 9:00, I believe."
Turnabout sisters,4,34,Phoenix,How do you know what time it was?
Turnabout sisters,4,35,White,"Because I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect, you know?"
Turnabout sisters,4,36,Phoenix,"No no no, you're not getting away with that!"
Turnabout sisters,4,37,White,"You are so mistrusting, Mr. Lawyer! So... what was the proper term for ""secretary"" again...? Anyway, Miss May ordered room service for 9:00. It happened soon after the room service arrived."
Turnabout sisters,4,38,Phoenix,"(Hmm. That's what Miss May said, too.)"
Turnabout sisters,4,39,Phoenix,"True, the bellboy who brought the coffee saw Miss May. But he testified that he did not see you at the time!"
Turnabout sisters,4,40,White,Ahem. This is your concern? Silly Lawyer! Miss May received the coffee outside the room! Of course he could not see me. He would need X-ray vision to pull off something like that!
Turnabout sisters,4,41,Phoenix,(Hmm...)
Turnabout sisters,4,42,Edgeworth,"Tell us, what were you doing at the time?"
Turnabout sisters,4,43,White,"I was quietly perusifying... er, that's ""reading"" to you, some papers by the window."
Turnabout sisters,4,44,Phoenix,"By window, you mean the one directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Office?"
Turnabout sisters,4,45,White,"Correct! That is the only window, you see."
Turnabout sisters,4,46,Phoenix,And there you were reading... papers?
Turnabout sisters,4,47,White,"Correct! The Gatewater is a businessman's hotel, and I am a busy man who had business to do!"
Turnabout sisters,4,48,White,Then I heard a bedlam coming from outside!
Turnabout sisters,4,49,Phoenix,"A ""bedlam""?"
Turnabout sisters,4,50,White,"It must have been when you attacked, I assume."
Turnabout sisters,4,51,Edgeworth,We see. Continue.
Turnabout sisters,4,52,White,"Surprised, I turned to look at the building across the way."
Turnabout sisters,4,53,Phoenix,So you were reading your papers until you heard that sound?
Turnabout sisters,4,54,White,"But of course. I am no snoop, peeping out of windows at night."
Turnabout sisters,4,55,Phoenix,"(No snoop? Yeah, right! You've made a career out of snooping!)"
Turnabout sisters,4,56,White,It was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!
Turnabout sisters,4,57,Phoenix,S-spiky-haired!?
Turnabout sisters,4,58,White,"Needless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!"
Turnabout sisters,4,59,Phoenix,"What you just said directly conflicts with Miss May's testimony! Miss May clearly stated that the assailant looked like a ""girl""!"
Turnabout sisters,4,60,White,"I've always been proud of my eyesight, Mr. Lawyer."
Turnabout sisters,4,61,Phoenix,Just what is your eyesight?
Turnabout sisters,4,62,White,Counting both eyes... 40!
Turnabout sisters,4,63,Phoenix,40!? Don't add them together!
Turnabout sisters,4,64,Judge,I think the witness is trying to say his eyesight is good.
Turnabout sisters,4,65,Phoenix,"(Hey, whose side is the judge on, anyway?)"
Turnabout sisters,4,66,Edgeworth,And what did you do then?
Turnabout sisters,4,67,White,"I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was surprised of course."
Turnabout sisters,4,68,Phoenix,What was Miss May doing at that time?
Turnabout sisters,4,69,White,"She had just finished watching a soap opera on the TV, and was weeping openly."
Turnabout sisters,4,70,Phoenix,Did you know she had been tapping the Fey office phone?
Turnabout sisters,4,71,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,72,Edgeworth,Irrelevant! That has nothing to do with the case at hand.
Turnabout sisters,4,73,White,I care not. I will answer the lawyer's bold inquiry. Miss May was acting alone when she tapped the phone of this Fey woman.
Turnabout sisters,4,74,Phoenix,"You'd make a good politician, Mr. White."
Turnabout sisters,4,75,White,"Ho hoh! After all, I am ""El Presidente."""
Turnabout sisters,4,76,Judge,Please continue.
Turnabout sisters,4,77,White,"The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!"
Turnabout sisters,4,78,Phoenix,Can you be a little more detailed about that? I think it's worth knowing exactly what happened.
Turnabout sisters,4,79,White,"Of course! Comprende! I understand! The victim was attacked, by you, and ran to the left. You gave chase, and struck her down!"
Turnabout sisters,4,80,Edgeworth,Are you sure?
Turnabout sisters,4,81,White,"As you know, I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect!"
Turnabout sisters,4,82,Judge,Perhaps you could change your testimony to reflect this new detail.
Turnabout sisters,4,83,White,"The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!"
Turnabout sisters,4,84,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,85,Phoenix,Are you sure about that?
Turnabout sisters,4,86,White,How many times must I say it? I am abso-posi-lutely perfect! End of story!
Turnabout sisters,4,87,Phoenix,(How many times must I hear that?)
Turnabout sisters,4,88,Maya,Psst! Phoenix! Doesn't something about that strike you as a little odd?
Turnabout sisters,4,89,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,90,Phoenix,"Wait right there! Mr. White, you've dug your own grave!"
Turnabout sisters,4,91,White,What is this!?
Turnabout sisters,4,92,Phoenix,"You said the victim ran to the ""left."" But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony! She clearly stated that the victim ran ""right""!"
Turnabout sisters,4,93,White,...! Oh hoh hoh. It is simple. You have misheard her.
Turnabout sisters,4,94,Phoenix,"I think not. Look at the floor plans... The killer was here. And the victim, here. If the victim ran to the left, as you claim she did... She would have been running directly away from the door! She would have been running into a dead end! Don't you find that odd?"
Turnabout sisters,4,95,White,! Very strange... I did see her run to the left... I did.
Turnabout sisters,4,96,Maya,Phoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this one.
Turnabout sisters,4,97,Phoenix,True. (Maybe he really did see the victim run left...? So he did witness the killing...? Wait a second!)
Turnabout sisters,4,98,Judge,Mr. Wright?
Turnabout sisters,4,99,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor?"
Turnabout sisters,4,100,Judge,"Miss May says ""right,"" and Mr. White says ""left."" Can you explain this contradiction to the court?"
Turnabout sisters,4,101,Phoenix,Both witnesses are telling the truth. (For once...)
Turnabout sisters,4,102,Edgeworth,"Hah! I doubt it! Er, rather, that does not clear up the contradiction!"
Turnabout sisters,4,103,Phoenix,There is one scenario that would explain their conflicting accounts.
Turnabout sisters,4,104,Edgeworth,What!?
Turnabout sisters,4,105,Phoenix,"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!"
Turnabout sisters,4,106,Judge,Mr. Wright! What do you mean?
Turnabout sisters,4,107,Edgeworth,"Yes, what do you mean, he was not ""viewing the crime from the hotel""!? If he was not in the hotel, where could he have been!?"
Turnabout sisters,4,108,Phoenix,"In the law offices of Fey & Co., of course! More specifically, he was standing here! (Show the court where Mr. White was standing!)"
Turnabout sisters,4,109,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,110,Phoenix,"This is where he was! Look! When the victim ran for the door... If he was watching from this point, to him it would appear that she ran to the ""left."""
Turnabout sisters,4,111,Edgeworth,Please! This is no time for jokes in ill taste! That is where the killer was standing!
Turnabout sisters,4,112,Judge,Order! I will have order! Anyone disturbing the order of this courtroom will be held in contempt! Mr. Wright! What are you suggesting!?
Turnabout sisters,4,113,White,R-r-rapscallion!!!
Turnabout sisters,4,114,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,115,Edgeworth,"The postulations of the defense are a distortion of the truth, Your Honor!"
Turnabout sisters,4,116,Judge,Indeed. They do seem a bit far-fetched...
Turnabout sisters,4,117,White,"... Ho hoh hoh! You provide us with so much entertainment, Mr. Lawyer!"
Turnabout sisters,4,118,Phoenix,(What now!? He's... laughing!?)
Turnabout sisters,4,119,White,"The hilarity of the moment made me remember something... It appears I have been unclear, and for this, I apologize. Mr. Your Honor... Might I be allowed to testify once more?"
Turnabout sisters,4,120,Judge,"Very well, let's hear your revised testimony."
Turnabout sisters,4,121,Phoenix,"(Good luck. You can't fix a broken testimony, buddy!)"
Turnabout sisters,4,122,White,Miss May's testimony was correct... as was mine!
Turnabout sisters,4,123,Phoenix,What do you mean by that!
Turnabout sisters,4,124,White,"That is what I am about to explain! You Americans, always so impatient! It does not become you."
Turnabout sisters,4,125,Phoenix,"(Hey buddy, you're an American, too!)"
Turnabout sisters,4,126,White,"When you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left."
Turnabout sisters,4,127,Phoenix,"What do you mean ""first""?"
Turnabout sisters,4,128,White,"""First""? That is what comes before what happens ""next."" You do speak English, right? Please, sit back, relax. I will try to use simple words for your benefit. First, she ran to the left, and then..."
Turnabout sisters,4,129,White,"And then you hit her, savagely! That is what I saw."
Turnabout sisters,4,130,Phoenix,I didn't hit anyone!
Turnabout sisters,4,131,White,"Now, now, Mr. Wright. There is no point hiding things from this court."
Turnabout sisters,4,132,Phoenix,I'm not hiding anything!
Turnabout sisters,4,133,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,134,Edgeworth,The prosecution requests that the defense refrain from interrupting the testimony!
Turnabout sisters,4,135,Judge,"Mr. Wright, you have been warned."
Turnabout sisters,4,136,Phoenix,(Why's he mad at me!?)
Turnabout sisters,4,137,White,"Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right."
Turnabout sisters,4,138,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,139,Phoenix,"What do you mean ""next""!?"
Turnabout sisters,4,140,White,"""Next"" is what comes after ""first."""
Turnabout sisters,4,141,Phoenix,I know that!
Turnabout sisters,4,142,White,"Then that is all you need to know, Mr. Lawyer. As I said, she turned and made a desperate dash to the right."
Turnabout sisters,4,143,White,"You chased her, and delivered the final blow."
Turnabout sisters,4,144,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,145,Phoenix,Stop saying it was me!
Turnabout sisters,4,146,White,"But, it was you."
Turnabout sisters,4,147,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,148,Edgeworth,"Mr. Wright! If you claim that it was NOT you, then show us proof!"
Turnabout sisters,4,149,Phoenix,(Argh! Can I do nothing right? Nothing!?)
Turnabout sisters,4,150,White,May I continue?
Turnabout sisters,4,151,White,That is what Miss May saw.
Turnabout sisters,4,152,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,153,Phoenix,So each of you saw different parts...?
Turnabout sisters,4,154,White,"Abso-posi-lutely! That's right, of course!"
Turnabout sisters,4,155,Phoenix,(Where did he pick up that annoying phrase...?)
Turnabout sisters,4,156,White,"Anyway, moving along!"
Turnabout sisters,4,157,White,You see? You hit her twice!
Turnabout sisters,4,158,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,159,Phoenix,So were you watching both times?
Turnabout sisters,4,160,White,I suppose I was. And please excuse me for not testifying to this sooner!
Turnabout sisters,4,161,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,162,Phoenix,"Mr. White! The victim died from a ""single"" blow!"
Turnabout sisters,4,163,White,...!
Turnabout sisters,4,164,Phoenix,What do you have to say to that?
Turnabout sisters,4,165,White,Er... Erp!
Turnabout sisters,4,166,Phoenix,"(Now's my chance to hit him where it counts!) Mr. White. Wasn't it you who told this court you were ""abso-posi-lutely perfect""?"
Turnabout sisters,4,167,White,Mmph. I will refrain from using this phrase from now on.
Turnabout sisters,4,168,Phoenix,"Your Honor, if you could ask the witness for a new testimony..."
Turnabout sisters,4,169,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,170,Edgeworth,"The witness is obviously confused, Your Honor! I would like to request a 10 minute break!"
Turnabout sisters,4,171,Judge,"Yes... yes, quite."
Turnabout sisters,4,172,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,173,Phoenix,"The witness is confused because he's lying! I emphatically request that there be no break, Your Honor!"
Turnabout sisters,4,174,_,(Yeah! We want justice...!)
Turnabout sisters,4,175,_,(Don't let him get away!)
Turnabout sisters,4,176,Judge,Very well. If the witness would care to revise his testimony...
Turnabout sisters,4,177,Phoenix,"(The crowd's on my side! No slipping out of this now, White!)"
Turnabout sisters,4,178,Judge,Mr. White?
Turnabout sisters,4,179,White,O... okay...
Turnabout sisters,4,180,White,"Umm, well, see--I looked at the other window when I heard that thing fall."
Turnabout sisters,4,181,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,182,Phoenix,"You heard ""that thing fall""? What exactly was ""that thing""?"
Turnabout sisters,4,183,White,"Huh? Oh... oh, that? Umm... the glass light stand!"
Turnabout sisters,4,184,Phoenix,(Right... the one that had fallen over at the scene.)
Turnabout sisters,4,185,Maya,Phoenix! Doesn't something about that strike you as odd?
Turnabout sisters,4,186,Phoenix,"(Yeah, that is odd. I'll press further.) Mr. White."
Turnabout sisters,4,187,White,Huh? W-what?
Turnabout sisters,4,188,Phoenix,You're saying you saw the glass light stand?
Turnabout sisters,4,189,White,Y-yes.
Turnabout sisters,4,190,Phoenix,Then change your testimony to reflect that!
Turnabout sisters,4,191,White,S-sorry. My bad...
Turnabout sisters,4,192,Judge,The witness will revise his testimony.
Turnabout sisters,4,193,White,Okay okay. Of course.
Turnabout sisters,4,194,White,A light stand was lying on the floor when I looked.
Turnabout sisters,4,195,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,196,Phoenix,"The ""glass stand was lying on the floor""? That's the first I've heard of this. Why didn't you tell us about the stand before?"
Turnabout sisters,4,197,White,W-why? Me? W-well... I was instructed not to... wait! One moment! Give me a minute to gather my thoughts. I am so... so confused.
Turnabout sisters,4,198,Phoenix,(White's falling apart.)
Turnabout sisters,4,199,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,200,Edgeworth,"Your Honor! Please, I ask that you do not allow the witness to be badgered any further!"
Turnabout sisters,4,201,Judge,M-Mr. Wright. Please refrain from badgering the witness...
Turnabout sisters,4,202,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor. (Edgeworth is on the ropes!)"
Turnabout sisters,4,203,Judge,Very well. The witness may continue his account.
Turnabout sisters,4,204,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,205,Phoenix,Mr. White. It was impossible for you to have seen the light stand!
Turnabout sisters,4,206,White,Whaaaat!?
Turnabout sisters,4,207,Phoenix,The stand broke into pieces when it fell!
Turnabout sisters,4,208,White,Ooof!
Turnabout sisters,4,209,Phoenix,"Just by seeing the broken pieces you would have no idea it was a light stand! So tell me, exactly when was it that you saw the stand? Answer the question!"
Turnabout sisters,4,210,White,...! I-isn't it obvious? I saw the stand before it fell over!
Turnabout sisters,4,211,Phoenix,"So... you saw the stand before the victim was attacked, then?"
Turnabout sisters,4,212,White,"C-correct! That would be no problemo, right?"
Turnabout sisters,4,213,Phoenix,(Hmm...)
Turnabout sisters,4,214,Phoenix,"There's a big problemo, er, I mean problem here."
Turnabout sisters,4,215,White,What problem is this?
Turnabout sisters,4,216,Phoenix,"Mr. White, let me make sure I have this straight... You saw the glass light stand through the window, from the hotel... before the incident occurred?"
Turnabout sisters,4,217,White,"Correct! That is so! It's conclusive, definitive, undeniable... unimpeachable!"
Turnabout sisters,4,218,Phoenix,"No, it's impossible! You couldn't have seen the stand!"
Turnabout sisters,4,219,Judge,What? Why couldn't he? You have proof?
Turnabout sisters,4,220,Phoenix,"I sure do, Your Honor!"
Turnabout sisters,4,221,Phoenix,A person in the hotel could not have seen the stand before it fell over!
Turnabout sisters,4,222,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,223,Phoenix,Look at this!
Turnabout sisters,4,224,Judge,"These are the floor plans to the scene of the murder, yes?"
Turnabout sisters,4,225,Phoenix,"Correct, Your Honor. Now, look... If you were to look through the window at the office... This is the area you would be able to see! Here! Well...? Note that the stand is not within the visible area! Well, Mr. White! What do you have to say to that!?"
Turnabout sisters,4,226,White,Er... erp! Ri... dicu... losity...
Turnabout sisters,4,227,Phoenix,"Mr. White. If you were in the Gatewater hotel as you claim, you could not have seen the stand before it fell over! In fact, you wouldn't have been able to see it after it fell, either! There's no way you could have recognized the broken shards as a glass light stand! So, when did you see the stand, Mr. White? It must have been the moment that it fell! And the only place you could have seen that from... is inside the Fey Law Offices! In other words, you were at the scene of the crime, when the murder took place!"
Turnabout sisters,4,228,White,Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!
Turnabout sisters,4,229,Judge,Mr... White?
Turnabout sisters,4,230,White,...
Turnabout sisters,4,231,Phoenix,Mr. White.
Turnabout sisters,4,232,White,...
Turnabout sisters,4,233,Phoenix,"You did it, didn't you?"
Turnabout sisters,4,234,White,... Mr. Your Honor. I... I... Miss Mia... ...
Turnabout sisters,4,235,Phoenix,(Heh. Looks like we're about to get our verdict!)
Turnabout sisters,4,236,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,237,Edgeworth,"That's far enough, Phoenix Wright!"
Turnabout sisters,4,238,Phoenix,W-what!? (Urk! I forgot about Edgeworth!)
Turnabout sisters,4,239,Edgeworth,Mr. White...
Turnabout sisters,4,240,White,...
Turnabout sisters,4,241,Edgeworth,"I think the time has come. Shouldn't you confess your crime now, hmm?"
Turnabout sisters,4,242,White,W... what?
Turnabout sisters,4,243,Edgeworth,"I said, you should confess your crime. Ergo, confess that you placed the wiretap!"
Turnabout sisters,4,244,Phoenix,The w-wiretap!?
Turnabout sisters,4,245,Judge,Order! Order! Mr. Edgeworth! Explain to the court what you mean by this!
Turnabout sisters,4,246,Edgeworth,Distinguished members of of the court... Mr. White is slightly confused. Allow me to explain.
Turnabout sisters,4,247,Phoenix,(I really don't like the way this is headed...)
Turnabout sisters,4,248,Edgeworth,"As you know, Mr. White is the CEO of Bluecorp. He ordered his secretary, Miss April May, to tap the law offices of Ms. Fey."
Turnabout sisters,4,249,Judge,What does that have to do...?
Turnabout sisters,4,250,Edgeworth,"Your Honor. The question is: when was the wiretap placed in the office, and by who?"
Turnabout sisters,4,251,Phoenix,No! You wouldn't!
Turnabout sisters,4,252,Edgeworth,"Mr. White. In order to place the wiretap, you entered Ms. Fey's office. Am I correct...?"
Turnabout sisters,4,253,White,"... ! C-correct! You are most correct, Miles!"
Turnabout sisters,4,254,Phoenix,Give me a break!
Turnabout sisters,4,255,White,"Yes... in order to place the wiretap, I breached the Fey & Co. Law Offices! That is when I saw that accursed light stand!"
Turnabout sisters,4,256,Judge,"Now I'm confused. Please explain to the court what all this means, Mr. Edgeworth!"
Turnabout sisters,4,257,Edgeworth,"Gladly, Your Honor. Mr. Phoenix Wright has made his position quite clear. He has determined that Mr. White knew the glass stand was in the office. He has shown that there was only one time Mr. White could have seen the stand: At the very moment of the murder! Thus, Mr. Wright would like you to believe that Mr. White was the murderer!"
Turnabout sisters,4,258,Judge,I see.
Turnabout sisters,4,259,Edgeworth,"However! It is a fact that Mr. White had been to that office well before the murder took place! He went to place the wiretap! He could have seen the glass light stand then. Ergo, Mr. Phoenix Wright's theory is revealed for the baseless conjecture it is!"
Turnabout sisters,4,260,Judge,Mr. White! You will testify to the court about this wiretap!
Turnabout sisters,4,261,White,Ahem. Leave it to me!
Turnabout sisters,4,262,Phoenix,(I... I feel faint.)
Turnabout sisters,4,263,White,It was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.
Turnabout sisters,4,264,Phoenix,D-do you have proof!?
Turnabout sisters,4,265,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,266,Edgeworth,Miss April May knew the details of Ms. Fey's phone conversation! This proves that the wiretap was placed before the murder!
Turnabout sisters,4,267,Phoenix,Huh... right.
Turnabout sisters,4,268,White,I had entered the Fey & Co. Law Offices.
Turnabout sisters,4,269,Phoenix,Was it really you that went into the office? Or was it Miss May?
Turnabout sisters,4,270,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,271,Edgeworth,Unidentified fingerprints several days old were found in the Fey & Co. Law Offices. Those were obviously Mr. White's.
Turnabout sisters,4,272,Phoenix,"(And if I know Edgeworth, he's already run a check on those prints...)"
Turnabout sisters,4,273,Edgeworth,"Now, Mr. White. Tell us why you went to the Fey & Co. Law Offices."
Turnabout sisters,4,274,White,"Of course, I had done so to place the wiretap."
Turnabout sisters,4,275,Phoenix,Why did you tap Mia's phone!?
Turnabout sisters,4,276,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,277,Edgeworth,"That has no bearing on the current case, Your Honor."
Turnabout sisters,4,278,White,Bluecorp is a detective agency of sorts. We have a responsibility to protect client confidentiality!
Turnabout sisters,4,279,White,That is when I saw this glass light stand.
Turnabout sisters,4,280,Phoenix,Why did you notice something as innocuous as a light stand!?
Turnabout sisters,4,281,White,"The light stand was made entirely out of glass. It was quite stylish, so I guess it made a lasting impression on me. Such a beautacious thing deserves attention, does it not? That is all."
Turnabout sisters,4,282,Phoenix,(Uh oh! Don't tell me I've run out of ammo!)
Turnabout sisters,4,283,Edgeworth,"Tsk tsk. I'm afraid that's as far as you go, Mr. Wright. The time has come for you to admit your defeat! You fought... honorably."
Turnabout sisters,4,284,Phoenix,(No more... I can't take this anymore...)
Turnabout sisters,4,285,Judge,Mr. Wright? Are you giving up?
Turnabout sisters,4,286,Phoenix,"... Y-yes, Your Honor."
Turnabout sisters,4,287,Mia,(Phoenix!)
Turnabout sisters,4,288,Phoenix,...?
Turnabout sisters,4,289,Mia,(Phoenix! Over here!)
Turnabout sisters,4,290,Phoenix,(I know that voice! ... M-Mia!?)
Turnabout sisters,4,291,Mia,"Never give up, Phoenix!"
Turnabout sisters,4,292,Phoenix,...!!!! M-M-Mia...!
Turnabout sisters,4,293,Phoenix,"Where... Where am I? The waiting lobby...? What happened? ... Oh, right... I lost the trial. I was... hallucinating. ..."
Turnabout sisters,4,294,Mia,"Ah, you're finally awake."
Turnabout sisters,4,295,Phoenix,Gak!
Turnabout sisters,4,296,Mia,"H-hey! Phoenix! ... ""Gak""? That's no way to greet an old friend! Phoenix, I want you to look at me."
Turnabout sisters,4,297,Phoenix,Y-You're... M-Maya...?
Turnabout sisters,4,298,Mia,Didn't you know the Fey women have strong psychic powers...? When you accepted your defeat in court... It appears that was enough of a shock to awaken Maya's true powers.
Turnabout sisters,4,299,Phoenix,"So... Maya is channeling you, Mia?"
Turnabout sisters,4,300,Mia,"That's right. I am Maya, but I'm also Mia. Now, I want you to listen to me, Phoenix. Maya never gave up. You can't either! That's what I came here to tell you."
Turnabout sisters,4,301,Phoenix,...! B-but!
Turnabout sisters,4,302,Mia,"We don't have much time, Phoenix. Now listen. You've already won."
Turnabout sisters,4,303,Phoenix,Huh...?
Turnabout sisters,4,304,Mia,"You have that Receipt in the court record, right?"
Turnabout sisters,4,305,Phoenix,"Um... oh, yeah! The one you wrote ""Maya"" on...?"
Turnabout sisters,4,306,Mia,"Phoenix! White wrote that, not me!"
Turnabout sisters,4,307,Phoenix,So... so what do I do with it?
Turnabout sisters,4,308,Mia,Look at the front of the receipt!
Turnabout sisters,4,309,Phoenix,"The... front? (It's a regular receipt... Looks like it's from a famous department store. ""$1,000.00""... wow, big spender! ""Item""... ""glass light stand""...! ""Date of purchase""... ""September 4""...) ...! September 4!"
Turnabout sisters,4,310,Mia,"That's right, Phoenix. I bought that stand the day before I was killed!"
Turnabout sisters,4,311,Phoenix,Whoa!
Turnabout sisters,4,312,Mia,"Now, what did Mr. White say in his testimony?"
Turnabout sisters,4,313,White,It was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.
Turnabout sisters,4,314,Phoenix,He said he saw the stand the week before the murder!
Turnabout sisters,4,315,Mia,"There you go! I think the court is about to reconvene! Go do it, Phoenix! You know you're innocent, now you just have to prove it!"
Turnabout sisters,4,316,Phoenix,Right!
Turnabout sisters,4,317,Judge,"The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright. Is the defendant... rather, are you alright, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout sisters,4,318,Phoenix,"Yes. Sorry, Your Honor. I'm fine now."
Turnabout sisters,4,319,Judge,"Then, let's start where we left off."
Turnabout sisters,4,320,Edgeworth,Your Honor. There is nothing to go back to! The cross-examination of Mr. White is finished! All that is required now is for you to pass judgment on the defendant Phoenix Wright!
Turnabout sisters,4,321,Judge,Hmm...
Turnabout sisters,4,322,Phoenix,"Your Honor! Please, give me one more chance. I promise you, this is the last time I'll ask you!"
Turnabout sisters,4,323,Judge,"Hmm... But, as Mr. Edgeworth has noted, the trial is more or less finished. Mr. Edgeworth, do you have an opinion on this matter?"
Turnabout sisters,4,324,Edgeworth,"I say... let us give Mr. Phoenix Wright his ""last chance."""
Turnabout sisters,4,325,Judge,Very well! You may begin your cross-examination.
Turnabout sisters,4,326,White,It was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.
Turnabout sisters,4,327,White,I had entered the Fey & Co. Law Offices.
Turnabout sisters,4,328,White,"Of course, I had done so to place the wiretap."
Turnabout sisters,4,329,White,That is when I saw this glass light stand.
Turnabout sisters,4,330,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,331,Phoenix,"Look closely at this. See the word ""Maya"" written in blood...?"
Turnabout sisters,4,332,Edgeworth,Bwah hah! You're grasping!
Turnabout sisters,4,333,Phoenix,I think not. Look at the other side of the receipt.
Turnabout sisters,4,334,Edgeworth,Th-the other side?
Turnabout sisters,4,335,Phoenix,Your Honor. Would you tell the court what is written on the other side of that receipt?
Turnabout sisters,4,336,Judge,"Hmm... Well! A ""glass light stand""! And the date of purchase... Why, that's the day before the murder!"
Turnabout sisters,4,337,Phoenix,You see! Mr. White. When you allegedly entered Fey & Co. Law Offices at the beginning of September... The stand could not have been there!
Turnabout sisters,4,338,White,Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!?
Turnabout sisters,4,339,Phoenix,"Well, Mr. White? Can't get out of this one, can you?"
Turnabout sisters,4,340,White,No... It's impossachievable...
Turnabout sisters,4,341,Phoenix,"(Uh oh... he's losing it.) ... Well, Your Honor. I understand there must be quite a bit of PRESSURE on you. But I think you'll agree you can't judge me ""guilty"" under these circumstances."
Turnabout sisters,4,342,Judge,"! ...... Very well. Then, that is all for the trial of..."
Turnabout sisters,4,343,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,344,Edgeworth,"Not so fast, Phoenix Wright!"
Turnabout sisters,4,345,Phoenix,Eh? (What! No way he can worm his way out of this one! Oh wait... I forgot. It's Edgeworth.)
Turnabout sisters,4,346,Edgeworth,There is a certain thread of logic to the defendant's claims. However! There is no concrete proof that Phoenix Wright is innocent!
Turnabout sisters,4,347,Phoenix,(...!)
Turnabout sisters,4,348,Edgeworth,Ergo! I would like to request one more day before Phoenix Wright is granted his freedom. I need time to make one more inquiry into this matter.
Turnabout sisters,4,349,Judge,Hmm...!
Turnabout sisters,4,350,Phoenix,"(Another inquiry...!? This isn't going to be another one of those ""updated autopsy reports""! This guy just makes up evidence as he pleases! This is bad...!)"
Turnabout sisters,4,351,Phoenix,Mr. White's guilt is obvious! There is no need to prolong this trial any further!
Turnabout sisters,4,352,Judge,"Hmm. Well, Mr. Edgeworth?"
Turnabout sisters,4,353,Edgeworth,"If anyone is going to call Mr. White to trial, it would be me, the prosecution. I need a day to ascertain whether your claims have any basis in factual evidence!"
Turnabout sisters,4,354,Judge,Hmm. I see. Objection denied!
Turnabout sisters,4,355,Phoenix,Whaaaat!
Turnabout sisters,4,356,Judge,The completion of the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright will be postponed until tomorrow.
Turnabout sisters,4,357,Phoenix,(No! There's no telling what will happen if I can't end this now! Edgeworth is sure to come up with--or just make up--something! And after Mia showed up to help me and all...)
Turnabout sisters,4,358,White,Mr. Your Honor! May I go home?
Turnabout sisters,4,359,Judge,Of course. Thank you for your time.
Turnabout sisters,4,360,Phoenix,(Gah!)
Turnabout sisters,4,361,Mia,The witness will stay!
Turnabout sisters,4,362,Phoenix,(M-Mia...!)
Turnabout sisters,4,363,Mia,Phoenix! Read this note out loud.
Turnabout sisters,4,364,Phoenix,Mia? What's this...?
Turnabout sisters,4,365,Phoenix,Your Honor. If I may...?
Turnabout sisters,4,366,Judge,"You're quite persistent today, Mr. Wright!"
Turnabout sisters,4,367,Phoenix,(You bet I am! My life is riding on this one!) I have something I would like to read to the court!
Turnabout sisters,4,368,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout sisters,4,369,Phoenix,"(The memo Mia had given me was a list of names. Many of them sounded strangely familiar. People in finance, famous celebrities... That's when it happened.)"
Turnabout sisters,4,370,White,"S-s-stop! Desist! Halt! P-please, stop! Make him stop! How... how did you get that list!?"
Turnabout sisters,4,371,Mia,"Mr. White. Admit your guilt, right here, right now. Or else this list will be released to the press!"
Turnabout sisters,4,372,White,!!!
Turnabout sisters,4,373,White,"... I... I confess. I confess. I... I did it. I hit her. I hit Miss Mia with ""The Thinker""! ..."
Turnabout sisters,4,374,Mia,"Case closed, Your Honor."
Turnabout sisters,4,375,Judge,"Well, I see no reason to continue this trial. Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout sisters,4,376,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor."
Turnabout sisters,4,377,Judge,You've done it again! That was quite a spirited defense!
Turnabout sisters,4,378,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor. I guess you could say that. (If only you knew how ""spirit""-ed it was!)"
Turnabout sisters,4,379,Judge,"Hmm. Well! This court finds the defense... Ahem! Rather, the defendant, Mr. Phoenix Wright... Not Guilty"
Turnabout sisters,4,380,Judge,That is all. The court is adjourned!
Turnabout sisters,4,381,Mia,"Well, I never thought I'd be saying this again... But, congratulations! You're lucky I was born a Fey!"
Turnabout sisters,4,382,Phoenix,I'm lucky I had both you and Maya on my side.
Turnabout sisters,4,383,Mia,"I'm glad you made it. ... Thank you, Phoenix. You risked a lot to help me... and Maya. I won't forget it as long as I live!"
Turnabout sisters,4,384,Phoenix,"(As long as you ""live""...?)"
Turnabout sisters,4,385,Mia,... My time here's running out.
Turnabout sisters,4,386,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout sisters,4,387,Mia,Maya's powers are still weak. I can't stay here that long.
Turnabout sisters,4,388,Phoenix,W-what!? No! There's still so much to say!
Turnabout sisters,4,389,Mia,Don't worry. I'm sure we'll meet again.
Turnabout sisters,4,390,Phoenix,Ch-Chief!
Turnabout sisters,4,391,Mia,"Hee hee. I'm not the ""Chief"" anymore. Phoenix? Can you come to the office tonight... say, 9:00?"
Turnabout sisters,4,392,Phoenix,The office...?
Turnabout sisters,4,393,Mia,I'll see you later.
Turnabout sisters,4,394,Phoenix,Chief... Mia!
Turnabout sisters,4,395,Phoenix,"(Being here, it's hard not to think about that night...)"
Turnabout sisters,4,396,Maya,You came!
Turnabout sisters,4,397,Phoenix,Mia...
Turnabout sisters,4,398,Maya,I was kinda worried you might not.
Turnabout sisters,4,399,Phoenix,Huh? Of course I came...
Turnabout sisters,4,400,Maya,Well then! I'm pretty hungry. How about a burger?
Turnabout sisters,4,401,Phoenix,M-Mia...?
Turnabout sisters,4,402,Maya,... Bwah hah hah! You should see your face!
Turnabout sisters,4,403,Phoenix,Mia!
Turnabout sisters,4,404,Maya,What are you talking about? It's me! Maya!
Turnabout sisters,4,405,Phoenix,M-Maya...?
Turnabout sisters,4,406,Maya,"What, did I look like my sister?"
Turnabout sisters,4,407,Phoenix,(Look like... you WERE her!)
Turnabout sisters,4,408,Maya,"Hmm! I might be able to use that. ""Oh, Phoenix! Go to the store and buy me lunch, would you?"""
Turnabout sisters,4,409,Phoenix,"Uhm, Maya... Why are you here?"
Turnabout sisters,4,410,Maya,"Because of this! See? Mia wrote me a letter. ""Take care of Phoenix for me."""
Turnabout sisters,4,411,Phoenix,Take care of... huh?
Turnabout sisters,4,412,Maya,"She means the office! This office! Someone has to help with the new Wright & Co. Law Offices, right? And who better but me! Maya Fey, reporting for duty! Wait, no, on second thought, let's make this casual! Yo, Nick! Maya here, ready to get down to business! You... don't mind me calling you ""Nick,"" do you? It's a great name! Mia said that's what your friend Larry calls you."
Turnabout sisters,4,413,Phoenix,"(""Nick""...?)"
Turnabout sisters,4,414,Maya,You know what this means? We're partners!
Turnabout sisters,4,415,Phoenix,"You know, when I think about it... It is Maya's fault I'm here now. But... If it wasn't for her I'd probably be in jail! ""Wright & Co. Law Offices."" It's got a good ring to it. Yeah! Thanks, Maya!"
Turnabout sisters,4,416,Mia,"(Good luck, Phoenix. I'll always be here... watching.)"
Turnabout sisters,4,417,Maya,"Right! Okay, Nick, let's do it!"
Turnabout sisters,4,418,Phoenix,Huh? Do... what?
Turnabout sisters,4,419,Maya,"Burgers, dummy! Burgers! There's a great burger joint just down the street. C'mon! Time's a wasting!"
Turnabout sisters,4,420,Phoenix,O-okay! Wait up!
Turnabout samurai,1,0,Maya,"That rocked! ""See you in Hell, Evil Magistrate!!!"""
Turnabout samurai,1,1,Phoenix,Whoa! Stop waving that broom around!
Turnabout samurai,1,2,Maya,"Oh, Nick! I didn't know you were here!"
Turnabout samurai,1,3,Phoenix,Of course I'm here! What was that surreal show you were watching?
Turnabout samurai,1,4,Maya,"What!? Nick, you mean, you don't know the Steel Samurai!? He's only the most popular TV hero for young people!"
Turnabout samurai,1,5,Phoenix,"Young...? Like, how young?"
Turnabout samurai,1,6,Maya,Umm... 10 years old?
Turnabout samurai,1,7,Phoenix,Then what the heck are YOU doing getting all excited!?
Turnabout samurai,1,8,Maya,"Hey! I'm only 17! That's seven-""teen."" See? I'm a teen! Not like you, Nick."
Turnabout samurai,1,9,Phoenix,Hey! Don't talk to me like I'm your grandpa or something. I'm only 24 myself.
Turnabout samurai,1,10,Maya,"Then watch it with me! He's really cool! And... it's really popular! When they asked grade school kids what they wanted to be, ""Steel Samurai"" was no.1!"
Turnabout samurai,1,11,Phoenix,I really worry about kids these days.
Turnabout samurai,1,12,Maya,"Gramps! Well, the Steel Samurai's over. I guess it's time to close up the office."
Turnabout samurai,1,13,Phoenix,I guess... Wish we had some clients!
Turnabout samurai,1,14,Phoenix,A month has passed since my trial. Mia's murder was the talk of the town for some time... But no one paid any attention to the Wright & Co. Law Offices... How am I going to pay the rent this month?
Turnabout samurai,1,15,Maya,It'll be okay. I'm sure some big client is just around the corner!
Turnabout samurai,1,16,Phoenix,Hmph.
Turnabout samurai,1,17,Cellular,Brrrrring... Brrrrring...
Turnabout samurai,1,18,Cellular,*beep*
Turnabout samurai,1,19,Phoenix,H-hello? This is Phoenix.
Turnabout samurai,1,20,Maya,N-N-Nick!!!
Turnabout samurai,1,21,Phoenix,Maya? What? It's still early...
Turnabout samurai,1,22,Maya,I-it's the Steel Samurai! The Steel Samurai got arrested!
Turnabout samurai,1,23,Phoenix,Huh? You mean the guy on that show?
Turnabout samurai,1,24,Maya,Yes! They're saying that the Steel Samurai killed a villain!
Turnabout samurai,1,25,Phoenix,... Umm... Isn't that what he's supposed to do?
Turnabout samurai,1,26,Maya,"Yeah, on TV!"
Turnabout samurai,1,27,Phoenix,"Yeah, on TV."
Turnabout samurai,1,28,Maya,"No! I mean, he actually did it! In real life! He skewered a villain with his Samurai Spear!"
Turnabout samurai,1,29,Phoenix,I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
Turnabout samurai,1,30,Maya,"Just come to the office, quick! Please, Nick!"
Turnabout samurai,1,31,Cellular,*beep*
Turnabout samurai,1,32,Phoenix,(Maya's here... watching television.)
Turnabout samurai,1,33,TV,"Now for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show ""The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo."" He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the ""Evil Magistrate."" His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The ""Samurai Spear"" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further."
Turnabout samurai,1,34,Phoenix,... This has to be a joke.
Turnabout samurai,1,35,Maya,"No, no, no! It's a nightmare! The Steel Samurai is over! The world is over!"
Turnabout samurai,1,36,Cellular,Brrrrring... Brrrrring...
Turnabout samurai,1,37,Cellular,*beep*
Turnabout samurai,1,38,Maya,Yes... Wright & Co. Law Offices. ... What!? Nick! I-it's the Steel Samurai!
Turnabout samurai,1,39,Phoenix,W-what!?
Turnabout samurai,1,40,Maya,"Yes... yes, of course! We'll be right there!"
Turnabout samurai,1,41,Cellular,*beep*
Turnabout samurai,1,42,Maya,"Let's go, Nick!"
Turnabout samurai,1,43,Phoenix,Go? Go where?
Turnabout samurai,1,44,Maya,They have the Steel Samurai down in detention!
Turnabout samurai,1,45,Phoenix,So what!?
Turnabout samurai,1,46,Maya,"So, I've decided this will be our first case!"
Turnabout samurai,1,47,Maya,...
Turnabout samurai,1,48,Phoenix,"What's wrong, Maya? It's him! In the flesh!"
Turnabout samurai,1,49,Maya,Umm... Is that guy really him?
Turnabout samurai,1,50,Phoenix,"Whaddya mean ""that guy""? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him."
Turnabout samurai,1,51,Maya,"Um, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice."
Turnabout samurai,1,52,Phoenix,Whoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!?
Turnabout samurai,1,53,Will,Umm...
Turnabout samurai,1,54,Maya,Y-yes!?
Turnabout samurai,1,55,Will,Something wrong...?
Turnabout samurai,1,56,Maya,N-no! No!
Turnabout samurai,1,57,Phoenix,(This is getting off to a great start.)
Turnabout samurai,1,58,Will,"I know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you?"
Turnabout samurai,1,59,Maya,"D-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no."
Turnabout samurai,1,60,Will,"No, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams."
Turnabout samurai,1,61,Maya,Oh...
Turnabout samurai,1,62,Will,I guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah!
Turnabout samurai,1,63,Maya,Nick!
Turnabout samurai,1,64,Phoenix,What?
Turnabout samurai,1,65,Maya,"He's a good guy! I mean, he's good!"
Turnabout samurai,1,66,Phoenix,Yeah.
Turnabout samurai,1,67,Maya,He didn't do it!
Turnabout samurai,1,68,Phoenix,...
Turnabout samurai,1,69,Phoenix,Maybe you could start by telling us what happened.
Turnabout samurai,1,70,Will,"Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear."
Turnabout samurai,1,71,Phoenix,"The ""Samurai Spear""...?"
Turnabout samurai,1,72,Will,"Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon."
Turnabout samurai,1,73,Phoenix,"Now, where were you on the day of the murder?"
Turnabout samurai,1,74,Will,"Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here."
Turnabout samurai,1,75,Phoenix,(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)
Turnabout samurai,1,76,Will,What will the kids think? *sniff*
Turnabout samurai,1,77,Phoenix,I think I should probably check out the scene of the murder...
Turnabout samurai,1,78,Will,Right... Global Studios. I'll draw you a map.
Turnabout samurai,1,79,Maya,Wow! Nick! Let's go!
Turnabout samurai,1,80,Phoenix,(I'm willing to bet 10 bucks she asks for autographs.)
Turnabout samurai,1,81,Maya,Wow! So this is where they make the Steel Samurai show! Awesome! Aren't you excited!?
Turnabout samurai,1,82,Oldbag,"Hey! You there! You want in, you gotta go through me!"
Turnabout samurai,1,83,Maya,"O-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers."
Turnabout samurai,1,84,Oldbag,Oh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT.
Turnabout samurai,1,85,Maya,G-gawkers?
Turnabout samurai,1,86,Oldbag,"Gawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in..."
Turnabout samurai,1,87,Maya,"Umm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say ""no."""
Turnabout samurai,1,88,Phoenix,I dunno! It's possible.
Turnabout samurai,1,89,Oldbag,Hey! Listen when you're being spoken to! Youths today!
Turnabout samurai,1,90,Phoenix,"So, what do you do here at the studios?"
Turnabout samurai,1,91,Oldbag,"At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days..."
Turnabout samurai,1,92,Maya,No! You were a star!?
Turnabout samurai,1,93,Oldbag,"Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie."
Turnabout samurai,1,94,Maya,Wo... wow.
Turnabout samurai,1,95,Oldbag,"This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was..."
Turnabout samurai,1,96,Phoenix,Hammer...?
Turnabout samurai,1,97,Oldbag,"The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with..."
Turnabout samurai,1,98,Phoenix,Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?
Turnabout samurai,1,99,Oldbag,"He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his ""big chance."" No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer..."
Turnabout samurai,1,100,Maya,We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!
Turnabout samurai,1,101,Oldbag,Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.
Turnabout samurai,1,102,Phoenix,What kind of person was Jack Hammer?
Turnabout samurai,1,103,Oldbag,"What ""kind of person""? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!"
Turnabout samurai,1,104,Phoenix,(Should I have heard of that...?)
Turnabout samurai,1,105,Oldbag,"But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry."
Turnabout samurai,1,106,Phoenix,Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?
Turnabout samurai,1,107,Oldbag,"I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!"
Turnabout samurai,1,108,Phoenix,And... that person was Mr. Powers?
Turnabout samurai,1,109,Oldbag,Yes. I saw him!
Turnabout samurai,1,110,Phoenix,But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.
Turnabout samurai,1,111,Oldbag,"Oh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it."
Turnabout samurai,1,112,Oldbag,Isn't it about time for you to be heading home? There's nothing to see here. Move along.
Turnabout samurai,1,113,Phoenix,"Um, actually, we're here at Mr. Powers's request."
Turnabout samurai,1,114,Oldbag,"Hmph! I thought you were suspicious lookin'! Show me a ""letter of request."" And maybe I'll just let you in."
Turnabout samurai,1,115,Maya,"This lady here thinks she owns this place, obviously."
Turnabout samurai,1,116,Will,"Hello! How was the studio? They all think I did it, don't they?"
Turnabout samurai,1,117,Maya,"N-no, not at all! Isn't that right, Nick?"
Turnabout samurai,1,118,Phoenix,"Right, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect."
Turnabout samurai,1,119,Will,*sniff*
Turnabout samurai,1,120,Phoenix,Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...
Turnabout samurai,1,121,Will,"Oh, the security lady?"
Turnabout samurai,1,122,Maya,"She's terrible! She called me ""suspicious lookin'""!"
Turnabout samurai,1,123,Will,"Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. ""Take off that mask!"" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you."
Turnabout samurai,1,124,Maya,Grr! She's got some nerve!
Turnabout samurai,1,125,Phoenix,Do you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation?
Turnabout samurai,1,126,Will,Of c-course.
Turnabout samurai,1,127,Phoenix,(I just hope this will get me past that security lady.)
Turnabout samurai,1,128,Phoenix,"Ma'am, have a look at this. It's a letter of request from Mr. Powers."
Turnabout samurai,1,129,Oldbag,"Hmm...? Yes, yes. I recognize the bold, childish scrawl."
Turnabout samurai,1,130,Oldbag,To think he would entrust his fate to youths of such unreliable appearance... Really!
Turnabout samurai,1,131,Phoenix,Really?
Turnabout samurai,1,132,Oldbag,"Anyway, you may pass. But only left from here, toward the studios! No going to the right. That's the Employee Area. ""No one allowed inside, pal"" were my instructions. The good detective told me himself."
Turnabout samurai,1,133,Maya,"Hey, hey, Nick."
Turnabout samurai,1,134,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout samurai,1,135,Maya,There were maps in the security guard station.
Turnabout samurai,1,136,Phoenix,Hey! Not bad!
Turnabout samurai,1,137,Oldbag,"Those are 50 cents a piece, thank you!"
Turnabout samurai,1,138,Maya,"Well, time to go, Nick."
Turnabout samurai,1,139,Oldbag,50 cents!
Turnabout samurai,1,140,Gumshoe,Hey! Aren't you that murderer from the other day!
Turnabout samurai,1,141,Maya,Aah! It's that confused detective!
Turnabout samurai,1,142,Gumshoe,"Hey pal, you know Prosecutor Edgeworth is all upset, and it's your fault! I saw him sipping tea and staring gloomily out the window!"
Turnabout samurai,1,143,Phoenix,Umm... so?
Turnabout samurai,1,144,Maya,"Hey! If he's depressed, it's all your fault for doing sloppy detective work!"
Turnabout samurai,1,145,Gumshoe,!!! ... ... ...
Turnabout samurai,1,146,Maya,"Um, Detective?"
Turnabout samurai,1,147,Phoenix,I think you hurt his feelings.
Turnabout samurai,1,148,Maya,Oh no! I... I'm sorry!
Turnabout samurai,1,149,Phoenix,"Well, I think his feelings are easily hurt."
Turnabout samurai,1,150,Gumshoe,"You're right, pal. It's all my fault. I can blame other people all I want, but I know the truth in my heart!"
Turnabout samurai,1,151,Maya,"Hey, hey! Don't take it so hard! There's always the next case!"
Turnabout samurai,1,152,Gumshoe,"Yeah, I suppose you're right. Hey! What exactly are you two doing here?"
Turnabout samurai,1,153,Maya,"Um, well... We're on this case too, pal!"
Turnabout samurai,1,154,Gumshoe,"Huh!? Hey! You can't just go saying ""pal"" like that! That's MY endearing character trait!"
Turnabout samurai,1,155,Maya,I'd say he's a character alright...
Turnabout samurai,1,156,Phoenix,"So, how is your investigation going, Detective?"
Turnabout samurai,1,157,Gumshoe,"Well, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal."
Turnabout samurai,1,158,Maya,Nick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?
Turnabout samurai,1,159,Phoenix,"Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?"
Turnabout samurai,1,160,Gumshoe,What I got?
Turnabout samurai,1,161,Phoenix,"The autopsy report! The latest version, if you please..."
Turnabout samurai,1,162,Gumshoe,"Hmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal."
Turnabout samurai,1,163,Phoenix,About the security lady...
Turnabout samurai,1,164,Gumshoe,"Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!"
Turnabout samurai,1,165,Phoenix,Huh? A-are we talking about the same person?
Turnabout samurai,1,166,Gumshoe,When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!
Turnabout samurai,1,167,Maya,Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.
Turnabout samurai,1,168,Gumshoe,She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!
Turnabout samurai,1,169,Maya,Whaat!?
Turnabout samurai,1,170,Phoenix,What kind of evidence!?
Turnabout samurai,1,171,Gumshoe,"Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!"
Turnabout samurai,1,172,Maya,What! Who took that!?
Turnabout samurai,1,173,Gumshoe,"See the camera up on that gate, pal?"
Turnabout samurai,1,174,Maya,The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?
Turnabout samurai,1,175,Gumshoe,"Yeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!"
Turnabout samurai,1,176,Maya,"Oh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!"
Turnabout samurai,1,177,Phoenix,"(Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.)"
Turnabout samurai,1,178,Gumshoe,...
Turnabout samurai,1,179,Gumshoe,"What's wrong, pal? You seem down."
Turnabout samurai,1,180,Phoenix,Don't look so happy when you say that.
Turnabout samurai,1,181,Gumshoe,Oh hoh hoh hoh hoh!
Turnabout samurai,1,182,Maya,Umm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...
Turnabout samurai,1,183,Gumshoe,"Sure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!"
Turnabout samurai,1,184,Phoenix,(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)
Turnabout samurai,1,185,Maya,"Nick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!"
Turnabout samurai,1,186,Maya,Nick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!
Turnabout samurai,1,187,Phoenix,"Yeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them..."
Turnabout samurai,1,188,Oldbag,"Hey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?"
Turnabout samurai,1,189,Phoenix,(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)
Turnabout samurai,1,190,Phoenix,"Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?"
Turnabout samurai,1,191,Oldbag,"Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see."
Turnabout samurai,1,192,Phoenix,About the security camera...
Turnabout samurai,1,193,Oldbag,"Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do."
Turnabout samurai,1,194,Maya,Nick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!
Turnabout samurai,1,195,Phoenix,"(Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.)"
Turnabout samurai,1,196,Maya,"No one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?"
Turnabout samurai,1,197,Phoenix,"Right, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)"
Turnabout samurai,1,198,Maya,Hmm? This must be Powers's bag.
Turnabout samurai,1,199,Phoenix,"Hey, don't open that."
Turnabout samurai,1,200,Maya,Look!
Turnabout samurai,1,201,Phoenix,"An employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says ""Studio One."""
Turnabout samurai,1,202,Maya,"Let's take it, Nick!"
Turnabout samurai,1,203,Phoenix,Borrow it. You mean borrow.
Turnabout samurai,1,204,Phoenix,The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Turnabout samurai,1,205,Maya,"Let's go in and check it out, Nick!"
Turnabout samurai,1,206,Phoenix,I wonder if this cardkey we borrowed from the dressing room will work...
Turnabout samurai,1,207,_,*beep*
Turnabout samurai,1,208,Phoenix,It opened!
Turnabout samurai,1,209,Maya,Alright! We're in!
Turnabout samurai,1,210,Phoenix,(She's way too happy for someone visiting a crime scene.)
Turnabout samurai,1,211,Maya,...
Turnabout samurai,1,212,Phoenix,What is it?
Turnabout samurai,1,213,Maya,...
Turnabout samurai,1,214,Phoenix,You're real quiet all of a sudden.
Turnabout samurai,1,215,Maya,"Doesn't it give you the shivers, Nick? That white tape! It's so... so real!"
Turnabout samurai,1,216,Phoenix,"Well, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me..."
Turnabout samurai,1,217,Maya,"Look, a ladder!"
Turnabout samurai,1,218,Phoenix,"That's a ""step""-ladder."
Turnabout samurai,1,219,Maya,"So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!"
Turnabout samurai,1,220,Phoenix,R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)
Turnabout samurai,1,221,Maya,"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!"
Turnabout samurai,1,222,Phoenix,Yeah! So don't touch it!
Turnabout samurai,1,223,Maya,Whoa! It's heavier than I thought...
Turnabout samurai,1,224,Penny,Hey! You! No touching that!
Turnabout samurai,1,225,Phoenix,"Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know..."
Turnabout samurai,1,226,Maya,"""Y'know""!? No I don't know!"
Turnabout samurai,1,227,Phoenix,Umm... who are you?
Turnabout samurai,1,228,Penny,"Who me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera."
Turnabout samurai,1,229,Maya,We're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers.
Turnabout samurai,1,230,Penny,"Oh, you're WP's people."
Turnabout samurai,1,231,Maya,"""WP""...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it."
Turnabout samurai,1,232,Penny,"I don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent."
Turnabout samurai,1,233,Maya,"Don't worry, leave it to us!"
Turnabout samurai,1,234,Phoenix,Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder?
Turnabout samurai,1,235,Penny,"Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see."
Turnabout samurai,1,236,Maya,Only one assistant!?
Turnabout samurai,1,237,Penny,"Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now. And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences."
Turnabout samurai,1,238,Maya,I see. Neat!
Turnabout samurai,1,239,Penny,"In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else."
Turnabout samurai,1,240,Phoenix,"The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?"
Turnabout samurai,1,241,Penny,"Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that."
Turnabout samurai,1,242,Phoenix,Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?
Turnabout samurai,1,243,Penny,"No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!?"
Turnabout samurai,1,244,Phoenix,"W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.)"
Turnabout samurai,1,245,Phoenix,So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?
Turnabout samurai,1,246,Penny,Yes... I think.
Turnabout samurai,1,247,Phoenix,"(""I think"" doesn't cut it in a witness testimony.)"
Turnabout samurai,1,248,Maya,"Nick! What about that security lady! If someone else came into the studio, she must have seen them!"
Turnabout samurai,1,249,Maya,"What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph..."
Turnabout samurai,1,250,Phoenix,Hmm...
Turnabout samurai,1,251,Penny,Umm... Sorry... I know you're busy.
Turnabout samurai,1,252,Phoenix,Not really.
Turnabout samurai,1,253,Penny,"Actually, there's been something bothering me."
Turnabout samurai,1,254,Maya,Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!
Turnabout samurai,1,255,Penny,"Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here..."
Turnabout samurai,1,256,Phoenix,"You ""sensed""?"
Turnabout samurai,1,257,Penny,"Yes, several times."
Turnabout samurai,1,258,Phoenix,"Some other studio employees, maybe?"
Turnabout samurai,1,259,Penny,"No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside."
Turnabout samurai,1,260,Phoenix,R-really!?
Turnabout samurai,1,261,Maya,"But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?"
Turnabout samurai,1,262,Phoenix,"Yeah, you're right."
Turnabout samurai,1,263,Penny,I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.
Turnabout samurai,1,264,Maya,"No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!"
Turnabout samurai,1,265,Oldbag,What? You're still here? Really! You look as though you've seen a ghost!
Turnabout samurai,1,266,Oldbag,What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!
Turnabout samurai,1,267,Phoenix,"I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?"
Turnabout samurai,1,268,Oldbag,Sure as can be!
Turnabout samurai,1,269,Maya,"But we have a witness who thinks there was ""someone from outside"" here that day."
Turnabout samurai,1,270,Oldbag,What!?
Turnabout samurai,1,271,Maya,Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?
Turnabout samurai,1,272,Oldbag,...
Turnabout samurai,1,273,Maya,Ma'am?
Turnabout samurai,1,274,Oldbag,Who was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!?
Turnabout samurai,1,275,Maya,Eek!
Turnabout samurai,1,276,Oldbag,"Alright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!?"
Turnabout samurai,1,277,Maya,"Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One."
Turnabout samurai,1,278,Oldbag,"Her! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!"
Turnabout samurai,1,279,Phoenix,She left...
Turnabout samurai,1,280,Maya,"Well, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders!"
Turnabout samurai,1,281,Phoenix,The computer that runs the studio security cameras.
Turnabout samurai,1,282,Maya,Nick! Maybe we can see that photo of Powers with this computer!
Turnabout samurai,1,283,Phoenix,"Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?)"
Turnabout samurai,1,284,Phoenix,Okay. Let's give it a try.
Turnabout samurai,1,285,Maya,"You know how to work these things, Nick?"
Turnabout samurai,1,286,Phoenix,"Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)"
Turnabout samurai,1,287,Phoenix,There! Entered! ...
Turnabout samurai,1,288,Maya,Hey! It printed out the data for that day!
Turnabout samurai,1,289,Phoenix,Let's see what we got... ... Huh?
Turnabout samurai,1,290,Maya,How is this a picture of Will Powers?
Turnabout samurai,1,291,Phoenix,"Well, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him."
Turnabout samurai,1,292,Maya,I don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back.
Turnabout samurai,1,293,Phoenix,"Huh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]"
Turnabout samurai,1,294,Maya,What does that mean?
Turnabout samurai,1,295,Phoenix,Maybe there's more photo data from that day?
Turnabout samurai,1,296,Maya,Nope--that's the only one in the computer.
Turnabout samurai,1,297,Maya,"Hey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial?"
Turnabout samurai,1,298,Phoenix,Yeah.
Turnabout samurai,1,299,Maya,We'll put that security lady in her place with this!
Turnabout samurai,1,300,Phoenix,"Right, we'll put her in her place..."
Turnabout samurai,1,301,Maya,"Hey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says!"
Turnabout samurai,1,302,Phoenix,Wait. Let's not.
Turnabout samurai,1,303,Maya,Why not?
Turnabout samurai,1,304,Phoenix,It's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon.
Turnabout samurai,1,305,Maya,"Nick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate!"
Turnabout samurai,1,306,Phoenix,Hey! Why do I have to be the villain.
Turnabout samurai,1,307,Maya,"Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?"
Turnabout samurai,1,308,Phoenix,"I think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...?"
Turnabout samurai,2,0,Judge,The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.
Turnabout samurai,2,1,Edgeworth,"The prosecution is ready, Your Honor."
Turnabout samurai,2,2,Phoenix,"The defense is ready, Your Honor."
Turnabout samurai,2,3,Judge,"Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please."
Turnabout samurai,2,4,Edgeworth,"The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact."
Turnabout samurai,2,5,Judge,"Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness."
Turnabout samurai,2,6,Edgeworth,"First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand."
Turnabout samurai,2,7,Judge,"So the murder weapon was a ""spear""? How... medieval!"
Turnabout samurai,2,8,Edgeworth,"Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: ""What did the security lady at the guard station see?"""
Turnabout samurai,2,9,Judge,Understood.
Turnabout samurai,2,10,Edgeworth,Let's call this security officer to the stand!
Turnabout samurai,2,11,Edgeworth,Will the witness declare her name?
Turnabout samurai,2,12,Oldbag,"... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!"
Turnabout samurai,2,13,Edgeworth,"Y-your name, please!"
Turnabout samurai,2,14,Oldbag,"Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me ""grandma."""
Turnabout samurai,2,15,Edgeworth,"YOUR NAME, PLEASE!"
Turnabout samurai,2,16,Phoenix,(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)
Turnabout samurai,2,17,Oldbag,"Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me ""grandma."" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--"
Turnabout samurai,2,18,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,2,19,Edgeworth,O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.
Turnabout samurai,2,20,Judge,Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.
Turnabout samurai,2,21,Oldbag,"I was just getting to the good part, dearie!"
Turnabout samurai,2,22,Edgeworth,Perhaps we can get to the testimony?
Turnabout samurai,2,23,Judge,"Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?"
Turnabout samurai,2,24,Oldbag,Yessey I was.
Turnabout samurai,2,25,Judge,"And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?"
Turnabout samurai,2,26,Oldbag,"You know your stuff, dearie!"
Turnabout samurai,2,27,Judge,... You may begin your testimony.
Turnabout samurai,2,28,Phoenix,(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)
Turnabout samurai,2,29,Oldbag,"On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM."
Turnabout samurai,2,30,Phoenix,"So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?"
Turnabout samurai,2,31,Oldbag,"Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in."
Turnabout samurai,2,32,Phoenix,"(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)"
Turnabout samurai,2,33,Edgeworth,Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?
Turnabout samurai,2,34,Oldbag,Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
Turnabout samurai,2,35,Phoenix,"A ""run-through""...?"
Turnabout samurai,2,36,Oldbag,"They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon."
Turnabout samurai,2,37,Phoenix,(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)
Turnabout samurai,2,38,Edgeworth,"If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?"
Turnabout samurai,2,39,Oldbag,"I, well, I had some errands to run that morning."
Turnabout samurai,2,40,Phoenix,"What kind of ""errands""?"
Turnabout samurai,2,41,Oldbag,"Oh, well, you know."
Turnabout samurai,2,42,Phoenix,Answer the question!
Turnabout samurai,2,43,Oldbag,"Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?"
Turnabout samurai,2,44,Phoenix,O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?
Turnabout samurai,2,45,Oldbag,"Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!"
Turnabout samurai,2,46,Phoenix,(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)
Turnabout samurai,2,47,Oldbag,Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.
Turnabout samurai,2,48,Maya,Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!
Turnabout samurai,2,49,Phoenix,You could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.
Turnabout samurai,2,50,Maya,Not a bad idea...
Turnabout samurai,2,51,Oldbag,"Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station."
Turnabout samurai,2,52,Phoenix,Did you see the victim then?
Turnabout samurai,2,53,Oldbag,Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.
Turnabout samurai,2,54,Edgeworth,Tell us what happened next.
Turnabout samurai,2,55,Oldbag,I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
Turnabout samurai,2,56,Phoenix,So you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?
Turnabout samurai,2,57,Oldbag,"O-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!"
Turnabout samurai,2,58,Phoenix,"No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday..."
Turnabout samurai,2,59,Oldbag,I can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!
Turnabout samurai,2,60,Maya,"""Snipperwhapper""...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick."
Turnabout samurai,2,61,Phoenix,Why don't you raise an objection?
Turnabout samurai,2,62,Judge,"So, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?"
Turnabout samurai,2,63,Oldbag,"Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?"
Turnabout samurai,2,64,Phoenix,How did you know that?
Turnabout samurai,2,65,Oldbag,"Oh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job."
Turnabout samurai,2,66,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout samurai,2,67,Phoenix,"(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)"
Turnabout samurai,2,68,Oldbag,"Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM."
Turnabout samurai,2,69,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout samurai,2,70,Phoenix,2:00? You're sure?
Turnabout samurai,2,71,Oldbag,Sure as spit!
Turnabout samurai,2,72,Judge,"Well, who was the man!?"
Turnabout samurai,2,73,Oldbag,"Really, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something."
Turnabout samurai,2,74,Judge,...
Turnabout samurai,2,75,Oldbag,"Now, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!"
Turnabout samurai,2,76,Oldbag,"It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!"
Turnabout samurai,2,77,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout samurai,2,78,Phoenix,So you saw Mr. Powers?
Turnabout samurai,2,79,Oldbag,"That's what I said! Got wax in your ears, sonny?"
Turnabout samurai,2,80,Maya,"Nick, this is your chance!"
Turnabout samurai,2,81,Phoenix,"Yeah, time to pull out the secret weapon..."
Turnabout samurai,2,82,Oldbag,I'll say it again! It was him!
Turnabout samurai,2,83,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,2,84,Phoenix,"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you ""saw Mr. Powers,"" correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!"
Turnabout samurai,2,85,Judge,"J-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?"
Turnabout samurai,2,86,Phoenix,"None other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the ""Mr. Powers"" that you saw!?"
Turnabout samurai,2,87,Oldbag,"Of course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?"
Turnabout samurai,2,88,Edgeworth,"Um, yeah. ... Umm... well. I wonder?"
Turnabout samurai,2,89,Phoenix,"True, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!"
Turnabout samurai,2,90,Oldbag,...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!
Turnabout samurai,2,91,Judge,"No one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness."
Turnabout samurai,2,92,Phoenix,"(He's having trouble calling her ""Oldbag"" apparently...)"
Turnabout samurai,2,93,Judge,"However, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?"
Turnabout samurai,2,94,Oldbag,Humph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!
Turnabout samurai,2,95,Phoenix,What!?
Turnabout samurai,2,96,Edgeworth,Huh!?
Turnabout samurai,2,97,Phoenix,(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)
Turnabout samurai,2,98,Edgeworth,The prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!
Turnabout samurai,2,99,Oldbag,"How was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me ""this isn't any good as evidence, pal."" He didn't even give it a second look!"
Turnabout samurai,2,100,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout samurai,2,101,Phoenix,"(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)"
Turnabout samurai,2,102,Judge,"Let's hear about your proof, then."
Turnabout samurai,2,103,Oldbag,"I never say anything I don't mean, mind you!"
Turnabout samurai,2,104,Phoenix,Umm...
Turnabout samurai,2,105,Oldbag,Whippersnapper!
Turnabout samurai,2,106,Phoenix,"(Hey, I haven't said anything yet!)"
Turnabout samurai,2,107,Oldbag,"I'll have you know I'm not pointing fingers at anyone behind their backs! Everything I've said is on the straight and narrow! The up and up! Youth today! Always whining about each other, pointing fingers this way and that! It's enough to make an old lady want to cry..."
Turnabout samurai,2,108,Edgeworth,"Mr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness!"
Turnabout samurai,2,109,Phoenix,(I think Edgeworth has met his match...)
Turnabout samurai,2,110,Oldbag,"That morning, during the run-through of the action scene..."
Turnabout samurai,2,111,Phoenix,Who was present at the run-through?
Turnabout samurai,2,112,Oldbag,"Well, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me."
Turnabout samurai,2,113,Judge,And what exactly were you doing?
Turnabout samurai,2,114,Oldbag,Observing! Just... observing.
Turnabout samurai,2,115,Phoenix,What about the assistant?
Turnabout samurai,2,116,Oldbag,"Oh, she was off moving backdrops around and such."
Turnabout samurai,2,117,Phoenix,"(So she didn't see the run-through, then...)"
Turnabout samurai,2,118,Oldbag,I saw Powers trip and fall!
Turnabout samurai,2,119,Phoenix,"""Trip and fall""...?"
Turnabout samurai,2,120,Oldbag,"Yes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course."
Turnabout samurai,2,121,Judge,You... helped make it better?
Turnabout samurai,2,122,Oldbag,I kissed it where it hurt.
Turnabout samurai,2,123,Judge,"L-let's just skip over that part, shall we?"
Turnabout samurai,2,124,Phoenix,Where was the assistant then?
Turnabout samurai,2,125,Oldbag,"Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle."
Turnabout samurai,2,126,Phoenix,(Hmm...)
Turnabout samurai,2,127,Edgeworth,You may continue your testimony.
Turnabout samurai,2,128,Oldbag,"He broke one of the props, it was a big mess."
Turnabout samurai,2,129,Phoenix,He broke a prop?
Turnabout samurai,2,130,Oldbag,Sure did! His own Samurai Spear.
Turnabout samurai,2,131,Phoenix,(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)
Turnabout samurai,2,132,Oldbag,Luckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.
Turnabout samurai,2,133,Phoenix,(This strikes me as a significant detail... I'd better write this down in the Court Record.)
Turnabout samurai,2,134,Oldbag,"Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad."
Turnabout samurai,2,135,Phoenix,Was Mr. Powers' ankle badly sprained?
Turnabout samurai,2,136,Oldbag,Not so bad that he couldn't walk around. He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch.
Turnabout samurai,2,137,Phoenix,(Thus the nap...)
Turnabout samurai,2,138,Oldbag,"Anyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked."
Turnabout samurai,2,139,Phoenix,(Dragging his foot... okay.)
Turnabout samurai,2,140,Oldbag,You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!
Turnabout samurai,2,141,Phoenix,Are you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...)
Turnabout samurai,2,142,Judge,Hmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot.
Turnabout samurai,2,143,Oldbag,See! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper!
Turnabout samurai,2,144,Oldbag,That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?
Turnabout samurai,2,145,Phoenix,"Still, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!"
Turnabout samurai,2,146,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,2,147,Edgeworth,"Yes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!"
Turnabout samurai,2,148,Judge,He has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers.
Turnabout samurai,2,149,Phoenix,(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)
Turnabout samurai,2,150,Edgeworth,"I think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?"
Turnabout samurai,2,151,Judge,"Well, there is one thing that bothers me."
Turnabout samurai,2,152,Edgeworth,Which is?
Turnabout samurai,2,153,Judge,"Where is this ""Steel Samurai"" costume now?"
Turnabout samurai,2,154,Edgeworth,"Umm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though."
Turnabout samurai,2,155,Judge,Hmm...
Turnabout samurai,2,156,Edgeworth,"Anyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!"
Turnabout samurai,2,157,Judge,Hmm... I suppose that's right.
Turnabout samurai,2,158,Phoenix,"(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)"
Turnabout samurai,2,159,Phoenix,"Hold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!"
Turnabout samurai,2,160,Judge,"Hmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also."
Turnabout samurai,2,161,Edgeworth,"Then allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor..."
Turnabout samurai,2,162,Edgeworth,"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?"
Turnabout samurai,2,163,Oldbag,No need to ask twice!
Turnabout samurai,2,164,Oldbag,"The time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?"
Turnabout samurai,2,165,Phoenix,How do you know that?
Turnabout samurai,2,166,Oldbag,"Eh? Didn't I just explain? I gave donuts to the young detective. And the, after some rubbish about it being a ""secret, pal"" he told me everything."
Turnabout samurai,2,167,Phoenix,(I see Detective Gumshoe shares his fellow officer's fondness for donuts.)
Turnabout samurai,2,168,Oldbag,The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!
Turnabout samurai,2,169,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout samurai,2,170,Phoenix,Are you absolutely sure!?
Turnabout samurai,2,171,Oldbag,"Oh, quite, quite, sonny. Nobody suspicious lookin' passed by at all."
Turnabout samurai,2,172,Phoenix,(Nobody suspicious lookin'... Right.)
Turnabout samurai,2,173,Oldbag,No one else went there!
Turnabout samurai,2,174,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout samurai,2,175,Phoenix,What about before you got to the guard station?
Turnabout samurai,2,176,Oldbag,"You mean before 1:00? Why, everyone was in the Employee Area before then. And I locked the main gate so no one could get in. Not to mention..."
Turnabout samurai,2,177,Oldbag,"If they had, I would have seen them!"
Turnabout samurai,2,178,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout samurai,2,179,Phoenix,Are you sure!?
Turnabout samurai,2,180,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,2,181,Edgeworth,The witness has answered the question! Anyone going into the studio had to pass by the witness!
Turnabout samurai,2,182,Oldbag,"That's right, sonny! You let 'em have it, Edgey-boy!"
Turnabout samurai,2,183,Phoenix,(E-Edgey-boy...?)
Turnabout samurai,2,184,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout samurai,2,185,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,2,186,Phoenix,"Hold on! Look at this photograph one more time. This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct?"
Turnabout samurai,2,187,Oldbag,"Yesiree, sonny."
Turnabout samurai,2,188,Phoenix,"So, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture?"
Turnabout samurai,2,189,Oldbag,And here I thought you didn't know your head from a hole in the ground.
Turnabout samurai,2,190,Phoenix,Right... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data.
Turnabout samurai,2,191,Oldbag,"Ooh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening."
Turnabout samurai,2,192,Phoenix,"That very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]"
Turnabout samurai,2,193,Oldbag,"Even I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny!"
Turnabout samurai,2,194,Phoenix,"Actually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: ""Photo #2""..."
Turnabout samurai,2,195,Oldbag,"""Photo #2""...?"
Turnabout samurai,2,196,Phoenix,"The computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be ""Photo #1"" if it really was the ONLY photo!?"
Turnabout samurai,2,197,Judge,"Order! Order! Please tell the court what you mean by this, Mr. Wright!"
Turnabout samurai,2,198,Phoenix,"Actually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access... the security lady herself!"
Turnabout samurai,2,199,Oldbag,"Eh!? You watch your mouth, whippersnapper! The only person I saw that day was Will Powers!"
Turnabout samurai,2,200,Phoenix,But the camera on the gate fired twice! That means two people went by!
Turnabout samurai,2,201,Oldbag,"Umm... well, yes... that's what it would seem to mean..."
Turnabout samurai,2,202,Judge,Can the witness explain this to the court?
Turnabout samurai,2,203,Oldbag,Umm... ahem. I-I don't understand these new-fangled computer things... Umm... E-Edgey-boy! Help!
Turnabout samurai,2,204,Edgeworth,"Huh!? B-believe me, I want to, but I don't know what this means either."
Turnabout samurai,2,205,Oldbag,Humph! Some help you are! You're a whippersnapper too! ... ... Whippersnapper...?
Turnabout samurai,2,206,Judge,"Something the matter, Ms. Oldbag?"
Turnabout samurai,2,207,Oldbag,Ah! That's right! I... I just remembered something!
Turnabout samurai,2,208,Judge,Let me guess... Someone else passed by the gate... someone other than the Steel Samurai?
Turnabout samurai,2,209,Oldbag,"Er... well, yes, I suppose you could put it that way."
Turnabout samurai,2,210,Judge,"*sigh* I see. Your testimony, please."
Turnabout samurai,2,211,Oldbag,"Every day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do."
Turnabout samurai,2,212,Phoenix,"Another ""job""?"
Turnabout samurai,2,213,Oldbag,T-that's right. I check all the people that passed by the main gate that day. I look closely at every one of the photos that security camera takes.
Turnabout samurai,2,214,Edgeworth,Do you backup all of the security camera data?
Turnabout samurai,2,215,Oldbag,"Well, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating."
Turnabout samurai,2,216,Oldbag,I go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.
Turnabout samurai,2,217,Phoenix,"How many photos are there, usually?"
Turnabout samurai,2,218,Oldbag,"On a day when we're open to the public, we get more than 500 people. But on filming days or rehearsal days... well, we don't have much money. We never get more than 50, and that's a big day."
Turnabout samurai,2,219,Edgeworth,Do you backup all of the security camera data?
Turnabout samurai,2,220,Oldbag,"Well, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating."
Turnabout samurai,2,221,Oldbag,"I throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see."
Turnabout samurai,2,222,Phoenix,"How exactly do you determine what isn't ""suspicious lookin'""?"
Turnabout samurai,2,223,Oldbag,"Oh, you can tell by looking at their faces. For the most part."
Turnabout samurai,2,224,Phoenix,"F-for the most part? This is a murder trial, Ms. Oldbag!"
Turnabout samurai,2,225,Oldbag,"Well, I didn't touch that suspicious lookin' Will Powers's photo, did I?"
Turnabout samurai,2,226,Phoenix,(I think she's missing the point.)
Turnabout samurai,2,227,Oldbag,"Come to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!"
Turnabout samurai,2,228,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout samurai,2,229,Phoenix,"Well, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?"
Turnabout samurai,2,230,Oldbag,Humph. A fanboy.
Turnabout samurai,2,231,Phoenix,F-fanboy?
Turnabout samurai,2,232,Oldbag,"Steel Samurai fanboys. Real freaks, if you ask me. They get information about the rehearsals from gosh-knows-where. They're always hanging about. One was there that day."
Turnabout samurai,2,233,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,2,234,Phoenix,"W-wait a second! Didn't you just say no one else could get in!? ""I locked the main gate so no one could get in""... Those were your words!"
Turnabout samurai,2,235,Oldbag,"Well! If you must know, there's a drain that goes into the Employee Area. The grate has been loose for a while. It leads outside, and well, that's where they come in."
Turnabout samurai,2,236,Phoenix,They come in through the drain?
Turnabout samurai,2,237,Oldbag,"I told you they were freaks. Oh, and..."
Turnabout samurai,2,238,Phoenix,And...?
Turnabout samurai,2,239,Oldbag,They're kids. Children. Whippersnappers.
Turnabout samurai,2,240,Phoenix,"K-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...?"
Turnabout samurai,2,241,Oldbag,It was a boy. Probably 2nd or 3rd grade.
Turnabout samurai,2,242,Phoenix,Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Turnabout samurai,2,243,Judge,"O-order! Order! Let me get this straight. You saw two people pass by the gate on their way to the studios that day? One was the Steel Samurai, dragging his leg. The other was a boy who looked to be in about 2nd or 3rd grade?"
Turnabout samurai,2,244,Oldbag,"Oh yes, well we see his type there every day. Can't stop 'em. Can't catch 'em."
Turnabout samurai,2,245,Edgeworth,"A boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear?"
Turnabout samurai,2,246,Judge,"Impossible, I'd think. It's quite heavy."
Turnabout samurai,2,247,Oldbag,"Right! As I said, I didn't pay him much mind. That's why I erased the data."
Turnabout samurai,2,248,Maya,"Um, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect!"
Turnabout samurai,2,249,Phoenix,"Yeah, and they're already trying to ""un-suspect"" him."
Turnabout samurai,2,250,Judge,I'd like to take a five minute recess. I want the defense and the prosecution to consider this new information... And no forgetting vital information this time!
Turnabout samurai,2,251,Phoenix,Mr. WP?
Turnabout samurai,2,252,Will,Y-yes?
Turnabout samurai,2,253,Phoenix,Tell me straight: were you really in your dressing room? You didn't go to the studio?
Turnabout samurai,2,254,Will,"I-I didn't go to the studio! I was s-sleeping, honest."
Turnabout samurai,2,255,Maya,"So who was the ""Steel Samurai"" in that security photo?"
Turnabout samurai,2,256,Will,"How should I know? The Steel Samurai costume was off in the corner of the dressing room. Anyone could have walked in and taken it, really."
Turnabout samurai,2,257,Maya,What!? You should take better care of that stuff!
Turnabout samurai,2,258,Will,I couldn't imagine anyone would want to steal a Steel Samurai costume! So... where does this leave me?
Turnabout samurai,2,259,Phoenix,It doesn't look good...
Turnabout samurai,2,260,Will,*sniff*
Turnabout samurai,2,261,Phoenix,"You're the only likely suspect, right now."
Turnabout samurai,2,262,Maya,Nick! W-what are we going to do!?
Turnabout samurai,2,263,Phoenix,"First, we play for more time. We'll start targeting someone else that could conceivably have done this!"
Turnabout samurai,2,264,Maya,Right! And it'll take them so long to shoot us down that we can get another day!
Turnabout samurai,2,265,Phoenix,"Right... but if we pick the wrong person, we might lose on the spot."
Turnabout samurai,2,266,Will,You... don't sound very optimistic.
Turnabout samurai,2,267,Phoenix,"I'm not optimistic at all, actually."
Turnabout samurai,2,268,Maya,"Hey, Nick. It's time."
Turnabout samurai,2,269,Phoenix,Okay. Let's go. *sigh*
Turnabout samurai,2,270,Will,What does that mean... Please don't sigh like that! *sniff*
Turnabout samurai,2,271,Judge,"The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. Mr. Edgeworth, will you present the prosecution's thoughts on this matter?"
Turnabout samurai,2,272,Edgeworth,"The prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of ""guilty"" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!"
Turnabout samurai,2,273,Judge,"Hmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts?"
Turnabout samurai,2,274,Phoenix,The defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!
Turnabout samurai,2,275,Judge,"Order! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized."
Turnabout samurai,2,276,Phoenix,(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)
Turnabout samurai,2,277,Judge,"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?"
Turnabout samurai,2,278,Phoenix,It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!
Turnabout samurai,2,279,Oldbag,W-who!?
Turnabout samurai,2,280,Phoenix,"The Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through! There was only one person other than Powers and Hammer who knew about the injury. The security lady, Oldbag!"
Turnabout samurai,2,281,Oldbag,W-what!? Whippersnapper!
Turnabout samurai,2,282,Judge,"Order! Order! I-is this true, Oldbag!?"
Turnabout samurai,2,283,Oldbag,Oldbag!? That's Ms. Oldbag to you!
Turnabout samurai,2,284,Phoenix,"Ms. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!"
Turnabout samurai,2,285,Judge,W-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?
Turnabout samurai,2,286,Phoenix,"Simple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!"
Turnabout samurai,2,287,Judge,"I see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright."
Turnabout samurai,2,288,Phoenix,"(Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?)"
Turnabout samurai,2,289,Judge,"Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution have an opinion on this matter?"
Turnabout samurai,2,290,Edgeworth,... The prosecution has no meaningful objections at this time.
Turnabout samurai,2,291,Oldbag,"W-w-what!? What's that supposed to mean!? Oh, so you all think I did it? Is that it!? Edgey-boy! Don't just sit there, do something!"
Turnabout samurai,2,292,Phoenix,(What's my move? Maybe now's my chance to take this the whole way?)
Turnabout samurai,2,293,Phoenix,The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day!
Turnabout samurai,2,294,Oldbag,B-but why would I do something so horrible to poor Hammer!?
Turnabout samurai,2,295,Phoenix,"You forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too."
Turnabout samurai,2,296,Judge,Hmm... Indeed.
Turnabout samurai,2,297,Phoenix,(That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.)
Turnabout samurai,2,298,Oldbag,Wait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased!
Turnabout samurai,2,299,Judge,"He's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it?"
Turnabout samurai,2,300,Oldbag,"Th-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops!"
Turnabout samurai,2,301,Judge,"Hmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout samurai,2,302,Phoenix,That boy is not the killer.
Turnabout samurai,2,303,Oldbag,"What!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper!"
Turnabout samurai,2,304,Phoenix,I have proof.
Turnabout samurai,2,305,Oldbag,P-proof!?
Turnabout samurai,2,306,Judge,"Indeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?"
Turnabout samurai,2,307,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout samurai,2,308,Phoenix,"The scene of the murder, as we all know, was Studio One. However, you need a cardkey to enter Studio One! How could a boy with no formal relation to the studios have a cardkey!?"
Turnabout samurai,2,309,Judge,"I see! Well, would the witness care to comment on this?"
Turnabout samurai,2,310,Oldbag,Mrph.
Turnabout samurai,2,311,Phoenix,(The windbag... speechless. This has got to be a first.)
Turnabout samurai,2,312,Judge,"Very well! This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Mr. Edgeworth, please find out more about your witness, Ms. Windy... what was her name?"
Turnabout samurai,2,313,Edgeworth,"Something ""Oldbag,"" Your Honor."
Turnabout samurai,2,314,Judge,Then the prosecution will look further into this Oldbag before we continue! That is all. The court is adjourned!
Turnabout samurai,2,315,Oldbag,W-wait a second! I'm not going to just sit here while you run off barking up the wrong tree... me! I'm talking!
Turnabout samurai,2,316,Maya,"Oh, great, stop the presses! The windbag wants to talk!"
Turnabout samurai,2,317,Judge,Ms. Oldbag! What is this all about? Have you omitted something from your testimony?
Turnabout samurai,2,318,Oldbag,"Actually, if you must know, there's something I was told not to talk about."
Turnabout samurai,2,319,Phoenix,N-not to talk about?
Turnabout samurai,2,320,Edgeworth,By whom!?
Turnabout samurai,2,321,Phoenix,(Huh? You mean it wasn't Edgeworth who told her not to talk...?)
Turnabout samurai,2,322,Judge,"W-well, testify!"
Turnabout samurai,2,323,Oldbag,Global Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.
Turnabout samurai,2,324,Phoenix,"So, you were told not to talk?"
Turnabout samurai,2,325,Oldbag,"That's right! By the studio and TV bigwigs, no less!"
Turnabout samurai,2,326,Edgeworth,Why didn't I hear about this!?
Turnabout samurai,2,327,Oldbag,"Don't be too hard on yourself, sonny. We were all in on it."
Turnabout samurai,2,328,Oldbag,There were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.
Turnabout samurai,2,329,Phoenix,W-who were these people!?
Turnabout samurai,2,330,Oldbag,"Well, the director and the producer, for starters..."
Turnabout samurai,2,331,Phoenix,The... director?
Turnabout samurai,2,332,Edgeworth,We should have known something was fishy! How could they have done a run-through of their action scene without a director? Of course!
Turnabout samurai,2,333,Oldbag,"Yes, well, I was surprised no one asked about it."
Turnabout samurai,2,334,Phoenix,"So, where were these people?"
Turnabout samurai,2,335,Oldbag,The director was in the Employee Area all morning for the run-through. He joined the producer around lunchtime and they had a meeting after that.
Turnabout samurai,2,336,Edgeworth,Where!
Turnabout samurai,2,337,Oldbag,"Oh, in the Studio Two trailer."
Turnabout samurai,2,338,Phoenix,S-Studio Two...!? (There was a Studio Two...?)
Turnabout samurai,2,339,Oldbag,"Well, if you look at the guidemap... Here it is. You go through the gate and all the way to the left."
Turnabout samurai,2,340,Phoenix,(The path where the monkey's head was fallen over.)
Turnabout samurai,2,341,Judge,"Well, Mr. Wright... Would you like to continue the cross-examination...?"
Turnabout samurai,2,342,Phoenix,"(I think I've already asked all my questions, but...)"
Turnabout samurai,2,343,Phoenix,"Your Honor. We have learned there were others at Global Studios on the day in question. The director and the producer and, er, some bigwigs, were all present. Yet, as we stand here, they have not been questioned! I hold that it is impossible to declare a verdict on the defendant, Mr. Powers!"
Turnabout samurai,2,344,Judge,"Hmm... The court acknowledges the defense's point. The prosecution will gather more information about the witness, Ms. Oldbag... and more information about these other people we have just been told of!"
Turnabout samurai,2,345,Edgeworth,"... I understand, Your Honor."
Turnabout samurai,2,346,Judge,This ends the day's proceedings in the trial of Mr. Will Powers. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Turnabout samurai,2,347,Will,"Th-thank you so much, Mr. Wright. I was right to ask you to defend me."
Turnabout samurai,2,348,Maya,"Aww, really, it's nothing. *grin* Oh, or should I... *sniff*"
Turnabout samurai,2,349,Phoenix,We'll be going down to the studios to do some more investigation. We have to find out more about this director and producer. They'll be turning up in the next trial as witnesses for certain. So now's my chance to get material for the cross-examination!
Turnabout samurai,2,350,Maya,"So, Nick... Have we figured out just who it was in that Steel Samurai costume? Could it really have been old windbag?"
Turnabout samurai,2,351,Phoenix,"What do you think, Mr. Powers?"
Turnabout samurai,2,352,Will,"I don't think it was her, really."
Turnabout samurai,2,353,Maya,"Neither do I, Nick."
Turnabout samurai,2,354,Phoenix,"Y-yeah, I know! Look, I was just buying time back there. Someone had to be the bad guy for a bit to take the pressure off Mr. Powers."
Turnabout samurai,2,355,Maya,Poor old windbag... I feel kinda sorry for her.
Turnabout samurai,2,356,Phoenix,"Well, she wasn't winning any points in there, with or without my accusation. Okay, let's get down to the studios."
Turnabout samurai,2,357,Maya,Right! We'll be back to visit you soon...
Turnabout samurai,2,358,Will,"Th-thanks. Thanks, guys. *sniff*"
Turnabout samurai,3,0,Phoenix,"Whew, what a day."
Turnabout samurai,3,1,Maya,"This is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance?"
Turnabout samurai,3,2,Phoenix,I guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial.
Turnabout samurai,3,3,Maya,The director and producer...?
Turnabout samurai,3,4,Phoenix,"Yeah, them."
Turnabout samurai,3,5,Maya,"Well, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios!"
Turnabout samurai,3,6,Maya,No one's here.
Turnabout samurai,3,7,Phoenix,"Right, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her..."
Turnabout samurai,3,8,Maya,H-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them!
Turnabout samurai,3,9,Maya,"Hey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today."
Turnabout samurai,3,10,Phoenix,You're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial.
Turnabout samurai,3,11,Maya,"So, Nick... Remember that ""Studio Two"" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?"
Turnabout samurai,3,12,Phoenix,"Yeah, I think that's what they said."
Turnabout samurai,3,13,Maya,"Maybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!"
Turnabout samurai,3,14,Maya,This... is Studio Two?
Turnabout samurai,3,15,Phoenix,I thought so...
Turnabout samurai,3,16,Maya,"It doesn't really look much like a ""studio,"" does it?"
Turnabout samurai,3,17,Phoenix,"No, that it does not."
Turnabout samurai,3,18,Maya,Hey... There's a trailer over there.
Turnabout samurai,3,19,Phoenix,It looks pretty sturdy for a movie set trailer.
Turnabout samurai,3,20,Maya,Are we sure this is a studio?
Turnabout samurai,3,21,Maya,"Look, it's that assistant girl. Hey!"
Turnabout samurai,3,22,Penny,"Hi... WP's lawyers, right? I heard about the trial! Great job, guys!"
Turnabout samurai,3,23,Phoenix,Oh? Oh hoh hoh. Don't mention it.
Turnabout samurai,3,24,Penny,Is it true they caught the security lady!?
Turnabout samurai,3,25,Phoenix,Oh! Oh... oh hoh hoh!
Turnabout samurai,3,26,Penny,"Actually, she just called me. She told me to cover up that drain..."
Turnabout samurai,3,27,Phoenix,"You mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...)"
Turnabout samurai,3,28,Penny,"I... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right?"
Turnabout samurai,3,29,Maya,"Yeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right?"
Turnabout samurai,3,30,Penny,R-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them.
Turnabout samurai,3,31,Maya,"Oh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about!"
Turnabout samurai,3,32,Penny,You're right! I won't!
Turnabout samurai,3,33,Phoenix,"(Personally, I think she should worry at least a little bit more...)"
Turnabout samurai,3,34,Penny,"Um, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the guard station. I'm supposed to fill in for Ms. Oldbag."
Turnabout samurai,3,35,Maya,"Right! See you later, then!"
Turnabout samurai,3,36,Penny,Good luck with your investigation.
Turnabout samurai,3,37,Maya,"This is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder."
Turnabout samurai,3,38,Phoenix,"That's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping."
Turnabout samurai,3,39,Maya,"But Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then?"
Turnabout samurai,3,40,Phoenix,Huh... (She's got a point!)
Turnabout samurai,3,41,Phoenix,"Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said."
Turnabout samurai,3,42,Phoenix,There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Turnabout samurai,3,43,Maya,Wait... Nick!
Turnabout samurai,3,44,Phoenix,W-what now?
Turnabout samurai,3,45,Maya,These snacks... they've passed the expiration date!
Turnabout samurai,3,46,Phoenix,... Then don't eat them.
Turnabout samurai,3,47,Maya,*grumble* (They're snacks! They're meant to be eaten!)
Turnabout samurai,3,48,Penny,Oh... hello.
Turnabout samurai,3,49,Maya,Ho hoh! You look a little out of place.
Turnabout samurai,3,50,Penny,"It's the clothes, isn't it? I thought my camo vest might do the trick... Kind of an ""alternative guard fashion"" thing."
Turnabout samurai,3,51,Maya,Do kids sneak in here a lot?
Turnabout samurai,3,52,Penny,"Well... I don't think there's that many of them, but I do see one in particular a bunch. He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though..."
Turnabout samurai,3,53,Phoenix,I heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder...
Turnabout samurai,3,54,Penny,"Oh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet."
Turnabout samurai,3,55,Maya,So they were trying to protect the director?
Turnabout samurai,3,56,Penny,"More the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer!"
Turnabout samurai,3,57,Phoenix,"(The producer, huh?)"
Turnabout samurai,3,58,Manella,WTF? Who are j00 d00dz!? LMAO!
Turnabout samurai,3,59,Maya,"H-huh!? W-we... Wait, you first! Who are you!? You look pretty suspicious to me!"
Turnabout samurai,3,60,Manella,"Whatever, l4m3rs! How can j00 not know the great Sal Manella!? I make teh L33T SH0WZ! The Steel Samurai? Mine! RTFC! (Read The Film Credits!)"
Turnabout samurai,3,61,Maya,"R-really!? You're THE Sal Manella!? I'm so sorry! I, just, you looked so... Sorry!"
Turnabout samurai,3,62,Manella,"No no, quite alright. Really. It's fine. ROFL! ..."
Turnabout samurai,3,63,Maya,W-what is it?
Turnabout samurai,3,64,Manella,"You know, on closer inspection... Mmm... Yeah... Hot! Hot! Hot! *slobber* Hey, do j00 do a lot of ""cosplay,"" coz that costume r0x0rz!... *drool*"
Turnabout samurai,3,65,Maya,Rocksores!? Wh-wh-what... Hey! You're drooling!
Turnabout samurai,3,66,Manella,"Huh? Mmph! LOL! Buffer overrun! *pant* You've triggered my CR34T1V3 P0W3RZ! Yes... yes, it's coming to me! ""Pink Princess""! The sequel to the Steel Samurai... ""Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo!"" ROFL... LMAO!"
Turnabout samurai,3,67,Phoenix,"P-""Pink Princess""...?"
Turnabout samurai,3,68,Maya,"Why's it gotta be ""Little"" Olde Tokyo!? Why can't it have a cool name, like ""Neo Olde Tokyo""!?"
Turnabout samurai,3,69,Phoenix,"Maya, we really need to talk about ""cool""..."
Turnabout samurai,3,70,Phoenix,Did you notice anything unusual on the day of the murder?
Turnabout samurai,3,71,Manella,"Oh, I know who j00 d00dz are. That security lady told j00 about us, eh?"
Turnabout samurai,3,72,Phoenix,That's right.
Turnabout samurai,3,73,Manella,It was a pretty regular day. We had a run-through for an action scene in the morning. Then a meeting from lunchtime in the Studio Two trailer. Heh. I was so busy I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch! :(
Turnabout samurai,3,74,Phoenix,"A t-bone steak, was it?"
Turnabout samurai,3,75,Manella,Yeah... sux0rz! I hate missing out on food...
Turnabout samurai,3,76,Maya,"Nick... what does ""Sucksores"" mean?"
Turnabout samurai,3,77,Phoenix,No idea...
Turnabout samurai,3,78,Manella,"Anyway, I was in a meeting from noon till after 4:00. With the producer, and some bigwigs from the network."
Turnabout samurai,3,79,Phoenix,"(Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM. If he's telling the truth, that meeting gives him an alibi...)"
Turnabout samurai,3,80,Phoenix,About the producer who was at the meeting with you...
Turnabout samurai,3,81,Manella,"Oh, you mean Dee Vasquez? She's a genius. M4d sk1llz, all the way. Scary, though. *sweats* She brought these studios back from the brink of destruction. She's the one who made it possible for me to make the Steel Samurai!"
Turnabout samurai,3,82,Phoenix,"You had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right?"
Turnabout samurai,3,83,Manella,"Yeah, we were together from noon to 4:00 PM, the whole time."
Turnabout samurai,3,84,Phoenix,"Who exactly are these ""bigwigs"" people keep mentioning?"
Turnabout samurai,3,85,Manella,"Oh, the boss over at the network, and some sponsors. Also a few production guys. They piled into a limousine and got here right around noon. Major tension! *sweats*"
Turnabout samurai,3,86,Phoenix,Were all of them with you the entire time?
Turnabout samurai,3,87,Manella,"Yeah, unfortunately. They're all gray-haired geezers... *scowl*"
Turnabout samurai,3,88,Phoenix,(Hmm... sounds like they'd all be reliable witnesses.)
Turnabout samurai,3,89,Phoenix,(This place is deserted...)
Turnabout samurai,3,90,_,*crash!*
Turnabout samurai,3,91,Maya,Eek! N-N-Nick! W-w-what was that noise!? It sounded like it came from inside the trailer...
Turnabout samurai,3,92,Phoenix,Someone must be inside...
Turnabout samurai,3,93,Maya,H-Hello? ...
Turnabout samurai,3,94,Phoenix,No answer.
Turnabout samurai,3,95,Maya,"Pretty suspicious, if you ask me, Nick! Let's go in!"
Turnabout samurai,3,96,Phoenix,I'm not sure we should be barging in... ...Huh. It's locked.
Turnabout samurai,3,97,Maya,What? Don't we have a key?
Turnabout samurai,3,98,Phoenix,No. But there's probably one in the guard station at the main gate.
Turnabout samurai,3,99,Maya,Then what are we waiting for? Let's borrow it!
Turnabout samurai,3,100,Phoenix,(If they'll let us...)
Turnabout samurai,3,101,Oldbag,Ah hah! You again!
Turnabout samurai,3,102,Maya,Eeeek!
Turnabout samurai,3,103,Oldbag,"How rude, acting like you've seen a ghost!"
Turnabout samurai,3,104,Phoenix,You... certainly got back to your post quickly.
Turnabout samurai,3,105,Oldbag,"Oh the police took me away, they did. They pulled out a spare Steel Samurai costume! Told me to ""put it on."" Can you imagine? How could I, a sweet little old lady, wear a giant suit like that?"
Turnabout samurai,3,106,Phoenix,Mr. Powers is pretty tall...
Turnabout samurai,3,107,Oldbag,"As soon as they saw there was no way I could wear it, they let me go."
Turnabout samurai,3,108,Phoenix,(I guess that would rule out her being the murderer.)
Turnabout samurai,3,109,Oldbag,"Anyway! Know this, whippersnapper! This old lady NEVER forgets a slight or insult! And you won't get any information out of me! My lips are sealed!"
Turnabout samurai,3,110,Maya,You sure are talking a lot for someone with sealed lips.
Turnabout samurai,3,111,Oldbag,"Starting now! One, two, three, mmmph!"
Turnabout samurai,3,112,Phoenix,(This lady's too much...)
Turnabout samurai,3,113,Phoenix,"Umm, about that kid you said you saw..."
Turnabout samurai,3,114,Oldbag,"If I see him again, I'm taking him down!"
Turnabout samurai,3,115,Maya,N-Nick! Look at her eyes! She's serious!
Turnabout samurai,3,116,Maya,Hey! H-hey! Wait!
Turnabout samurai,3,117,Phoenix,(I'll bet he came in right through that drain...)
Turnabout samurai,3,118,Maya,"Hey, um, kiddy-o! What's yer name, sport?"
Turnabout samurai,3,119,Cody,"I'm not a kid, so don't talk to me like that!"
Turnabout samurai,3,120,Maya,H-huh!? But you... You are a kid! What a rude little brat. That's no way to talk to an adult!
Turnabout samurai,3,121,Cody,I don't see no adults here! Hippie fashion chick!
Turnabout samurai,3,122,Maya,H-hippie fashion...? Nick... I think I'm being mocked.
Turnabout samurai,3,123,Phoenix,"(You got to hand it to Maya, she's pretty sharp. And pretty mad...)"
Turnabout samurai,3,124,Cody,"I'm Cody! Cody Hackins. Call me ""kiddy-o"" again and I'll cut you down where you stand, evildoer!"
Turnabout samurai,3,125,Phoenix,"So, you're a fan of the Steel Samurai?"
Turnabout samurai,3,126,Cody,"How dare you utter that name, evildoer!"
Turnabout samurai,3,127,Maya,What do you mean? We're on the Steel Samurai's side!
Turnabout samurai,3,128,Cody,H-hah! Hah hah! You can't fool me!
Turnabout samurai,3,129,Maya,Okay... then what's the last line said by the innkeeper in Episode 8?
Turnabout samurai,3,130,Cody,"Hah! Easy! ""Like some fries with that?"""
Turnabout samurai,3,131,Maya,"Hmph... not bad, kiddy-o."
Turnabout samurai,3,132,Cody,Watch it!
Turnabout samurai,3,133,Phoenix,(What are they doing!?)
Turnabout samurai,3,134,Phoenix,"Say, you heard anything about the incident the other day?"
Turnabout samurai,3,135,Cody,...
Turnabout samurai,3,136,Maya,"You were here, weren't you?"
Turnabout samurai,3,137,Cody,...
Turnabout samurai,3,138,Phoenix,Did you see anything...?
Turnabout samurai,3,139,Cody,He... he...
Turnabout samurai,3,140,Phoenix,?
Turnabout samurai,3,141,Cody,"He... always... The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Yeah, I saw 'em! I saw everything!"
Turnabout samurai,3,142,Maya,What!?
Turnabout samurai,3,143,Cody,But... but no way am I telling you losers!
Turnabout samurai,3,144,Maya,Wha--!? Wait...
Turnabout samurai,3,145,Cody,Lemme go!
Turnabout samurai,3,146,Maya,... He's gone. Huh? Something fell off the table when he bumped into it on his way out.
Turnabout samurai,3,147,Phoenix,"A... bottle? Why was this sitting there, I wonder?"
Turnabout samurai,3,148,Phoenix,"Anyway, what was that kid saying?"
Turnabout samurai,3,149,Maya,"He ""saw everything""..."
Turnabout samurai,3,150,Maya,Huh? Where's that old windbag?
Turnabout samurai,3,151,Phoenix,Odd of her to leave her post...
Turnabout samurai,3,152,Oldbag,(H-hey!!!)
Turnabout samurai,3,153,Maya,Nick! That was her!
Turnabout samurai,3,154,Oldbag,(S-stop! Whippersnapper!)
Turnabout samurai,3,155,Phoenix,Y-yeah. Sounds like she's chasing after that boy.
Turnabout samurai,3,156,Oldbag,Natch!
Turnabout samurai,3,157,Maya,"Uh oh, she tripped!"
Turnabout samurai,3,158,Phoenix,(Maya sure looks happy...)
Turnabout samurai,3,159,Maya,"Hey, hey, Nick. Now's our chance! Let's check out the guard station!"
Turnabout samurai,3,160,Phoenix,Good idea.
Turnabout samurai,3,161,Maya,"... Oh! This is it, Nick! The ""Trailer Key""!"
Turnabout samurai,3,162,Phoenix,The key to that trailer in Studio Two!
Turnabout samurai,3,163,Maya,"We'll be borrowing this, right, Nick?"
Turnabout samurai,3,164,Phoenix,I wonder if the key we borrowed from the guard station will work? ... It opened.
Turnabout samurai,3,165,Maya,"Great! Let's go, Nick!"
Turnabout samurai,3,166,Phoenix,(She seems eager all of a sudden...)
Turnabout samurai,3,167,Maya,"Well, you first, Nick!"
Turnabout samurai,3,168,Phoenix,"(Ah, not THAT eager.)"
Turnabout samurai,3,169,Vasquez,...
Turnabout samurai,3,170,Maya,Eek! S-someone's in here!
Turnabout samurai,3,171,Vasquez,Names.
Turnabout samurai,3,172,Maya,"O-our n-names? Um, w-we're WP's lawyers, and, um..."
Turnabout samurai,3,173,Vasquez,I see. ...
Turnabout samurai,3,174,Maya,A-and who might you...?
Turnabout samurai,3,175,Vasquez,Dee Vasquez. The producer.
Turnabout samurai,3,176,Phoenix,(Dee Vasquez... She's quite beautiful.)
Turnabout samurai,3,177,Phoenix,I was wondering if you could tell me about the day of the murder...
Turnabout samurai,3,178,Vasquez,... ...
Turnabout samurai,3,179,Phoenix,M-Ms. Vasquez?
Turnabout samurai,3,180,Vasquez,Script.
Turnabout samurai,3,181,Phoenix,E-excuse me?
Turnabout samurai,3,182,Vasquez,Script. I'm looking for a script.
Turnabout samurai,3,183,Phoenix,A s-script?
Turnabout samurai,3,184,Vasquez,"""The Steel Samurai, Episode 13."" I need it."
Turnabout samurai,3,185,Maya,Umm... could we ask you a bit about the day of the murder?
Turnabout samurai,3,186,Vasquez,I need to read it. ...
Turnabout samurai,3,187,Maya,...
Turnabout samurai,3,188,Phoenix,... (We're getting nowhere fast.)
Turnabout samurai,3,189,Maya,"Um, w-we'd really like to ask you about the Steel Samurai!"
Turnabout samurai,3,190,Vasquez,... ...
Turnabout samurai,3,191,Phoenix,Ms. Vasquez?
Turnabout samurai,3,192,Vasquez,It's on TV. Every week. That's all I have to say about that.
Turnabout samurai,3,193,Maya,N-Nick! She's telling us to go watch TV!? The nerve of her!
Turnabout samurai,3,194,Phoenix,"Hey, don't get mad at me."
Turnabout samurai,3,195,Phoenix,"About the director... Sal Manella, was it? What, er, exactly is his role here...?"
Turnabout samurai,3,196,Vasquez,Perhaps I didn't make myself clear? I'm looking for a script. I can't be bothered with anything else. ...
Turnabout samurai,3,197,Maya,Nick? Are all people in the entertainment business this... weird?
Turnabout samurai,3,198,Phoenix,It's starting to look like it.
Turnabout samurai,3,199,Maya,"Nick, let's get out of here. Isn't there someplace else we have to check?"
Turnabout samurai,3,200,Phoenix,Y-yeah.
Turnabout samurai,3,201,Vasquez,Wait.
Turnabout samurai,3,202,Phoenix,Y-yes?
Turnabout samurai,3,203,Vasquez,"If you see Manella, give him this."
Turnabout samurai,3,204,Maya,W-why do we have to do your errands...!
Turnabout samurai,3,205,Vasquez,...
Turnabout samurai,3,206,Maya,...
Turnabout samurai,3,207,Vasquez,...
Turnabout samurai,3,208,Maya,I... I don't think I like her. *sniff*
Turnabout samurai,3,209,Phoenix,Don't cry. She'll take it as a sign of weakness. Alright. We'll give it to him if we see him.
Turnabout samurai,3,210,Phoenix,Here. I got this from the producer...
Turnabout samurai,3,211,Manella,"Huh? ""Bring the script for Episode 13""? Episode 13... where did I put that one? ... I must have left it somewhere... *sweats* U-uh oh... My ass is p0wned if I don't find it... *shakes*"
Turnabout samurai,3,212,Maya,Nick... It might be quicker to just look in all the places where he's likely to have been.
Turnabout samurai,3,213,Phoenix,I agree.
Turnabout samurai,3,214,Maya,"We're back at the scene of the crime. Let's find what we need and get out of here quick, Nick."
Turnabout samurai,3,215,Maya,Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these.
Turnabout samurai,3,216,Phoenix,"(The director...!) Maya... Take a look around that chair for me, would you? Remember that script the director was talking about? Didn't he say he'd left it somewhere?"
Turnabout samurai,3,217,Maya,"Ahah! Found it, Nick! The script!"
Turnabout samurai,3,218,Phoenix,Good work!
Turnabout samurai,3,219,Phoenix,We found your script.
Turnabout samurai,3,220,Manella,"W00t! THX! S-still... I dunno... That woman is to be ph34red when you bring something to her late... Say, um, j00 think j00 d00dz could take it down there for me? THX!"
Turnabout samurai,3,221,Maya,Is that producer really that scary?
Turnabout samurai,3,222,Phoenix,"(Well, she's certainly not NORMAL...)"
Turnabout samurai,3,223,Phoenix,"Here, we found it! Your script!"
Turnabout samurai,3,224,Vasquez,Ah.
Turnabout samurai,3,225,Vasquez,...
Turnabout samurai,3,226,Phoenix,... Umm... uh... You're not going to talk to us?
Turnabout samurai,3,227,Vasquez,Quiet. I'm reading.
Turnabout samurai,3,228,Maya,"...! Just you hold on! What's the big idea!? Who do you think you are anyway!? And, and do you even know who we are!?"
Turnabout samurai,3,229,Vasquez,... Powers's lawyers?
Turnabout samurai,3,230,Maya,Umm.... right.
Turnabout samurai,3,231,Vasquez,Am I a suspect?
Turnabout samurai,3,232,Maya,"N-no, it's just, well, no, but..."
Turnabout samurai,3,233,Vasquez,... You wanted to know about the day of the murder?
Turnabout samurai,3,234,Maya,Y-yes. Anything you could tell us would be a big help.
Turnabout samurai,3,235,Vasquez,... You know there was a meeting here at noon?
Turnabout samurai,3,236,Phoenix,Yes. With the director and the people from the network...
Turnabout samurai,3,237,Vasquez,"Correct. Now, listen closely. None of the people in this trailer that afternoon went to Studio One. It was impossible for us to leave."
Turnabout samurai,3,238,Maya,Impossible? Why?
Turnabout samurai,3,239,Vasquez,The path was blocked.
Turnabout samurai,3,240,Phoenix,The... path?
Turnabout samurai,3,241,Phoenix,"On the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked?"
Turnabout samurai,3,242,Vasquez,"You saw Mr. Monkey on the way here, correct?"
Turnabout samurai,3,243,Phoenix,"M-""Mr. Monkey""?"
Turnabout samurai,3,244,Vasquez,The monkey with the broken head.
Turnabout samurai,3,245,Phoenix,"Oh, right, that... (What an original name...)"
Turnabout samurai,3,246,Vasquez,"Its head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capsice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One."
Turnabout samurai,3,247,Maya,W-what!?
Turnabout samurai,3,248,Vasquez,It's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story.
Turnabout samurai,3,249,Phoenix,B-but wait! What if the head fell over after 2:30? Then you could have gone to Studio One!
Turnabout samurai,3,250,Vasquez,2:30... the time of death. ... Very well. Come.
Turnabout samurai,3,251,Vasquez,"... That's ""Mr. Monkey."" When it wasn't broken, it announced the time... in ""ooks."" One ""ook"" per hour. Ook ook ook ook. Always with the ooking."
Turnabout samurai,3,252,Phoenix,"(It IS a monkey, after all.)"
Turnabout samurai,3,253,Vasquez,Check its head. The clock inside stopped when it broke.
Turnabout samurai,3,254,Maya,"...! Nick, it's stopped at 2:15."
Turnabout samurai,3,255,Phoenix,2:15...?
Turnabout samurai,3,256,Vasquez,"That's right. This path was blocked from 2:15 till after 4:00. Therefore, we're innocent."
Turnabout samurai,3,257,Phoenix,Mr. Hammer died in Studio One at 2:30...
Turnabout samurai,3,258,Vasquez,See? Good bye.
Turnabout samurai,3,259,Maya,"What do we do, Nick? There isn't anyone besides WP who could have killed Hammer! It's over... We're finished!"
Turnabout samurai,3,260,Phoenix,(It sure doesn't look good. Guess we should head back to the office and plan our strategy...)
Turnabout samurai,3,261,Phoenix,Now what... We're fresh out of clues. Everyone's alibi is water-tight. We don't even have any promising leads. Things are looking pretty grim.
Turnabout samurai,3,262,Mia,"It's a little early for giving up, don't you think?"
Turnabout samurai,3,263,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout samurai,3,264,Mia,You've got one lead...
Turnabout samurai,3,265,Phoenix,M-Mia! It's you! What took you so long!?
Turnabout samurai,3,266,Mia,"Sorry, Phoenix. Maya has trouble calling me unless she's really in trouble."
Turnabout samurai,3,267,Phoenix,"Right! Oh, wait. I guess that means we're really in trouble."
Turnabout samurai,3,268,Mia,I'd say so.
Turnabout samurai,3,269,Phoenix,"What did you mean, we have one lead...?"
Turnabout samurai,3,270,Mia,"The boy, of course."
Turnabout samurai,3,271,Cody,"Yeah, I saw 'em. I saw everything!"
Turnabout samurai,3,272,Maya,What!?
Turnabout samurai,3,273,Cody,But...but no way am I telling you losers!
Turnabout samurai,3,274,Phoenix,I dunno. He didn't sound like he was going to help us at all.
Turnabout samurai,3,275,Mia,"I'm sure you can find some way of bringing him over to your side. Either way, we should get back to the studios. That boy is our last hope, Phoenix."
Turnabout samurai,3,276,Phoenix,"(Thanks, now I'm more worried than I was before...)"
Turnabout samurai,3,277,Oldbag,Huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... Huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... puff... huff...
Turnabout samurai,3,278,Phoenix,W-what's wrong?
Turnabout samurai,3,279,Oldbag,Huff... puff... huff... puff... whih... whippersnapper!
Turnabout samurai,3,280,Phoenix,(She's been chasing that boy this whole time.)
Turnabout samurai,3,281,Oldbag,Huff... puff... when... when I ca... catch him... I... huff
Turnabout samurai,3,282,Phoenix,(Sounds like she hasn't had any luck catching him.)
Turnabout samurai,3,283,Oldbag,"Huff... puff... I... I got a hostage now, whippersnapper!"
Turnabout samurai,3,284,Phoenix,"(A ""hostage""...!?)"
Turnabout samurai,3,285,Phoenix,Umm... what happened to the boy?
Turnabout samurai,3,286,Oldbag,"I-if I see him a-again, I'll... huff! L-lay him flat! Huff... puff..."
Turnabout samurai,3,287,Mia,"My, what a violent old lady..."
Turnabout samurai,3,288,Phoenix,"Actually, I met with the director just now..."
Turnabout samurai,3,289,Oldbag,"Eh? Hah... my heart, it don't feel so good."
Turnabout samurai,3,290,Phoenix,(Is she okay!?)
Turnabout samurai,3,291,Oldbag,"B-before I go, I'd like to v-visit the place where poor H-Hammer died..."
Turnabout samurai,3,292,Phoenix,(Right... she was saying she wanted to visit the studio where he died.)
Turnabout samurai,3,293,Phoenix,"What's this about a ""hostage""?"
Turnabout samurai,3,294,Oldbag,"Huff... huff... W-when that boy was running away... ...he dropped this, a-and ran! Huff... huff... H-he'll come back... huff... huff... for this one!"
Turnabout samurai,3,295,Phoenix,(It's kind of hard to understand her with all that huffing and puffing.)
Turnabout samurai,3,296,Mia,"Phoenix! That ""hostage"" might be what we need! Cody might talk to us if we gave him that!"
Turnabout samurai,3,297,Phoenix,(Good idea!) Ms. Oldbag! Might I...
Turnabout samurai,3,298,Oldbag,No! I'm catching that brat if it's the last thing I do!
Turnabout samurai,3,299,Mia,Phoenix. Do you have anything you might trade with her?
Turnabout samurai,3,300,Phoenix,"(A trade, hmm... I wonder...?)"
Turnabout samurai,3,301,Oldbag,H-hey... that... huff... That's a card... huff... Studio One?
Turnabout samurai,3,302,Phoenix,Right. A cardkey to Studio One.
Turnabout samurai,3,303,Oldbag,Huff... puff... I... I could visit poor Hammer... I'd like to visit... huff... he died... whew. I was his... his fan.
Turnabout samurai,3,304,Phoenix,"You don't have your own card, Ms. Oldbag?"
Turnabout samurai,3,305,Oldbag,"Studio One isn't my turf. Huff... huff... You'll let me borrow... borrow it, then?"
Turnabout samurai,3,306,Phoenix,"(If I give her the cardkey, then I won't be able to get into Studio One...!)"
Turnabout samurai,3,307,Mia,"Why don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix?"
Turnabout samurai,3,308,Phoenix,"I guess it can't hurt. Here you go, Ms. Oldbag."
Turnabout samurai,3,309,Oldbag,"... Listen to me, sonny. I don't like having debts to no whippersnappers. You take this, and we're even. Deal?"
Turnabout samurai,3,310,Phoenix,What's this...? A Steel Samurai trading card?
Turnabout samurai,3,311,Oldbag,"That sneaky kid dropped it! I figure it's pretty important to him, though."
Turnabout samurai,3,312,Phoenix,"Thank you, I may have a use for this. (This must be the ""hostage"" she was talking about.)"
Turnabout samurai,3,313,Oldbag,Right. I'm off.
Turnabout samurai,3,314,Phoenix,"(There she goes, hobbling off toward the studio...)"
Turnabout samurai,3,315,Phoenix,"Hey! Hey, you! W-wait a sec!"
Turnabout samurai,3,316,Mia,... Phoenix... Was that the boy?
Turnabout samurai,3,317,Phoenix,"Yeah. His name's ""Cody Hackins."""
Turnabout samurai,3,318,Mia,I think he ran into the dressing room.
Turnabout samurai,3,319,Phoenix,He's sure to be in here somewhere... Found you!
Turnabout samurai,3,320,Cody,...!
Turnabout samurai,3,321,Phoenix,Dammit! He's getting away!
Turnabout samurai,3,322,Mia,Come back! ... There. He's back.
Turnabout samurai,3,323,Phoenix,(How did she...!?)
Turnabout samurai,3,324,Cody,...
Turnabout samurai,3,325,Mia,Hey there. Would you mind helping us out? Please?
Turnabout samurai,3,326,Cody,... I-I'm Cody.
Turnabout samurai,3,327,Mia,"Hello, Cody. I'm Mia. Mia Fey. Nice to meet you."
Turnabout samurai,3,328,Cody,Yo.
Turnabout samurai,3,329,Phoenix,And I'm Phoenix Wright!
Turnabout samurai,3,330,Cody,Who asked?
Turnabout samurai,3,331,Mia,"Phoenix, you can take it from here."
Turnabout samurai,3,332,Phoenix,(I'm not so sure I'm qualified...)
Turnabout samurai,3,333,Phoenix,"The Steel Samurai's so cool. I think he's the, um, the ""bomb."""
Turnabout samurai,3,334,Cody,Hah! What would a lamer like you know about the Steel Samurai!
Turnabout samurai,3,335,Phoenix,"H-hey, watch that attitude!"
Turnabout samurai,3,336,Mia,"Phoenix, you really should't yell like that. He's only a kid."
Turnabout samurai,3,337,Cody,Yeah! Don't yell like that I'm only a kid!
Turnabout samurai,3,338,Phoenix,"So, do you know anything about what happened here? Could you tell me, please?"
Turnabout samurai,3,339,Cody,I don't know nothing!
Turnabout samurai,3,340,Phoenix,(Hmm... looks like a little persuasion's necessary. Maybe a bribe...?)
Turnabout samurai,3,341,Phoenix,Cody... This look familiar?
Turnabout samurai,3,342,Cody,Hey! My UR!
Turnabout samurai,3,343,Phoenix,"""You are""... huh?"
Turnabout samurai,3,344,Cody,"""U.R."" You know, ""ultra rare""! That card's really hard to get! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!"
Turnabout samurai,3,345,Phoenix,I'll give you this... IF you help me.
Turnabout samurai,3,346,Cody,"But that's my card! By offering me something I already own, you're in effect eschewing the very basis of our consumer society, namely the principle of fair trade! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!"
Turnabout samurai,3,347,Phoenix,(W-what do they teach these kids in school these days!? Quantum physics!?)
Turnabout samurai,3,348,Cody,"Whatever, I don't need that card."
Turnabout samurai,3,349,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout samurai,3,350,Cody,I got a double. Just keep it. It's yours.
Turnabout samurai,3,351,Phoenix,(What!? After I went through all that trouble...)
Turnabout samurai,3,352,Cody,"If you want to trade, find me a REALLY rare card!"
Turnabout samurai,3,353,Phoenix,"""Really rare""!? You mean there's something rarer than ""Ultra Rare""!?"
Turnabout samurai,3,354,Cody,"Ultra Rare Premium cards are way rarer than plain Ultra Rare cards! Come ON! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!"
Turnabout samurai,3,355,Phoenix,Premium... rare... why do I feel like we're talking about steaks?
Turnabout samurai,3,356,Penny,"Oh, hi."
Turnabout samurai,3,357,Phoenix,Hello. What brings you here?
Turnabout samurai,3,358,Penny,"Oh, well, I had to arrange some stuff... Umm..."
Turnabout samurai,3,359,Phoenix,Yes?
Turnabout samurai,3,360,Penny,"The, um, girl with you. Doesn't she seem a little different? Like, is she even the same person as before?"
Turnabout samurai,3,361,Phoenix,"Um, nope! She's the same as always."
Turnabout samurai,3,362,Mia,Same as always.
Turnabout samurai,3,363,Penny,Okay... whatever you say...
Turnabout samurai,3,364,Phoenix,Have you seen that boy since then?
Turnabout samurai,3,365,Penny,"Nope. You missed it, though. The security lady was chasing around after the boy so fast I thought she'd collapse. Of course, he got away in the end. Boy, was she mad!"
Turnabout samurai,3,366,Phoenix,"Actually, we saw them. How's the old windbag doing?"
Turnabout samurai,3,367,Penny,She was squeezing donuts through her clenched fists back at the guard station.
Turnabout samurai,3,368,Phoenix,(Some people take their jobs a little too seriously.)
Turnabout samurai,3,369,Phoenix,Are all the posters on the wall here of Hammer?
Turnabout samurai,3,370,Penny,Yes. It's really a terrible loss for the studios.
Turnabout samurai,3,371,Phoenix,"But... his popularity had been waning recently, right?"
Turnabout samurai,3,372,Penny,"That's true. Then again, after what happened..."
Turnabout samurai,3,373,Phoenix,After WHAT happened?
Turnabout samurai,3,374,Penny,"Y-you mean, you don't know about Hammer...?"
Turnabout samurai,3,375,Phoenix,"No, what?"
Turnabout samurai,3,376,Penny,I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything.
Turnabout samurai,3,377,Phoenix,"Wait, now you have to tell me. What happened with Hammer?"
Turnabout samurai,3,378,Penny,I-I'm sorry. I'm probably not the one who should tell you.
Turnabout samurai,3,379,Phoenix,(Uh oh. Why do I get the feeling something's being covered up here?)
Turnabout samurai,3,380,Phoenix,Do you know anything about this?
Turnabout samurai,3,381,Penny,"Hey, that's a Steel Samurai trading card. I collect those, actually. I'm one card away from a complete set!"
Turnabout samurai,3,382,Phoenix,A complete set?
Turnabout samurai,3,383,Penny,"Yeah, a set of one of each card."
Turnabout samurai,3,384,Phoenix,Huh...
Turnabout samurai,3,385,Penny,... Wait...Waitwaitwaitwait!!! That's it!!! That's the card I need! You don't know how long I've been looking for it!
Turnabout samurai,3,386,Phoenix,Uh...
Turnabout samurai,3,387,Penny,"I don't care what kind of girl you might think I am, I need that card! P-please! I beg you! Please trade with me!"
Turnabout samurai,3,388,Phoenix,T-trade with you?
Turnabout samurai,3,389,Penny,"Yes, trade cards! Look, I'll even trade you an Ultra Rare Premium card!"
Turnabout samurai,3,390,Phoenix,Trade me a... huh?
Turnabout samurai,3,391,Penny,"Yes, it's a good deal for your Ultra Rare! Please!!!"
Turnabout samurai,3,392,Mia,Phoenix! Can't you see she's desperate?
Turnabout samurai,3,393,Phoenix,(W-what's everybody getting so excited about...?)
Turnabout samurai,3,394,Phoenix,Okay.
Turnabout samurai,3,395,Penny,Really!? Th-thanks!!! Then this is for you.
Turnabout samurai,3,396,Penny,Yaa-hoo!
Turnabout samurai,3,397,Phoenix,(And there she goes...)
Turnabout samurai,3,398,Mia,Doesn't doing good things like that make you feel great?
Turnabout samurai,3,399,Phoenix,"Yeah. Yeah, it does."
Turnabout samurai,3,400,Phoenix,See this card?
Turnabout samurai,3,401,Cody,"Yeah, so... Wait! That's it!!! That's the last Ultra Rare Premium card I need! C'mon give it to me, please! You gotta give it to me!"
Turnabout samurai,3,402,Phoenix,"(Wow, I've never seen him so... eager.) R-right! Okay! How about a trade?"
Turnabout samurai,3,403,Cody,"You're on! I'll give you a ""Samurai Spear"" and throw in an ""Evil Magistrate"" to boot!!"
Turnabout samurai,3,404,Phoenix,No no no no... not that kind of trade. I don't want cards. I want information.
Turnabout samurai,3,405,Cody,Huh? You sure? Fine by me!
Turnabout samurai,3,406,Mia,"Okay, Phoenix. Let's hear what he has to say. If he knows something that could help us, we can have him take the stand tomorrow."
Turnabout samurai,3,407,Phoenix,So... you like the Steel Samurai.
Turnabout samurai,3,408,Cody,He's so cool!
Turnabout samurai,3,409,Phoenix,I... I guess.
Turnabout samurai,3,410,Cody,"You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life!"
Turnabout samurai,3,411,Phoenix,(I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...)
Turnabout samurai,3,412,Cody,"You like him too, don'tcha?"
Turnabout samurai,3,413,Phoenix,"Uh... Oh, me? Y-yeah! I, um, love the Steel Samurai."
Turnabout samurai,3,414,Cody,"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!"
Turnabout samurai,3,415,Phoenix,"(Got to think of something...) I like it when he, uh, he vanquishes his foes!"
Turnabout samurai,3,416,Cody,Yeah! Whizzam! The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Check this out! It's my fan album!
Turnabout samurai,3,417,Phoenix,What the...? It's all pictures of the Steel Samurai.
Turnabout samurai,3,418,Cody,I go to every live performance!
Turnabout samurai,3,419,Phoenix,(Those stupid publicity stunts where they beat each other up in public...?)
Turnabout samurai,3,420,Cody,I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection! Check it out! My new digital camera!
Turnabout samurai,3,421,Mia,"Wow, that's very impressive. The newest model, isn't it?"
Turnabout samurai,3,422,Cody,"You bet, lady! I just got it for my birthday. My album has a name, wanna hear it? ""The Steel Samurai: Path To Glory."" The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Hey, if you want this, you can have it, lady."
Turnabout samurai,3,423,Mia,Really? Are you sure?
Turnabout samurai,3,424,Cody,"Yeah, I took these with a digital camera. I got all the data at home so I can always make another one."
Turnabout samurai,3,425,Mia,"Well, then I'm happy to accept! Thank you."
Turnabout samurai,3,426,Phoenix,(What's with people always giving stuff to Mia? What a life!)
Turnabout samurai,3,427,Mia,?
Turnabout samurai,3,428,Phoenix,"You were here on the day of the... incident, right?"
Turnabout samurai,3,429,Cody,Yeah...
Turnabout samurai,3,430,Phoenix,Did you see anything unusual?
Turnabout samurai,3,431,Cody,...
Turnabout samurai,3,432,Mia,Cody.
Turnabout samurai,3,433,Cody,!
Turnabout samurai,3,434,Mia,"Cody, he needs to know because he's fighting for justice. Isn't that the Steel Samurai's motto? ""For great justice""? You have to help us fight for great justice, too."
Turnabout samurai,3,435,Cody,I... I saw... I saw everything!
Turnabout samurai,3,436,Phoenix,"(Well, well... We might get some useful information out of him yet.)"
Turnabout samurai,3,437,Phoenix,Cody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident?
Turnabout samurai,3,438,Cody,"... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that..."
Turnabout samurai,3,439,Mia,"What is it, Cody?"
Turnabout samurai,3,440,Cody,"Th-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that."
Turnabout samurai,3,441,Phoenix,I... I see. It must have been hard for you.
Turnabout samurai,3,442,Cody,"Man, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart."
Turnabout samurai,3,443,Phoenix,(Umm... right.) Mia?
Turnabout samurai,3,444,Mia,Yes?
Turnabout samurai,3,445,Phoenix,I think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.
Turnabout samurai,3,446,Mia,True enough.
Turnabout samurai,3,447,Phoenix,"And the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him."
Turnabout samurai,3,448,Mia,Indeed.
Turnabout samurai,3,449,Phoenix,So... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers!
Turnabout samurai,3,450,Mia,"... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be ""guilty"" for sure."
Turnabout samurai,3,451,Phoenix,Let's not call him then...
Turnabout samurai,3,452,Mia,I think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone.
Turnabout samurai,3,453,Gumshoe,"Not so fast, pal!"
Turnabout samurai,3,454,Gumshoe,"I heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct!"
Turnabout samurai,3,455,Cody,No! I ain't going! Waah!
Turnabout samurai,3,456,Mia,... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court.
Turnabout samurai,3,457,Phoenix,"W-what're we going to do, Mia!"
Turnabout samurai,3,458,Mia,"Well, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine!"
Turnabout samurai,3,459,Phoenix,"Whoa whoa whoa! C-come to the trial tomorrow, please! I need you there!"
Turnabout samurai,3,460,Mia,"Phoenix, can I ask you something? Do you really believe that Mr. Powers is innocent?"
Turnabout samurai,3,461,Phoenix,Of course he is!
Turnabout samurai,3,462,Mia,"... That's all I wanted to hear. Excellent. I'll see you in court, then."
Turnabout samurai,3,463,Phoenix,"Great! Thanks, Mia!"
Turnabout samurai,3,464,Mia,See you soon.
Turnabout samurai,4,0,Will,... ... Umm... Mr. Wright?
Turnabout samurai,4,1,Phoenix,Yes?
Turnabout samurai,4,2,Will,Why do you look so... unhappy?
Turnabout samurai,4,3,Phoenix,"O-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)"
Turnabout samurai,4,4,Mia,Phoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.
Turnabout samurai,4,5,Phoenix,"This is no time for dead-people jokes, please."
Turnabout samurai,4,6,Mia,"You know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it."
Turnabout samurai,4,7,Phoenix,"Something ""overlooked""...?"
Turnabout samurai,4,8,Mia,"We have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial."
Turnabout samurai,4,9,Phoenix,(This isn't going to be easy.)
Turnabout samurai,4,10,Judge,The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.
Turnabout samurai,4,11,Edgeworth,"The prosecution is ready, Your Honor."
Turnabout samurai,4,12,Phoenix,"The defense is ready, Your Honor."
Turnabout samurai,4,13,Judge,"Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please."
Turnabout samurai,4,14,Edgeworth,"An unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios! Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder."
Turnabout samurai,4,15,Judge,"Very well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth."
Turnabout samurai,4,16,Phoenix,(I wonder if that producer is going to come out...)
Turnabout samurai,4,17,Edgeworth,The prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.
Turnabout samurai,4,18,Phoenix,(... or that director.)
Turnabout samurai,4,19,Edgeworth,Will the witness state his name and profession?
Turnabout samurai,4,20,Manella,"... How r00d can j00 get! J00 don't know ME!? I'm the director! I make the Steel Samurai, n00b! ROFL!"
Turnabout samurai,4,21,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout samurai,4,22,Manella,S... Sal Manella. I'm a director. Television.
Turnabout samurai,4,23,Judge,Were you at Global Studios on the day of the murder?
Turnabout samurai,4,24,Manella,"Y-yes, Your Honor."
Turnabout samurai,4,25,Judge,Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day.
Turnabout samurai,4,26,Mia,"Phoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!"
Turnabout samurai,4,27,Phoenix,R-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)
Turnabout samurai,4,28,Manella,I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.
Turnabout samurai,4,29,Phoenix,Is that when you always come in to work?
Turnabout samurai,4,30,Manella,"Oh, oh no. I come in all sort of hours. It's the ""industry"" way."
Turnabout samurai,4,31,Phoenix,"(Yeah, I know all about the freaks in your ""industry""...)"
Turnabout samurai,4,32,Manella,"Still, FWIW, I was pretty busy all that day. :("
Turnabout samurai,4,33,Edgeworth,Tell us more about that.
Turnabout samurai,4,34,Manella,"During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through."
Turnabout samurai,4,35,Phoenix,In the Employee Area?
Turnabout samurai,4,36,Manella,That's right. It was a fight scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate.
Turnabout samurai,4,37,Phoenix,Was anyone else at the run-through?
Turnabout samurai,4,38,Manella,"Oh, yeah. That security lady was sitting there watching the whole thing. LOL. She was cheering on Hammer, if you can believe it."
Turnabout samurai,4,39,Phoenix,(She certainly has the lungs for it...) Anyone else?
Turnabout samurai,4,40,Manella,"Nope, just us four."
Turnabout samurai,4,41,Manella,It took a lot more time than I thought it would.
Turnabout samurai,4,42,Phoenix,Why did it go on so long?
Turnabout samurai,4,43,Manella,"Um, I'm pretty sure j00've already heard about this... But WP twisted his ankle during the run-through, see..."
Turnabout samurai,4,44,Phoenix,"(Oh, right, thus the limp.)"
Turnabout samurai,4,45,Manella,Which of course led to me missing my lunch. ROFS!
Turnabout samurai,4,46,Phoenix,(ROFS? Rolling on the Floor... Starving?)
Turnabout samurai,4,47,Manella,I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...
Turnabout samurai,4,48,Phoenix,What exactly did they have for lunch?
Turnabout samurai,4,49,Manella,T-bone steak! The assistant cooked some up.
Turnabout samurai,4,50,Phoenix,"(Come to think of it, there was a plate with some bones on it in the Employee Area.)"
Turnabout samurai,4,51,Edgeworth,"""Everyone else"" meaning that the witness did not eat with them."
Turnabout samurai,4,52,Manella,"But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch."
Turnabout samurai,4,53,Phoenix,"So, in the end, you didn't get to eat?"
Turnabout samurai,4,54,Manella,"Yeah. No steak, at least! Can j00 believe it?"
Turnabout samurai,4,55,Phoenix,That must have been tough.
Turnabout samurai,4,56,Mia,Phoenix.
Turnabout samurai,4,57,Phoenix,Yeah?
Turnabout samurai,4,58,Mia,Doesn't something about that seem odd to you?
Turnabout samurai,4,59,Phoenix,"Yeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella!"
Turnabout samurai,4,60,Manella,H-hmm? W-what do j00 mean? *sweats*
Turnabout samurai,4,61,Phoenix,"When I went to that trailer, I saw something on the table. There were two plates on the table--the same kind of plates as in the Employee Area. Who ate lunch there?"
Turnabout samurai,4,62,Manella,"M-mmpf! No, er, ah, um, eh heh. Good call! *sweats* I, er, I was embarrassed so I didn't mention it... But I did eat, after all."
Turnabout samurai,4,63,Phoenix,"A t-bone steak, you mean?"
Turnabout samurai,4,64,Manella,"Yeah, well, I mean the assistant went through all that trouble... I brought it to the trailer thinking I could eat it later."
Turnabout samurai,4,65,Phoenix,"(Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it?"
Turnabout samurai,4,66,Manella,"We took one break during that meeting. I, er, wolfed it down then. *drool*"
Turnabout samurai,4,67,Phoenix,"(A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...)"
Turnabout samurai,4,68,Manella,We were in the meeting until around 4:00...
Turnabout samurai,4,69,Phoenix,What were you discussing?
Turnabout samurai,4,70,Manella,"The Steel Samurai story, and our budget. Get this! The sponsors turn to me and say, ""Mr. Manella. Those scripts of yours are not appropriate for children."" Can j00 believe it!?"
Turnabout samurai,4,71,Phoenix,"(Actually, I kind of can.) So, nobody left the table during the whole meeting?"
Turnabout samurai,4,72,Manella,"During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs."
Turnabout samurai,4,73,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,74,Phoenix,You didn't take a single break?
Turnabout samurai,4,75,Manella,Er... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*
Turnabout samurai,4,76,Phoenix,"(Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea... Wait a second... Maybe I do have an idea!)"
Turnabout samurai,4,77,Phoenix,"Wait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break?"
Turnabout samurai,4,78,Manella,Oops! ROFL!
Turnabout samurai,4,79,Phoenix,Well?
Turnabout samurai,4,80,Manella,Umm...
Turnabout samurai,4,81,Judge,"Mr. Manella, what's this all about?"
Turnabout samurai,4,82,Manella,"W-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break."
Turnabout samurai,4,83,Mia,"Phoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time!"
Turnabout samurai,4,84,Phoenix,Your Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break!
Turnabout samurai,4,85,Judge,"Very well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please."
Turnabout samurai,4,86,Manella,Urk!
Turnabout samurai,4,87,Edgeworth,Heh heh heh...
Turnabout samurai,4,88,Phoenix,(Uh oh. Edgeworth is laughing...)
Turnabout samurai,4,89,Manella,"Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!"
Turnabout samurai,4,90,Phoenix,What time exactly did you take this break?
Turnabout samurai,4,91,Manella,Hmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so untl 2:45.
Turnabout samurai,4,92,Phoenix,"(2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...)"
Turnabout samurai,4,93,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout samurai,4,94,Manella,But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!
Turnabout samurai,4,95,Phoenix,What were you doing for those 15 minutes?
Turnabout samurai,4,96,Manella,Eating my t-bone steak! What else!?
Turnabout samurai,4,97,Phoenix,There were two plates on the trailer table...?
Turnabout samurai,4,98,Manella,"Oh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate."
Turnabout samurai,4,99,Phoenix,(Dee Vasquez... the producer.)
Turnabout samurai,4,100,Edgeworth,To eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.
Turnabout samurai,4,101,Manella,"Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!"
Turnabout samurai,4,102,Phoenix,Why is that?
Turnabout samurai,4,103,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,104,Edgeworth,Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!
Turnabout samurai,4,105,Phoenix,What!?
Turnabout samurai,4,106,Edgeworth,"Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!"
Turnabout samurai,4,107,Judge,"Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout samurai,4,108,Mia,"Phoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!"
Turnabout samurai,4,109,Judge,Do you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?
Turnabout samurai,4,110,Phoenix,"(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time."
Turnabout samurai,4,111,Edgeworth,Ha hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.
Turnabout samurai,4,112,Judge,"What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?"
Turnabout samurai,4,113,Edgeworth,"It's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!"
Turnabout samurai,4,114,Phoenix,"... (It's actually ""Mr. Monkey,"" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)"
Turnabout samurai,4,115,Edgeworth,I believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.
Turnabout samurai,4,116,Phoenix,(Wh-what? It's over?)
Turnabout samurai,4,117,Judge,"Very well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty."
Turnabout samurai,4,118,Edgeworth,Your Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.
Turnabout samurai,4,119,Judge,"Who is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?"
Turnabout samurai,4,120,Edgeworth,My witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!
Turnabout samurai,4,121,Judge,"Order! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!"
Turnabout samurai,4,122,Mia,...
Turnabout samurai,4,123,Phoenix,"What do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi..."
Turnabout samurai,4,124,Mia,"... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong."
Turnabout samurai,4,125,Phoenix,"M-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?"
Turnabout samurai,4,126,Mia,"... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is."
Turnabout samurai,4,127,Will,Umm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!
Turnabout samurai,4,128,Mia,"Don't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all."
Turnabout samurai,4,129,Will,I... You... Thanks. *sniff*
Turnabout samurai,4,130,Mia,"Okay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!"
Turnabout samurai,4,131,Judge,Court is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.
Turnabout samurai,4,132,Edgeworth,"The prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!"
Turnabout samurai,4,133,Phoenix,(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)
Turnabout samurai,4,134,Edgeworth,"However, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand."
Turnabout samurai,4,135,Edgeworth,Your Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?
Turnabout samurai,4,136,Judge,"Oh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do."
Turnabout samurai,4,137,Edgeworth,Will the witness state his name and grade in school.
Turnabout samurai,4,138,Cody,...
Turnabout samurai,4,139,Edgeworth,Witness!
Turnabout samurai,4,140,Cody,What!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around!
Turnabout samurai,4,141,Edgeworth,Mrph...
Turnabout samurai,4,142,Mia,"Cody? Answer his question, okay?"
Turnabout samurai,4,143,Cody,"H-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade!"
Turnabout samurai,4,144,Phoenix,"(I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...)"
Turnabout samurai,4,145,Judge,Mr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle.
Turnabout samurai,4,146,Edgeworth,"M-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody."
Turnabout samurai,4,147,Phoenix,"(He's having trouble with this ""gentle"" thing.)"
Turnabout samurai,4,148,Edgeworth,"You were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident?"
Turnabout samurai,4,149,Cody,You got a problem with that!?
Turnabout samurai,4,150,Edgeworth,Please tell us what you saw that day.
Turnabout samurai,4,151,Cody,"What, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there?"
Turnabout samurai,4,152,Edgeworth,Just.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine.
Turnabout samurai,4,153,Judge,"I prefer ""bearded gentleman"" myself."
Turnabout samurai,4,154,Phoenix,(A very long day...)
Turnabout samurai,4,155,Judge,"Incidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom."
Turnabout samurai,4,156,Edgeworth,"M-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible."
Turnabout samurai,4,157,Phoenix,"Wait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST?"
Turnabout samurai,4,158,Cody,Hey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!
Turnabout samurai,4,159,Mia,Phoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.
Turnabout samurai,4,160,Judge,"Very well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident."
Turnabout samurai,4,161,Cody,"Anyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home."
Turnabout samurai,4,162,Judge,"Hmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child."
Turnabout samurai,4,163,Cody,...
Turnabout samurai,4,164,Phoenix,"(This kid is tougher than most adults we see in here, honestly...)"
Turnabout samurai,4,165,Cody,"I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once."
Turnabout samurai,4,166,Phoenix,"You really like the Steel Samurai, huh?"
Turnabout samurai,4,167,Cody,Course I do! I've taped every show! And I go to all the live performances!
Turnabout samurai,4,168,Phoenix,That's impressive. Have you been to the amusement park?
Turnabout samurai,4,169,Cody,Course! Duh! My Dad always takes me!
Turnabout samurai,4,170,Phoenix,"(Poor, poor Dad...)"
Turnabout samurai,4,171,Cody,"I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day."
Turnabout samurai,4,172,Phoenix,Was that day the first time you'd been to the studio?
Turnabout samurai,4,173,Cody,"Uh, actually I've been a couple of times. I never manage to get there on a rehearsal day! And that security lady's always yelling..."
Turnabout samurai,4,174,Edgeworth,"Right, right. Please continue."
Turnabout samurai,4,175,Cody,"Chill, pops! I'm getting to it! How am I supposed to talk with you cuttin' me off all the time? Geez!"
Turnabout samurai,4,176,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout samurai,4,177,Cody,"I went through the woods, off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me."
Turnabout samurai,4,178,Phoenix,"""Off the path""...?"
Turnabout samurai,4,179,Cody,"Yeah, you know how the studios are in a valley there? If you go off the path a little, there's woods. That's where I was!"
Turnabout samurai,4,180,Phoenix,I see.
Turnabout samurai,4,181,Cody,Anyhow...
Turnabout samurai,4,182,Cody,I was going for the studio.
Turnabout samurai,4,183,Phoenix,Did nothing unusual happen on your way to the studio?
Turnabout samurai,4,184,Cody,"""Unusual""?"
Turnabout samurai,4,185,Phoenix,Did you see this monkey by any chance?
Turnabout samurai,4,186,Cody,"Oh, you mean Mr. Monkey? Yeah I saw him, but his head wasn't busted!"
Turnabout samurai,4,187,Edgeworth,So you went straight to the studio?
Turnabout samurai,4,188,Cody,"I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes."
Turnabout samurai,4,189,Phoenix,You got lost in the woods?
Turnabout samurai,4,190,Cody,"Yeah. I couldn't figure out which way I was walking. Man, was I relieved when I saw the blue studio doors. But guess what happened next!"
Turnabout samurai,4,191,Cody,"When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!"
Turnabout samurai,4,192,Phoenix,The Steel Samurai?
Turnabout samurai,4,193,Cody,"Yeah, he was standing by the studio gate. It looked like he was thinking about something before going in. Then he opened up the gate and went inside."
Turnabout samurai,4,194,Phoenix,I see. What then?
Turnabout samurai,4,195,Cody,"It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!"
Turnabout samurai,4,196,Phoenix,"What sort of ""bad guy"" was it?"
Turnabout samurai,4,197,Cody,A guy. A person. Kinda tall. Skinny.
Turnabout samurai,4,198,Phoenix,Are you sure it was a guy?
Turnabout samurai,4,199,Cody,... I dunno. He was kinda far away.
Turnabout samurai,4,200,Phoenix,"(Huh, he's being awfully vague...)"
Turnabout samurai,4,201,Mia,...
Turnabout samurai,4,202,Cody,"Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!"
Turnabout samurai,4,203,Phoenix,What happened to the bad guy?
Turnabout samurai,4,204,Cody,"Huh? Well... Well, he kinda didn't move. Not a bit. Like he was dead. I-I guess he's a real pro! What a great actor!"
Turnabout samurai,4,205,Phoenix,"Y-yes, I suppose he was."
Turnabout samurai,4,206,Cody,"If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you."
Turnabout samurai,4,207,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,208,Phoenix,"""If"" you had your camera? You mean, you weren't carrying your camera then?"
Turnabout samurai,4,209,Cody,"N-no, I wasn't. I-it's not like I have it all the time!"
Turnabout samurai,4,210,Phoenix,(Really...?)
Turnabout samurai,4,211,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,212,Phoenix,"Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange. Didn't you say before that you always bring your digital camera wherever you go? You were quite clear about that."
Turnabout samurai,4,213,Cody,Huh!?
Turnabout samurai,4,214,Phoenix,"Cody, you shouldn't lie here. You understand that, right?"
Turnabout samurai,4,215,Judge,Mr. Wright! A word with you...
Turnabout samurai,4,216,Phoenix,(Uh oh... was I putting the pressure on too much?)
Turnabout samurai,4,217,Judge,"What is this ""digital"" camera contraption you're talking about?"
Turnabout samurai,4,218,Phoenix,"It's umm... a digital camera, Your Honor. It's kind of a new sort of camera. (How do I explain that!?)"
Turnabout samurai,4,219,Judge,I see.
Turnabout samurai,4,220,Phoenix,"Anyway, Cody... I can't believe you wouldn't bring your camera on a trip to the studios! You did bring it, didn't you?"
Turnabout samurai,4,221,Cody,Umm...
Turnabout samurai,4,222,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,223,Edgeworth,"Mr. Wright! How cruel you are, to terrorize a poor child so!"
Turnabout samurai,4,224,Phoenix,I don't care if he's a child or a prosecuting attorney! No one should lie in court!
Turnabout samurai,4,225,Edgeworth,"What do you mean ""or a prosecuting attorney""!?"
Turnabout samurai,4,226,Phoenix,"Well, Cody?"
Turnabout samurai,4,227,Cody,"Wh-what! Yeah, so I had my camera. So what!? You got a problem with that!?"
Turnabout samurai,4,228,Judge,"So, you did have a camera? And did you use this camera?"
Turnabout samurai,4,229,Cody,W-why would I use it? I... I was too busy watching.
Turnabout samurai,4,230,Judge,Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about what you were so busy watching.
Turnabout samurai,4,231,Cody,"Y-yeah, I had my camera with me."
Turnabout samurai,4,232,Phoenix,"So, why didn't you use it?"
Turnabout samurai,4,233,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,234,Edgeworth,He's getting to that! Relax and listen.
Turnabout samurai,4,235,Cody,Umm... I didn't use it 'cause I was too busy watching the real thing!
Turnabout samurai,4,236,Cody,But I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it!
Turnabout samurai,4,237,Phoenix,So you were watching the Steel Samurai. Did you watch the whole fight?
Turnabout samurai,4,238,Cody,"Y-yeah, of course!"
Turnabout samurai,4,239,Phoenix,"You didn't turn away, not even once?"
Turnabout samurai,4,240,Cody,N... no!
Turnabout samurai,4,241,Phoenix,"Okay, then tell us exactly what happened."
Turnabout samurai,4,242,Cody,Y-yeah! I'm getting to that!
Turnabout samurai,4,243,Cody,"The Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham!"
Turnabout samurai,4,244,Phoenix,So the bad guy attacked him first?
Turnabout samurai,4,245,Cody,Yeah!
Turnabout samurai,4,246,Phoenix,"What sort of person was this ""bad guy""?"
Turnabout samurai,4,247,Cody,"I told you, a person. He was a person."
Turnabout samurai,4,248,Phoenix,How was he dressed?
Turnabout samurai,4,249,Cody,... I kinda don't remember. I was too busy watching the Steel Samurai!
Turnabout samurai,4,250,Edgeworth,I see. And what happened next?
Turnabout samurai,4,251,Cody,Then... then the bad guy stopped moving!
Turnabout samurai,4,252,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,253,Phoenix,Why?
Turnabout samurai,4,254,Cody,"Huh? Whaddya mean, ""why""?"
Turnabout samurai,4,255,Phoenix,Why wasn't the bad guy moving?
Turnabout samurai,4,256,Cody,W-well 'cause the Steel Samurai brought him to justice!
Turnabout samurai,4,257,Phoenix,And how exactly did he do that?
Turnabout samurai,4,258,Cody,H-how did he do it? With a Samurai Kick! And a Samurai Punch! Samurai Chop! ... Samurai Slap! S-something like that.
Turnabout samurai,4,259,Phoenix,(He's still being vague about this...)
Turnabout samurai,4,260,Cody,"What! Don't give me that look, pops!"
Turnabout samurai,4,261,Phoenix,(How should I play this?)
Turnabout samurai,4,262,Phoenix,Cody.
Turnabout samurai,4,263,Cody,Wh-what!?
Turnabout samurai,4,264,Phoenix,"Something's bothering me. Before you said that you ""couldn't take your eyes off"" the action."
Turnabout samurai,4,265,Cody,Y-yeah? So what?
Turnabout samurai,4,266,Phoenix,Yet you missed the most important part!
Turnabout samurai,4,267,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,268,Edgeworth,What is the meaning of this? The witness has stated what he saw quite clearly...
Turnabout samurai,4,269,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,270,Phoenix,"You know as well as I do that he's being vague! Tell me, what kind of murderer uses a ""Samurai Slap""!?"
Turnabout samurai,4,271,Edgeworth,M-mmph!
Turnabout samurai,4,272,Phoenix,"My point is this: Cody, you may have seen some of the Steel Samurai's fight... But you missed the most important part: the killing blow!"
Turnabout samurai,4,273,Judge,Order! Order! Mr. Wright! How could this be? Can you explain how he might have missed something so vital?
Turnabout samurai,4,274,Phoenix,"Um, well... er, that's the thing..."
Turnabout samurai,4,275,Mia,Phoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out!
Turnabout samurai,4,276,Judge,"Mr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight?"
Turnabout samurai,4,277,Phoenix,"Your Honor, I have evidence."
Turnabout samurai,4,278,Judge,"""Evidence""...?"
Turnabout samurai,4,279,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor. Why did Cody look away from the fight?"
Turnabout samurai,4,280,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,281,Phoenix,Here's my proof!
Turnabout samurai,4,282,Judge,What's that? The camera...?
Turnabout samurai,4,283,Phoenix,The witness stated that he recently received this camera.
Turnabout samurai,4,284,Judge,"Yes, I'm aware of that."
Turnabout samurai,4,285,Phoenix,He wasn't entirely familiar with its operation.
Turnabout samurai,4,286,Judge,"I'm aware of that, too. Ah!"
Turnabout samurai,4,287,Phoenix,Correct! Why would Cody be looking somewhere else at the critical moment? Because he was looking at his camera! He was trying to take a picture!
Turnabout samurai,4,288,Cody,Hey!
Turnabout samurai,4,289,Phoenix,Bullseye!
Turnabout samurai,4,290,Cody,"W-what's your problem, pops! You got a thing for picking on little kids!?"
Turnabout samurai,4,291,Phoenix,"(Pressing, not picking...)"
Turnabout samurai,4,292,Mia,"Good job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!"
Turnabout samurai,4,293,Phoenix,"Right! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?"
Turnabout samurai,4,294,Cody,... ... ... Yeah.
Turnabout samurai,4,295,Mia,"Well, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!"
Turnabout samurai,4,296,Phoenix,R-right. (Mia means business!) Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more.
Turnabout samurai,4,297,Judge,V-very well. Cody? Could you please tell us about your camera... And about why you didn't take a picture of the fight?
Turnabout samurai,4,298,Cody,Umm...
Turnabout samurai,4,299,Phoenix,"(Welcome to the real world, kid!)"
Turnabout samurai,4,300,Cody,"Yeah, you're right, pops."
Turnabout samurai,4,301,Phoenix,"""Pops""...?"
Turnabout samurai,4,302,Cody,"Yeah, I called you ""pops,"" you spiky-haired geezer!"
Turnabout samurai,4,303,Phoenix,G-geezer...?
Turnabout samurai,4,304,Edgeworth,"I'm ""Mr. Edgeworth."""
Turnabout samurai,4,305,Judge,"And I guess I'm the ""bearded gentleman""..."
Turnabout samurai,4,306,Cody,That's what I hate about grown-ups. You're all so self-conscious!
Turnabout samurai,4,307,Phoenix,"Okay, off with the kid gloves! Testify, witness, testify!"
Turnabout samurai,4,308,Cody,Yipes!
Turnabout samurai,4,309,Cody,The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.
Turnabout samurai,4,310,Phoenix,So you did see the beginning of the fight?
Turnabout samurai,4,311,Cody,Yeah.
Turnabout samurai,4,312,Phoenix,Did you notice anything unusual?
Turnabout samurai,4,313,Cody,Umm... well... uh... I guess the Steel Samurai was moving a little strange...
Turnabout samurai,4,314,Phoenix,(Moving... strangely?)
Turnabout samurai,4,315,Cody,So I held up my camera to take a picture!
Turnabout samurai,4,316,Phoenix,Why couldn't you take a picture?
Turnabout samurai,4,317,Cody,"My new camera has too many buttons. I couldn't figure it out. I tried to take a picture, I really tried."
Turnabout samurai,4,318,Cody,"But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it."
Turnabout samurai,4,319,Phoenix,"When the lens opened, what did you see?"
Turnabout samurai,4,320,Cody,"Uh... well, a person on the ground. And the Steel Samurai!"
Turnabout samurai,4,321,Cody,Th-that's all that happened. Yup.
Turnabout samurai,4,322,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,323,Phoenix,That's all?
Turnabout samurai,4,324,Cody,"Y-yeah! I told you, I didn't take a picture!"
Turnabout samurai,4,325,Phoenix,"(Hmm... I would have, once I got that lens open... Did he really not take a picture? Not even one?)"
Turnabout samurai,4,326,Phoenix,"(Nah, he definitely would have taken a picture. There's got to be something here I can use!) Cody! Listen up, Cody Hackins. I know exactly what happened that day. You took a picture!"
Turnabout samurai,4,327,Cody,... Hey!
Turnabout samurai,4,328,Phoenix,(Bullseye...?)
Turnabout samurai,4,329,Cody,H-how did you know!?
Turnabout samurai,4,330,Phoenix,I see through all your lies Cody Hackins. It's one of my powers!
Turnabout samurai,4,331,Cody,W-wow!
Turnabout samurai,4,332,Phoenix,(This feels great!)
Turnabout samurai,4,333,Cody,"Y-yeah... Yeah, I took a picture."
Turnabout samurai,4,334,Judge,"Perhaps you can change your testimony to reflect this, Cody?"
Turnabout samurai,4,335,Cody,"I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em."
Turnabout samurai,4,336,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,337,Phoenix,"You ""erased"" them?"
Turnabout samurai,4,338,Cody,Y-yeah!
Turnabout samurai,4,339,Phoenix,"Why would you erase a picture of your beloved Steel Samurai, victorious?"
Turnabout samurai,4,340,Cody,Well... y'know. W-why would I want to keep a picture like that?
Turnabout samurai,4,341,Phoenix,(Hmm... he's becoming less and less cooperative. I better find a clear contradiction soon... or some solid evidence.)
Turnabout samurai,4,342,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,343,Phoenix,Cody!
Turnabout samurai,4,344,Cody,"Wh-wh-what!? Man, every time you say ""Cody"" you follow it with something bad."
Turnabout samurai,4,345,Phoenix,I just wanted to thank you for giving me this the other day.
Turnabout samurai,4,346,Cody,Huh? O-oh... right.
Turnabout samurai,4,347,Phoenix,What was it you told me then?
Turnabout samurai,4,348,Cody,I go to every live performance! I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection!
Turnabout samurai,4,349,Phoenix,"Cody. Did you really get a picture of the Steel Samurai standing victorious over his foe? If you did, I find it hard to believe that you would just erase it! Wouldn't you keep it for your album?"
Turnabout samurai,4,350,Cody,Ah!
Turnabout samurai,4,351,Judge,Mr. Wright... What exactly is this album?
Turnabout samurai,4,352,Phoenix,"It's called ""Path to Glory."" It's a collection of pictures of the Steel Samurai, all taken by Cody Hackins. He claims it's a perfect collection of every battle the Steel Samurai has won!"
Turnabout samurai,4,353,Judge,I... I see.
Turnabout samurai,4,354,Phoenix,"Don't you find this very odd, Your Honor? Among all his pictures of the Steel Samurai, none were taken that day!"
Turnabout samurai,4,355,Judge,Order! Mr. Wright. Have you an explanation? If the Steel Samurai had just defeated his adversary... I certainly would expect to see a picture of it in this album...
Turnabout samurai,4,356,Phoenix,"Exactly my point, Your Honor! ... ... .........! (No... wait... no way!)"
Turnabout samurai,4,357,Mia,Phoenix? I think we've finally discovered the truth. And what a truth it is!
Turnabout samurai,4,358,Phoenix,M-Mia... are we sure about this? Did he actually...?
Turnabout samurai,4,359,Mia,"Yes. I'm pretty sure what you're thinking is right. Tell them, Phoenix. Tell them what the truth is."
Turnabout samurai,4,360,Judge,Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what is going on here! Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder? Why would the boy have erased the photos he took?
Turnabout samurai,4,361,Phoenix,"I can think of only one reason, your honor. The Steel Samurai didn't win! That's why Cody deleted those photos."
Turnabout samurai,4,362,Judge,You mean the Steel Samurai... lost?
Turnabout samurai,4,363,Phoenix,"Well, Cody? I'm right, aren't I? Tell the truth. The bad guy defeated the Steel Samurai!"
Turnabout samurai,4,364,Cody,N-n-n-no way! No! I-it's impossible! Th-the Steel Samurai never loses! He never loses to anyone! Ever!
Turnabout samurai,4,365,Phoenix,"Your Honor... The witness has revealed everything with his words. There was a reason why he lied and told us he didn't take a picture. The same reason he erased his precious photos! For Cody, it was inconceivable that the Steel Samurai could be defeated. However, Cody witnessed the impossible! He saw the Steel Samurai lose! Yet to admit what he saw would destroy everything he believed in! That's why he lied and said the Steel Samurai won. He couldn't handle the truth!"
Turnabout samurai,4,366,Judge,"O-Order! I will have order! W-witness! I mean, Cody! Is this true!? W-what did you see? Tell the court what you saw!"
Turnabout samurai,4,367,Cody,I...... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
Turnabout samurai,4,368,Phoenix,"Cody... That day, you saw the Steel Samurai lose a fight. Right?"
Turnabout samurai,4,369,Cody,Waaaaaaaaaaaaah! Okay okay! Y-you're right! Th-the Steel Samurai f-fell down... Th-then he didn't m-move... Waaaaaaaaah!
Turnabout samurai,4,370,Judge,Order! Order! Order!
Turnabout samurai,4,371,Edgeworth,"What kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!? The Steel Samurai was the murderer, not the victim!"
Turnabout samurai,4,372,Phoenix,"Yet according to your witness's testimony, the Steel Samurai was the one who fell!"
Turnabout samurai,4,373,Judge,Mr. Wright! What's going on?
Turnabout samurai,4,374,Phoenix,"Apparently, we have all made a serious error."
Turnabout samurai,4,375,Edgeworth,An... error? What's this all about!?
Turnabout samurai,4,376,Phoenix,"If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple. At the end of the fight, the Steel Samurai fell to the ground, and lay still. In other words, the Steel Samurai was not the killer, he was the victim! Don't you see? Jack Hammer was the Steel Samurai!"
Turnabout samurai,4,377,Judge,"Order! Order! Order! So, the Steel Samurai in this photograph... You're saying the man in this costume was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer?"
Turnabout samurai,4,378,Phoenix,"That's what I'm saying, Your Honor. Jack Hammer was present at the action scene run-through that morning. Thus, he obviously knew about Will Powers's foot injury."
Turnabout samurai,4,379,Judge,B-but wait! Hadn't Mr. Hammer gone to Studio One already?
Turnabout samurai,4,380,Phoenix,That's what everyone thought! But remember what Ms. Oldbag said in her testimony?
Turnabout samurai,4,381,Oldbag,"On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station."
Turnabout samurai,4,382,Phoenix,"Mr. Jack Hammer left the Employee Area after lunch. However, no one saw him going to Studio One. Nor was there a picture of him. He waited for Mr. Powers to take a nap in his dressing room. Then he snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume."
Turnabout samurai,4,383,Judge,...
Turnabout samurai,4,384,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout samurai,4,385,Judge,But why would the victim do such a thing?
Turnabout samurai,4,386,Phoenix,I... don't know.
Turnabout samurai,4,387,Cody,... I get it!
Turnabout samurai,4,388,Phoenix,?
Turnabout samurai,4,389,Cody,I thought that the Steel Samurai was moving strange. So it was a different person inside the suit! Pops!
Turnabout samurai,4,390,Phoenix,"Huh, me? What?"
Turnabout samurai,4,391,Cody,"Actually, there was one piece of data I saved."
Turnabout samurai,4,392,Phoenix,Data?
Turnabout samurai,4,393,Cody,"Yeah, a photo on my digital camera!"
Turnabout samurai,4,394,Phoenix,! W-what!?
Turnabout samurai,4,395,Edgeworth,"Show us, quick!"
Turnabout samurai,4,396,Cody,"No way man, not if you're gonna look at me like that!"
Turnabout samurai,4,397,Judge,Now!
Turnabout samurai,4,398,Cody,*sniff* Here... This is it.
Turnabout samurai,4,399,Judge,"... Well, looking at this it's still a little hard to say. I'm afraid that it could be anyone in that costume. Your opinion, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout samurai,4,400,Phoenix,"I agree, Your Honor. This isn't decisive evidence."
Turnabout samurai,4,401,Judge,"I'm sorry, this doesn't look like it's the proof we need. I'll give it back."
Turnabout samurai,4,402,Mia,"Wait, Phoenix!"
Turnabout samurai,4,403,Phoenix,Mia? What?
Turnabout samurai,4,404,Mia,Look at that photo once more! That's it Phoenix! That photo is all the evidence you need to win this trial!
Turnabout samurai,4,405,Phoenix,Wh-what!? Y-Your Honor! May I see that photo once more please?
Turnabout samurai,4,406,Judge,C-certainly. I don't see why not.
Turnabout samurai,4,407,Mia,"Phoenix! Show him! There's a glaring, decisive inconsistency with the facts as we know them in that photo!"
Turnabout samurai,4,408,Phoenix,(Find the inconsistency in the photo!)
Turnabout samurai,4,409,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,410,Phoenix,Your Honor! Look at this!
Turnabout samurai,4,411,Judge,I see... a gate?
Turnabout samurai,4,412,Phoenix,Might I draw your attention to the number on that gate?
Turnabout samurai,4,413,Judge,"The number? Ah yes. Well, it's hard to see, but it looks like a ""2."""
Turnabout samurai,4,414,Phoenix,"Clearly not a ""1,"" Your Honor, correct?"
Turnabout samurai,4,415,Edgeworth,Aaaaaah!
Turnabout samurai,4,416,Phoenix,I believe Mr. Edgeworth sees what I'm getting at.
Turnabout samurai,4,417,Edgeworth,B-but... Th-that's impossible!
Turnabout samurai,4,418,Judge,Hmm? Eh? What's this all about? Please explain so that I might be shocked along with the rest of the court.
Turnabout samurai,4,419,Phoenix,"I'll use the studio guidemap. The body was found here, in Studio One. However, what do we see in this photo taken at the time of the murder? It does NOT say ""1"" on that gate in the photo. Your Honor! Here is the true scene of the crime! (Show the judge where the murder took place!)"
Turnabout samurai,4,420,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,421,Phoenix,"Here, at Studio Two."
Turnabout samurai,4,422,Judge,"I see! That would explain the ""2"" on the gate in the photo."
Turnabout samurai,4,423,Phoenix,"Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!"
Turnabout samurai,4,424,Phoenix,The path to the trailer was blocked!
Turnabout samurai,4,425,Judge,So we have heard.
Turnabout samurai,4,426,Phoenix,"The path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!"
Turnabout samurai,4,427,Judge,"Yes... yes, I suppose that would be the case."
Turnabout samurai,4,428,Phoenix,"Remember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two! As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime!"
Turnabout samurai,4,429,Judge,O-order! Order!
Turnabout samurai,4,430,Phoenix,"The defense makes the following claims: The scene of the crime was Studio Two! The person that the security guard, Ms. Oldbag saw was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer! Mr. Hammer, for some reason, stole a Steel Samurai costume. Then he went to Studio Two!"
Turnabout samurai,4,431,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,432,Edgeworth,This is madness! Jack Hammer is the victim! The victim! Why would he steal a Steel Samurai costume!? Are you suggesting he did so to cover up the details of his own murder!?
Turnabout samurai,4,433,Phoenix,"W-well, no, of course not..."
Turnabout samurai,4,434,Judge,Hmm...
Turnabout samurai,4,435,Edgeworth,"Or do you have proof!? Give me proof that the victim, Jack Hammer, stole the costume!"
Turnabout samurai,4,436,Phoenix,I have proof!
Turnabout samurai,4,437,Edgeworth,Y-you do!?
Turnabout samurai,4,438,Judge,"You do, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout samurai,4,439,Phoenix,"(Now that they're so surprised suddenly I'm much less confident... I think I'm right, though!)"
Turnabout samurai,4,440,Phoenix,Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!
Turnabout samurai,4,441,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout samurai,4,442,Phoenix,This is it.
Turnabout samurai,4,443,Judge,An empty... medicine bottle?
Turnabout samurai,4,444,Phoenix,"I found this on the table in the Employee Area. The same table where Mr. Hammer and Mr. Powers ate. The label reads ""sleeping pills."""
Turnabout samurai,4,445,Judge,"""Sleeping pills""...?"
Turnabout samurai,4,446,Phoenix,"The defendant, Mr. Powers, spent that entire afternoon sleeping. He was drugged... by Mr. Hammer!"
Turnabout samurai,4,447,Judge,"Wait a moment... That bottle does raise some suspicions, yes. But there is no proof that Mr. Hammer used it."
Turnabout samurai,4,448,Phoenix,"Your Honor, I have an idea."
Turnabout samurai,4,449,Judge,"An... idea? Very well, let's hear it."
Turnabout samurai,4,450,Phoenix,"I want to check this bottle for fingerprints! If my claim is true, Mr. Hammer's fingerprints should show up on this bottle!"
Turnabout samurai,4,451,Edgeworth,Hmm...
Turnabout samurai,4,452,Judge,I suppose you're right. Very well. The court will take possession of the bottle.
Turnabout samurai,4,453,Judge,"This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Cody Hackin's testimony has revealed new possibilities in this case. In fact, things may have happened very differently than we previously thought. The Steel Samurai seen by Ms. Oldbag may have been the victim, Jack Hammer. The scene of the crime was not Studio One, but Studio Two. And those in the trailer did have time to commit murder. Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout samurai,4,454,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor?"
Turnabout samurai,4,455,Judge,"Your homework is to find the answer to the following question: Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume? Also, who killed him, and why? Find the answers for me by tomorrow."
Turnabout samurai,4,456,Phoenix,(That's a lot of homework!)
Turnabout samurai,4,457,Judge,Mr. Edgeworth.
Turnabout samurai,4,458,Edgeworth,Mm?
Turnabout samurai,4,459,Judge,"You will need to reconsider your stance in this case. Above all, you will need to reconsider your suspicion of Mr. Will Powers."
Turnabout samurai,4,460,Edgeworth,"As you say, Your Honor."
Turnabout samurai,4,461,Judge,This trial will be extended until tomorrow. This is the last extension! Very well... Court is adjourned!
Turnabout samurai,4,462,Phoenix,Whew! That was a close one!
Turnabout samurai,4,463,Mia,"We were saved by a hair, but that's all that counts. I thought seriously about going home about three times during the trial."
Turnabout samurai,4,464,Phoenix,M-me too!
Turnabout samurai,4,465,Will,Really? You both seemed so... so confident!
Turnabout samurai,4,466,Phoenix,Hah! Maybe I should take up a career in acting? I was ready to pronounce you dead about three times back there.
Turnabout samurai,4,467,Mia,Me too!
Turnabout samurai,4,468,Will,D-dead!?
Turnabout samurai,4,469,Mia,"Hoh hoh. Of course, we're kidding."
Turnabout samurai,4,470,Will,Are you sure?
Turnabout samurai,4,471,Phoenix,"(I wasn't kidding...) Now, Mr. Powers. We have to go make our final investigation. But I promise you, we'll find the true killer by tomorrow's trial!"
Turnabout samurai,4,472,Will,R-right! Thanks! *sniff*
Turnabout samurai,5,0,Phoenix,"That was a close one, huh, Mia?"
Turnabout samurai,5,1,Maya,"Really? Too bad, I'm sorry I missed it."
Turnabout samurai,5,2,Phoenix,? M-Maya!
Turnabout samurai,5,3,Maya,"So, what happened?"
Turnabout samurai,5,4,Phoenix,"Well, I think I've got a pretty good idea who did it. Now all I need is a motive... and proof."
Turnabout samurai,5,5,Maya,"Wow! Good going, Nick!"
Turnabout samurai,5,6,Phoenix,"Under the ""initial trial"" system, tomorrow is the last day we have."
Turnabout samurai,5,7,Maya,"""Initial trial""...? What's that?"
Turnabout samurai,5,8,Phoenix,"That's the new court system they introduced two or three years ago. They had so many cases in the system, they decided to speed the whole process up."
Turnabout samurai,5,9,Maya,"So, under that system, trials have to end in three days?"
Turnabout samurai,5,10,Phoenix,"Yeah, pretty much. Well, we've no time to waste!"
Turnabout samurai,5,11,Phoenix,"I don't get it, Maya. Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume?"
Turnabout samurai,5,12,Maya,What!? You mean Mr. Hammer was wearing the costume!?
Turnabout samurai,5,13,Phoenix,Yeah!
Turnabout samurai,5,14,Maya,"B-but Mr. Hammer was the victim, Nick! Why would he go through the trouble of stealing it?"
Turnabout samurai,5,15,Phoenix,That's what we have to find out.
Turnabout samurai,5,16,Maya,What happened with the director's testimony?
Turnabout samurai,5,17,Phoenix,"Well, it's pretty clear that the producer and the director were both in the trailer."
Turnabout samurai,5,18,Maya,Huh...
Turnabout samurai,5,19,Phoenix,Which means that the killer has to be one of them!
Turnabout samurai,5,20,Maya,Really!? Why?
Turnabout samurai,5,21,Phoenix,Because the real scene of the crime was Studio Two... where that trailer is!
Turnabout samurai,5,22,Maya,Whaaaat!?
Turnabout samurai,5,23,Phoenix,(Hmm... was Maya always this excitable?)
Turnabout samurai,5,24,Oldbag,... ... ...
Turnabout samurai,5,25,Maya,The old windbag sure is quiet today.
Turnabout samurai,5,26,Oldbag,...
Turnabout samurai,5,27,Maya,"You know, this place is really... peaceful, like this."
Turnabout samurai,5,28,Oldbag,...
Turnabout samurai,5,29,Maya,Nick? I think her guard's down...
Turnabout samurai,5,30,Phoenix,Y-yeah?
Turnabout samurai,5,31,Maya,I bet we could even eat those donuts in the guard station... if we wanted.
Turnabout samurai,5,32,Oldbag,"... You eat, you die."
Turnabout samurai,5,33,Maya,Whew! She's alive!
Turnabout samurai,5,34,Maya,"Think back, Nick, to the day of the murder... Mr. Hammer put on the Steel Samurai costume. Then he left from here to go to Studio Two...?"
Turnabout samurai,5,35,Phoenix,Right.
Turnabout samurai,5,36,Maya,"But why? I wonder if someone called him...? Like the director, or the producer...?"
Turnabout samurai,5,37,Maya,"Hey, Nick... It's Ms. Vasquez! Hello?"
Turnabout samurai,5,38,Vasquez,...
Turnabout samurai,5,39,Maya,H-E-L-L-O!
Turnabout samurai,5,40,Vasquez,...
Turnabout samurai,5,41,Maya,H! E! L! L! O!
Turnabout samurai,5,42,Phoenix,M-Maya! You should at least try to be polite...
Turnabout samurai,5,43,Vasquez,... I'm watching the clouds. ...
Turnabout samurai,5,44,Phoenix,"(That's all she had to say, apparently...)"
Turnabout samurai,5,45,Maya,"Um, excuse me? Mr. Hammer came here on the day of the murder, and..."
Turnabout samurai,5,46,Vasquez,Shh.
Turnabout samurai,5,47,Maya,?
Turnabout samurai,5,48,Vasquez,Perhaps you didn't hear me. I'm watching the clouds. I'm not interested in talking to you.
Turnabout samurai,5,49,Maya,"Do something, Nick! She's really ticking me off!"
Turnabout samurai,5,50,Phoenix,(Oh dear...)
Turnabout samurai,5,51,Maya,Umm... Mr. Powers wasn't the killer! You don't have to cancel the Steel Samurai!
Turnabout samurai,5,52,Vasquez,I think I'm tired of the Steel Samurai.
Turnabout samurai,5,53,Maya,You... you did it! Nick! She did it! She's the killer! My Fey blood speaks to me! I know it! I know it!
Turnabout samurai,5,54,Phoenix,(Oh dear...)
Turnabout samurai,5,55,Phoenix,"Um, I was wondering if you could tell me about Mr. Manella?"
Turnabout samurai,5,56,Vasquez,... If you must talk about that man... Perhaps you could talk about it in the trailer? By yourselves?
Turnabout samurai,5,57,Phoenix,"(Oh, oh dear...)"
Turnabout samurai,5,58,Maya,"... Wasn't the assistant cleaning up yesterday? Funny, it still seems pretty messy in here."
Turnabout samurai,5,59,Phoenix,I guess she was still on a high from getting that rare card she needed.
Turnabout samurai,5,60,Maya,"I guess they're not filming today, either. I did want to see them filming... just one time."
Turnabout samurai,5,61,Phoenix,This trial will be over and done by tomorrow. You can come see them film later.
Turnabout samurai,5,62,Maya,"I guess... This is where you found that bottle of sleeping pills, right?"
Turnabout samurai,5,63,Phoenix,Uh huh.
Turnabout samurai,5,64,Maya,I wonder if there're any other clues lying around.
Turnabout samurai,5,65,Gumshoe,Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarh! No no no! No touchin'!
Turnabout samurai,5,66,Maya,Eeek!
Turnabout samurai,5,67,Gumshoe,"Oh, sorry, pal. Didn't mean to frighten you."
Turnabout samurai,5,68,Maya,D-didn't mean...? I almost had a heart attack!
Turnabout samurai,5,69,Gumshoe,Heh heh. I guess I can be a little dramatique at times... I suppose it's the actor in me...
Turnabout samurai,5,70,Phoenix,"(""Dramatique"" indeed...)"
Turnabout samurai,5,71,Gumshoe,"Ahem. Anyway, I'm here to examine the plate on that table."
Turnabout samurai,5,72,Phoenix,"Wait, are you looking for sleeping pills?"
Turnabout samurai,5,73,Gumshoe,"Yeah, pal. Traces thereof."
Turnabout samurai,5,74,Maya,So you're looking for traces of the sleeping pills... how?
Turnabout samurai,5,75,Gumshoe,"For a thorough examination I gotta take the plate back to the precinct. But I have the capabilities to make a cursory examination right here! Our science guy gave me some testing solution. This reacts to sleeping pills, see? If there're traces it'll change color."
Turnabout samurai,5,76,Maya,"Wow! Neat! Well, Detective Gumshoe? What are you waiting for?"
Turnabout samurai,5,77,Gumshoe,"Now, now, everything in due time, pal. ... ... ... Well, the testing solution on the plate changed color alright."
Turnabout samurai,5,78,Phoenix,So there were sleeping pills on the plate!
Turnabout samurai,5,79,Gumshoe,It's looking like Will Powers was drugged... I'm going to go back to the precinct to do some more detailed tests.
Turnabout samurai,5,80,Maya,"You're being very... free with your information today, Detective."
Turnabout samurai,5,81,Gumshoe,"Well... don't go telling anyone this, pal. But I was kind of impressed at today's trial, too."
Turnabout samurai,5,82,Maya,...!
Turnabout samurai,5,83,Gumshoe,"Most lawyers would've given up after that director's testimony. I think if it'd been anyone but you up there, Powers would be done for by now."
Turnabout samurai,5,84,Phoenix,How goes your investigation?
Turnabout samurai,5,85,Gumshoe,"To tell the truth, it's a real mess, pal. Some people think we should pursue the case we already have against Powers... And some people think we should switch suspects!"
Turnabout samurai,5,86,Maya,"What do you think, Detective Gumshoe?"
Turnabout samurai,5,87,Gumshoe,"Well, pal, I hate to admit it... But I'm not sure I buy the case against Mr. Powers any more. I feel kind of bad for Mr. Edgeworth, though."
Turnabout samurai,5,88,Phoenix,"How is Edgeworth doing, anyway?"
Turnabout samurai,5,89,Gumshoe,"Edgeworth is out of control! He was in the waiting room and he crushed this paper cup with hot, hot coffee in it."
Turnabout samurai,5,90,Phoenix,Whoa...
Turnabout samurai,5,91,Gumshoe,"Talk about burns, pal!"
Turnabout samurai,5,92,Maya,Wow! The fury of Edgeworth!
Turnabout samurai,5,93,Phoenix,"Yeah, crushing paper cups... (Cups... bottles...?) Say, what ever happened with that empty bottle?"
Turnabout samurai,5,94,Gumshoe,"Oh, the bottle of sleeping pills? Well, I got some good news for you about that. They found the victim, Jack Hammer's prints on the bottle."
Turnabout samurai,5,95,Maya,So that means...
Turnabout samurai,5,96,Gumshoe,"Yep, it sounds like the one who put Powers to sleep was none other than... the victim!"
Turnabout samurai,5,97,Phoenix,(So I was right!)
Turnabout samurai,5,98,Phoenix,"Detective, about that bottle..."
Turnabout samurai,5,99,Gumshoe,"Oh, that? Talk about embarrassing, pal! I can't believe I missed that on my first sweep for evidence. Don't know how I can apologize to Mr. Edgeworth."
Turnabout samurai,5,100,Maya,"It must be tough being a detective, with all that responsibility..."
Turnabout samurai,5,101,Gumshoe,"Oh, heh heh. *blush*"
Turnabout samurai,5,102,Phoenix,Could you tell me more about Ms. Vasquez?
Turnabout samurai,5,103,Will,Oh... the producer? She's well respected in the industry. They say she's a genius.
Turnabout samurai,5,104,Maya,A genius...?
Turnabout samurai,5,105,Will,"She's been at Global Studios for five years now. Right or wrong, nobody dares tell her different these days."
Turnabout samurai,5,106,Phoenix,Why is that?
Turnabout samurai,5,107,Will,"Ever since she came on board, we've had nothing but hits. Global Studios was on its knees, but she picked it up and made it shine. Oh, and..."
Turnabout samurai,5,108,Maya,And... what?
Turnabout samurai,5,109,Will,"N-nothing. Forget it. I... I've only heard rumors, anyhow."
Turnabout samurai,5,110,Phoenix,Can you tell me anything about Mr. Manella?
Turnabout samurai,5,111,Will,"Oh, he used to be a minor straight-to-video director. But something in his work caught Vasquez's eye. She brought the Steel Samurai idea to him. Now everyone knows the name Sal Manella. I hear he's pretty much at her beck and call, though. Whenever she says ""jump!"" he asks ""how high?"" and all that."
Turnabout samurai,5,112,Phoenix,(I can imagine him being at her beck and call... though I can't imagine him jumping.)
Turnabout samurai,5,113,Maya,"I was wondering about Mr. Hammer... He was a big star back in the day, right? But then he just dropped off the face of the Earth."
Turnabout samurai,5,114,Will,"Oh... Yes, you're right. In fact, he was my role model when I started in this business. But he just stopped taking on big roles. That's when he began appearing in little productions at Global..."
Turnabout samurai,5,115,Maya,"How could he do that!? I was really looking forward to a sequel to ""Samurai Summer."""
Turnabout samurai,5,116,Will,"He just gave up being a star five years ago. Actually, now that I think about it... That was right when Ms. Vasquez came to Global."
Turnabout samurai,5,117,Phoenix,(Five years ago...?)
Turnabout samurai,5,118,Penny,Oh! Hello!
Turnabout samurai,5,119,Maya,What are you doing here?
Turnabout samurai,5,120,Penny,"Oh... I was just cleaning up the dressing room. I guess WP won't be using it anymore, so..."
Turnabout samurai,5,121,Maya,Wha!? What!? Why!? But WP's innocent!
Turnabout samurai,5,122,Penny,"Yes, and I'm really grateful for all you've done. But... This week is the last episode of the Steel Samurai..."
Turnabout samurai,5,123,Maya,What!? Nooooooooooooooooo!
Turnabout samurai,5,124,Phoenix,I was wondering if I could ask you about Mr. Hammer...
Turnabout samurai,5,125,Penny,Yes?
Turnabout samurai,5,126,Phoenix,"On the day of the murder, he went to Studio Two."
Turnabout samurai,5,127,Penny,Huh? I thought he went to Studio One?
Turnabout samurai,5,128,Maya,"He stole the Steel Samurai costume, too!"
Turnabout samurai,5,129,Penny,"What!? Why would Mr. Hammer do something like that? ... Oh... I guess the rumor must be true, then."
Turnabout samurai,5,130,Maya,The rumor?
Turnabout samurai,5,131,Penny,"Yeah. Mr. Vasquez, that producer, had some kind of hold on Hammer. She had some dirt on him... He'd do anything she said, apparently."
Turnabout samurai,5,132,Maya,"Some ""dirt""? What dirt!"
Turnabout samurai,5,133,Penny,"... Dirt. You know, bad stuff."
Turnabout samurai,5,134,Maya,"... Um, I know what dirt means..."
Turnabout samurai,5,135,Penny,"About five years ago, they were filming a movie starring Mr. Hammer. They were using the new studio... Studio Two. Some sort of accident happened during filming. After that, they never used Studio Two again. They left the film set the way it was, too."
Turnabout samurai,5,136,Phoenix,"(The film set...? Was that trailer part of the film set, then?)"
Turnabout samurai,5,137,Maya,"W-what do you mean, the ""last Steel Samurai""!?"
Turnabout samurai,5,138,Penny,"I know it's a shock, but nothing can be done to save it now. Whoever really did kill Mr. Hammer, also signed the Steel Samurai's death warrant."
Turnabout samurai,5,139,Maya,No... no!
Turnabout samurai,5,140,Penny,"Also, I hear that Global Studios is going to change its programming. They're not going to make kids' shows anymore."
Turnabout samurai,5,141,Maya,W-what!? Why!?
Turnabout samurai,5,142,Penny,"I don't know. It's sad, but that's what Global Studios decided."
Turnabout samurai,5,143,Phoenix,Why aren't they going to make kids' shows anymore?
Turnabout samurai,5,144,Penny,"The studio bigwigs don't want the Steel Samurai around anymore. They want to forget all this ever happened. They want it quiet, you understand?"
Turnabout samurai,5,145,Maya,H-how can they just do that! What about all the kids who love the Steel Samurai!
Turnabout samurai,5,146,Penny,It's okay. I'm sure the kids will be fine. They'll find a new hero to follow.
Turnabout samurai,5,147,Maya,"No, that can't be true! If the program just ends, they'll be heartbroken for sure! N-Nick! Say something!"
Turnabout samurai,5,148,Phoenix,"Umm... yeah. (I think evidence, rather than words, is called for here.) Here, take a look at this."
Turnabout samurai,5,149,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout samurai,5,150,Penny,And this is...?
Turnabout samurai,5,151,Phoenix,A fan collected all of these photographs. The kids love the Steel Samurai! The show shouldn't be cancelled just so some adults can save face! I would think you would understand that better than anyone.
Turnabout samurai,5,152,Penny,... ... You're right... Okay! But what can I do?
Turnabout samurai,5,153,Phoenix,"Well, for starters... You can tell me something. Tell me what it is that Global Studios is so intent on hiding? Tell me about this accident five years ago."
Turnabout samurai,5,154,Penny,... Okay!
Turnabout samurai,5,155,Phoenix,Could you tell us what happened five years ago?
Turnabout samurai,5,156,Penny,"Well, I can tell you what I've heard. Apparently, five years ago, someone died... and it was Hammer's fault."
Turnabout samurai,5,157,Maya,S-someone died!?
Turnabout samurai,5,158,Penny,"It was an accident, of course! Anyway... The producer, Ms. Vasquez managed to hush it up."
Turnabout samurai,5,159,Phoenix,"And that's the ""dirt"" she had on Mr. Hammer?"
Turnabout samurai,5,160,Maya,"And that's why Mr. Hammer would do anything Ms. Vasquez asked him to do! ... But, it was an accident, right? Why didn't they just make it public?"
Turnabout samurai,5,161,Penny,"Well, you know Mr. Hammer was a big star back then. They were afraid about what would happen to his career if word got out."
Turnabout samurai,5,162,Maya,I see...
Turnabout samurai,5,163,Penny,"You know who knows more about this? Ms. Oldbag. She was here at the studios back then, you know."
Turnabout samurai,5,164,Phoenix,Thanks. We'll try asking her. (If she'll talk...)
Turnabout samurai,5,165,Oldbag,"What, you're still slinking around? If you like the place so much, why don't you take over for me?"
Turnabout samurai,5,166,Maya,The old windbag doesn't look so good...
Turnabout samurai,5,167,Oldbag,E-everybody's doing their darnedest to forget Hammer. Who do they think made Global Studios what it is today? Hammer! It's all due to Hammer!
Turnabout samurai,5,168,Maya,"She's starting to froth at the mouth, Nick... Maybe we should keep a safe distance?"
Turnabout samurai,5,169,Phoenix,Umm... I wanted to ask you about five years ago...
Turnabout samurai,5,170,Oldbag,! Who told!? Who did you hear that from!?
Turnabout samurai,5,171,Phoenix,"I, uh... huh?"
Turnabout samurai,5,172,Oldbag,Nichols!
Turnabout samurai,5,173,Phoenix,N-nickels?
Turnabout samurai,5,174,Maya,"Nichols, Nick. Penny Nichols. That assistant we talked to."
Turnabout samurai,5,175,Phoenix,"O-oh, right. Anyway, we heard about the accident. It was during filming with Jack Hammer... He killed a man. Didn't he?"
Turnabout samurai,5,176,Oldbag,"Wh-whippersnappers! Dredging up dirt on someone's past like that... and the recently departed, no less! I suppose you think this is fun!?"
Turnabout samurai,5,177,Phoenix,"N-no, I'm just doing my job to protect Mr. Powers..."
Turnabout samurai,5,178,Oldbag,And you claim that Hammer stole Powers's costume! You expect me to believe that rubbish!? Or do you have some kind of proof?
Turnabout samurai,5,179,Phoenix,(Proof that Hammer stole Powers's costume? Hmm...)
Turnabout samurai,5,180,Phoenix,"I'm sorry Ms. Oldbag, but I do have proof. I can prove that Mr. Hammer stole Mr. Powers's costume."
Turnabout samurai,5,181,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout samurai,5,182,Phoenix,"Mr. Powers ate a t-bone steak for lunch, correct?"
Turnabout samurai,5,183,Oldbag,W-well... yes. So?
Turnabout samurai,5,184,Phoenix,This is the plate that he used to eat that steak. There are traces of sleeping pill powder on the plate!
Turnabout samurai,5,185,Oldbag,Mmmph? Hah! I-I bet Powers put it in there himself! Even a lightweight like him must have trouble sleeping sometimes.
Turnabout samurai,5,186,Phoenix,"Except, I have proof that Mr. Hammer put the pills in."
Turnabout samurai,5,187,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout samurai,5,188,Phoenix,This bottle contained sleeping pills. Mr. Hammer's fingerprints were found on the bottle.
Turnabout samurai,5,189,Oldbag,"...! ... ... I see. Poor, poor Hammer. You did wrong, Hammer, rest your soul."
Turnabout samurai,5,190,Maya,Ms. Oldbag...?
Turnabout samurai,5,191,Oldbag,"Okay. You win. I'll talk. I'm tired, see... Tired of holding it all in."
Turnabout samurai,5,192,Phoenix,Ms. Oldbag...
Turnabout samurai,5,193,Oldbag,"You're right. Five years ago there was an accident... a fatal accident. What's worse, a paparazzi took a photo of it. That photo, well, it caused quite a stir. And guess who made it all better? Vasquez! She has ties to the mafia... She silenced that paparazzi. That was the beginning. After that, she became a force to be reckoned with here at the studio."
Turnabout samurai,5,194,Maya,I see...!
Turnabout samurai,5,195,Oldbag,"But, you have to understand... Poor old Hammer never meant any harm to anyone!"
Turnabout samurai,5,196,Maya,Ms. Oldbag...
Turnabout samurai,5,197,Oldbag,Hold on a minute.
Turnabout samurai,5,198,Maya,Poor Ms. Oldbag...
Turnabout samurai,5,199,Oldbag,"Here, take this."
Turnabout samurai,5,200,Phoenix,...? A photograph? W-wait a second!
Turnabout samurai,5,201,Oldbag,This is the picture.
Turnabout samurai,5,202,Phoenix,Is... this the trailer in Studio Two?
Turnabout samurai,5,203,Oldbag,"Hammer was supposed to fight with a bad guy on the top of those stairs, there. He pushed the other actor, and the man fell onto the flowerbox fence."
Turnabout samurai,5,204,Phoenix,B-but how did you get this?
Turnabout samurai,5,205,Oldbag,It... was a long time ago. I don't feel much like talking about it.
Turnabout samurai,5,206,Phoenix,I understand...
Turnabout samurai,5,207,Vasquez,...
Turnabout samurai,5,208,Phoenix,(She's not even looking.)
Turnabout samurai,5,209,Vasquez,Where.
Turnabout samurai,5,210,Phoenix,Wh-what?
Turnabout samurai,5,211,Vasquez,Where did you get that?
Turnabout samurai,5,212,Phoenix,"I, well..."
Turnabout samurai,5,213,Vasquez,Oldbag.
Turnabout samurai,5,214,Phoenix,O-Old...?
Turnabout samurai,5,215,Maya,"She means the security lady, Ms. Oldbag, Nick."
Turnabout samurai,5,216,Phoenix,"Right... anyway... Ms. Vasquez. You hid this incident from the press, didn't you? And you used it to control Mr. Hammer!"
Turnabout samurai,5,217,Vasquez,... The wind.
Turnabout samurai,5,218,Phoenix,The... huh?
Turnabout samurai,5,219,Vasquez,"It's gotten stronger, don't you think? The wind. ... Your conversation interests me. Let's talk about it more inside the trailer."
Turnabout samurai,5,220,Maya,Nick. She went inside the trailer.
Turnabout samurai,5,221,Vasquez,"Hmph. You came. Well then, what was that you were talking about?"
Turnabout samurai,5,222,Phoenix,"(...! Why is she so eager to talk all of a sudden?) Ms. Vasquez. You were using that accident! You were blackmailing Mr. Hammer so you could control him, weren't you? That's why he was doing kids' shows for petty change!"
Turnabout samurai,5,223,Vasquez,Hmph... So I'm a blackmailer now?
Turnabout samurai,5,224,Maya,"Well, that's what it was, wasn't it! I mean, sure, it was an accident... But you used it to drag Mr. Hammer down from his rightful place as a star!"
Turnabout samurai,5,225,Vasquez,Oh...? I haven't pulled anyone down from anywhere. Mr. Hammer's career went sour of its own accord.
Turnabout samurai,5,226,Maya,B-but! You were the cause! You pressured him... And to think it was just an accident...!
Turnabout samurai,5,227,Vasquez,"Excuse me! What is this all about? You keep saying ""accident,"" ""accident""... How are you so sure?"
Turnabout samurai,5,228,Phoenix,What do you mean?
Turnabout samurai,5,229,Vasquez,Must I spell everything out for you? Think: what would it be if it wasn't an accident?
Turnabout samurai,5,230,Phoenix,...! No... No way! You mean Mr. Hammer did it... on purpose?
Turnabout samurai,5,231,Vasquez,That is what I mean.
Turnabout samurai,5,232,Phoenix,Wh-where's your proof! Can you prove it!?
Turnabout samurai,5,233,Vasquez,"Hmph! Just think! Would he have let me run his life for five years... over a mere accident? And I ran him hard, believe you me!"
Turnabout samurai,5,234,Maya,"B-but, the security lady said it was an accident!"
Turnabout samurai,5,235,Vasquez,"Oh. Well, she was a big fan of Hammer's, you see. She jumped on the reporter who brought that photo into the studio. She wrenched it out of his hands, she did. Gave him a few bruises, too."
Turnabout samurai,5,236,Phoenix,(... So that's why she had the photo...)
Turnabout samurai,5,237,Vasquez,"She's an old fool. Of course, all the reporter would need is the negatives. He could have made a copy. But he didn't. The only copy of that photo is the one you hold. Give it to me. Now."
Turnabout samurai,5,238,Maya,W-what? This is valuable evidence!
Turnabout samurai,5,239,Vasquez,Boys!
Turnabout samurai,5,240,Phoenix,... U-umm... Who are they...?
Turnabout samurai,5,241,Vasquez,Professionals. They're good at erasing... various things. What do you think...? Would you like to be erased?
Turnabout samurai,5,242,Phoenix,Wh-what!?
Turnabout samurai,5,243,Vasquez,The trial ends tomorrow? How unfortunate. It's a shame you'll have to miss it!
Turnabout samurai,5,244,Phoenix,"... Tell me why. Why do you want this photograph so badly? This is Mr. Hammer's ""dirt""... no? Why should Dee Vasquez care about it at all?"
Turnabout samurai,5,245,Vasquez,"... I'm sure you'll have plenty of time to think about that where you're going. So long, friends. Boys, erase away."
Turnabout samurai,5,246,Maya,Nooooooooooooo!
Turnabout samurai,5,247,Gumshoe,"Hold it right there! I heard everything, pal! Dee Vasquez! You're coming down to the precinct with me, now!"
Turnabout samurai,5,248,Vasquez,... Hmph. Not bad. ... Very well. It appears this contest will be decided tomorrow then. In court. I'll be looking forward to it.
Turnabout samurai,5,249,Gumshoe,"H-hey, you okay, pal? Sorry I was a little late with my entrance. I don't get many chances to practice that sorta thing."
Turnabout samurai,5,250,Maya,Detective Gumshoe... Thank you thank you thank you! I was really scared...
Turnabout samurai,5,251,Gumshoe,"Huh? Don't mention it, pal. Just doing my job. ... ..."
Turnabout samurai,5,252,Maya,Detective Gumshoe?
Turnabout samurai,5,253,Gumshoe,"Sorry, it's just... I've wanted to say that line ever since I became a detective. ... Okay. I've got one more job to do today. I'm sure we'll run into each other again soon!"
Turnabout samurai,5,254,Maya,"Well, Nick. It looks like we're getting close to the bottom of this."
Turnabout samurai,5,255,Phoenix,(And who's at the bottom...? Dee Vasquez!)
Turnabout samurai,6,0,Judge,Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.
Turnabout samurai,6,1,Edgeworth,"The prosecution is ready, Your Honor."
Turnabout samurai,6,2,Phoenix,"The defense is ready, Your Honor."
Turnabout samurai,6,3,Judge,"Today will be the final day of this trial. I hope both the prosecution and the defense will be able to present decisive evidence. Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. Your opening statement."
Turnabout samurai,6,4,Edgeworth,"In yesterday's session, the defense presented us with a new theory for this case. He claims that the scene of the crime was, in fact, Studio Two. Today, I will call on people present in the Studio Two trailer that day. From their testimonies, the truth will become clear."
Turnabout samurai,6,5,Judge,Hmm... very well!
Turnabout samurai,6,6,Phoenix,(Edgeworth seems a bit on edge today...)
Turnabout samurai,6,7,Judge,"You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth."
Turnabout samurai,6,8,Edgeworth,The prosecution calls Ms. Dee Vasquez to the stand. Ms. Dee Vasquez is a producer who was present in the Studio Two trailer that day.
Turnabout samurai,6,9,Edgeworth,Will the witness state her name and occupation?
Turnabout samurai,6,10,Vasquez,... Dee Vasquez. I am a producer for Global Studios.
Turnabout samurai,6,11,Edgeworth,"On the day of the murder, you were in the trailer in Studio Two..."
Turnabout samurai,6,12,Vasquez,"As everyone here knows, yes?"
Turnabout samurai,6,13,Edgeworth,...?
Turnabout samurai,6,14,Vasquez,"I dislike needless banter. If you must pontificate, do it when I'm not here."
Turnabout samurai,6,15,Edgeworth,Mrrph!
Turnabout samurai,6,16,Judge,"V-very well, Ms. Vasquez. Please give the court your testimony concerning the day of the murder."
Turnabout samurai,6,17,Maya,Nick! I know she did it! Make her pay!
Turnabout samurai,6,18,Phoenix,"R-right! (If she's guilty, I'll catch her with her pants down... So to speak.)"
Turnabout samurai,6,19,Judge,"Hmm... I have a question about one part of your testimony. You were ""fatigued"" so you had Sal ""take"" you...?"
Turnabout samurai,6,20,Vasquez,The van.
Turnabout samurai,6,21,Judge,Hmm?
Turnabout samurai,6,22,Vasquez,"There's a van at Studio Two. I had him take me in that. I thought it might be risky to walk, what with that monkey's head toppling over."
Turnabout samurai,6,23,Judge,"I... I see! Very well. Mr. Wright, your cross-examination."
Turnabout samurai,6,24,Maya,"This is the final battle, Nick! Let's do it!"
Turnabout samurai,6,25,Vasquez,"I entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon."
Turnabout samurai,6,26,Phoenix,By yourself?
Turnabout samurai,6,27,Vasquez,Yes.
Turnabout samurai,6,28,Phoenix,And you didn't stop in at the Employee Area?
Turnabout samurai,6,29,Vasquez,No.
Turnabout samurai,6,30,Phoenix,... Are you always this... terse?
Turnabout samurai,6,31,Vasquez,Yes.
Turnabout samurai,6,32,Phoenix,(Oh dear...)
Turnabout samurai,6,33,Vasquez,The meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00..
Turnabout samurai,6,34,Phoenix,Did no one leave during the meeting?
Turnabout samurai,6,35,Vasquez,No one. ...
Turnabout samurai,6,36,Phoenix,... C-come on... let's talk a bit more about that.
Turnabout samurai,6,37,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,6,38,Edgeworth,The witness did not come here to engage in idle conversation! Stop interrupting the testimony.
Turnabout samurai,6,39,Vasquez,"The same could be said to you, Mr. Edgeworth. And please stop banging on your little desk. It hurts my ears."
Turnabout samurai,6,40,Edgeworth,Mmph!
Turnabout samurai,6,41,Vasquez,"There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One."
Turnabout samurai,6,42,Phoenix,And when exactly was that?
Turnabout samurai,6,43,Vasquez,I've forgotten.
Turnabout samurai,6,44,Phoenix,...
Turnabout samurai,6,45,Vasquez,...
Turnabout samurai,6,46,Phoenix,Maybe you could try remembering?
Turnabout samurai,6,47,Vasquez,No.
Turnabout samurai,6,48,Edgeworth,"The meeting ended at 4:00, and the rehearsal was scheduled for 5:00... I would think it was between those times."
Turnabout samurai,6,49,Phoenix,"(You ""would think""!? C'mon, all you did was state the obvious, Edgeworth!)"
Turnabout samurai,6,50,Vasquez,"I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me."
Turnabout samurai,6,51,Phoenix,"Hold on! You had Sal ""take"" you? What does that mean!?"
Turnabout samurai,6,52,Vasquez,It means what I just said. I had Sal take me in the Studio Two van.
Turnabout samurai,6,53,Phoenix,"(Oh... oh, right.)"
Turnabout samurai,6,54,Vasquez,"At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting."
Turnabout samurai,6,55,Phoenix,And what were you doing during that time...?
Turnabout samurai,6,56,Vasquez,Don't hit your desk. It irritates me.
Turnabout samurai,6,57,Edgeworth,Yeah! Mr. Wright...! Oops.
Turnabout samurai,6,58,Vasquez,... It was a 15 minute break...
Turnabout samurai,6,59,Vasquez,Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.
Turnabout samurai,6,60,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout samurai,6,61,Phoenix,Do you have someone who can verify this?
Turnabout samurai,6,62,Vasquez,Sal.
Turnabout samurai,6,63,Phoenix,N-no... I mean someone else?
Turnabout samurai,6,64,Vasquez,One person is enough.
Turnabout samurai,6,65,Phoenix,(If she committed murder during that break... She wouldn't have had time to eat a t-bone steak! If I had some evidence that proved she didn't eat that steak...)
Turnabout samurai,6,66,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,6,67,Phoenix,Hah! As I thought!
Turnabout samurai,6,68,Vasquez,...
Turnabout samurai,6,69,Phoenix,You claim you ate a t-bone steak! But I say you did not!
Turnabout samurai,6,70,Judge,"W-what's this, now, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout samurai,6,71,Phoenix,Look at this.
Turnabout samurai,6,72,Judge,It's... a plate?
Turnabout samurai,6,73,Phoenix,"This plate was on the table in the employee room. As you can see, a large bone has been left behind."
Turnabout samurai,6,74,Edgeworth,Mr. Wright. Need I remind you it was a T-BONE STEAK!?
Turnabout samurai,6,75,Phoenix,Exactly my point! Remember if you will... Ms. Vasquez and Mr. Manella ate at a table outside the trailer. Yet there were no bones left on the plates! The plates were bare!
Turnabout samurai,6,76,Vasquez,!
Turnabout samurai,6,77,Phoenix,"Ms. Vasquez? Tell me, how can a person eat a t-bone steak... and not leave the bone? I think I know how!"
Turnabout samurai,6,78,Phoenix,You didn't eat any steak during that break! You took your steak and threw it somewhere... like that incinerator!
Turnabout samurai,6,79,Vasquez,! ...
Turnabout samurai,6,80,Judge,I... I see! Then what was Ms. Vasquez doing during her break?
Turnabout samurai,6,81,Phoenix,"Isnâ€™t it obvious, Your Honor?"
Turnabout samurai,6,82,Phoenix,She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!
Turnabout samurai,6,83,Judge,Order! A-are you saying...!?
Turnabout samurai,6,84,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor! As Ms. Vasquez left the trailer to eat her steak... She ran into the Steel Samurai! And then you did it. You killed him with your own hands!"
Turnabout samurai,6,85,Vasquez,!!!
Turnabout samurai,6,86,Judge,M-Mr. Wright! I-isn't that a little presumptuous!?
Turnabout samurai,6,87,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,6,88,Edgeworth,"What kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!?"
Turnabout samurai,6,89,Vasquez,Let him claim what he wants.... You say I did it?
Turnabout samurai,6,90,Phoenix,Yes.
Turnabout samurai,6,91,Vasquez,"Fascinating! And here I was worrying that today would be as boring as all the rest. ... Very well. Let us have a battle of wits, you and I."
Turnabout samurai,6,92,Phoenix,"(Any day, Vasquez!)"
Turnabout samurai,6,93,Maya,"Good luck, Nick!"
Turnabout samurai,6,94,Vasquez,"Let's see... What was that murder weapon again? Oh yes, the ""Samurai Spear."""
Turnabout samurai,6,95,Phoenix,Yes...?
Turnabout samurai,6,96,Vasquez,"I am, as you can see, a woman of petite stature. How could I possibly use that heavy spear as a weapon?"
Turnabout samurai,6,97,Phoenix,I think you would have a great deal of difficulty using that as a weapon. Pretty much anyone would.
Turnabout samurai,6,98,Vasquez,Hah. You see?
Turnabout samurai,6,99,Phoenix,Yes...
Turnabout samurai,6,100,Phoenix,"However, that has no bearing on this case!"
Turnabout samurai,6,101,Vasquez,... Meaning?
Turnabout samurai,6,102,Phoenix,The Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon!
Turnabout samurai,6,103,Vasquez,What!?
Turnabout samurai,6,104,Judge,What is the meaning of this!? The spear was found lying next to the victim's body!
Turnabout samurai,6,105,Phoenix,"I have proof, Your Honor. I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!"
Turnabout samurai,6,106,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout samurai,6,107,Phoenix,"I present my proof: the so-called ""murder weapon""!"
Turnabout samurai,6,108,Edgeworth,"B-but, that IS the murder weapon!"
Turnabout samurai,6,109,Phoenix,"Not so fast. Remember that this spear broke during the morning action scene run-through? But, someone fixed the spear. It was the security lady! She fixed it with duct tape! Now tell me, how is it possible... for someone to stab a man who is wearing a thick costume with this!? Through the chest!"
Turnabout samurai,6,110,Judge,O-order! Order!
Turnabout samurai,6,111,Edgeworth,Mr. Wright! What are you driving at!? Think about what you're--
Turnabout samurai,6,112,Vasquez,Silence! Iâ€™m the one testifying here and I will be heard!
Turnabout samurai,6,113,Edgeworth,Mmmph...!
Turnabout samurai,6,114,Vasquez,"Are you quite sane? Are you even aware of what you're saying? If the Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon, then pray tell what was!? How was Hammer killed?"
Turnabout samurai,6,115,Judge,"Well, Mr. Wright? Can you tell us what weapon was used to kill Mr. Hammer?"
Turnabout samurai,6,116,Phoenix,Would I make a claim like that if I couldn't tell you what the weapon was?
Turnabout samurai,6,117,Judge,"Iâ€™m afraid your confidence can sometimes be unfounded, Mr. Wright... Very well, let's see this murder weapon, then."
Turnabout samurai,6,118,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout samurai,6,119,Phoenix,Look at this photo.
Turnabout samurai,6,120,Judge,"W-what is this? Why, that's Jack Hammer standing at the top of the stairs! O-order! Order! If I cannot have order this trial will be suspended! Mr. Wright! What is this all about!?"
Turnabout samurai,6,121,Phoenix,This photograph is from five years ago. There was an unfortunate accident at Global Studios. This is a photo of that very accident. Not a word of this was leaked to the outside. It was a close-kept secret at the studios.
Turnabout samurai,6,122,Edgeworth,What does this have to do with the current case!?
Turnabout samurai,6,123,Phoenix,Mr. Edgeworth... You still can't see it? See the fallen man in this photo? See how the fencepost pierced him through the chest?
Turnabout samurai,6,124,Edgeworth,Wh... what!? Are you saying...!?
Turnabout samurai,6,125,Phoenix,Yes. What happened five years ago... has happened again!
Turnabout samurai,6,126,Vasquez,!!!
Turnabout samurai,6,127,Judge,Mr. Wright! Continue!
Turnabout samurai,6,128,Phoenix,"It's 2:30 PM on the day of the murder! Ms. Dee Vasquez meets Jack Hammer outside the Studio Two trailer! Then she did it! She pushed Mr. Hammer off the stairs onto the fence! Just like Mr. Hammer had himself done five years ago! Though whether she did it on purpose or by accident, I cannot say."
Turnabout samurai,6,129,Vasquez,...!
Turnabout samurai,6,130,Edgeworth,"I-in other words... th-the victim, Mr. Hammer... He died in the same way that he caused another man to die... five years ago!"
Turnabout samurai,6,131,Phoenix,"Precisely. Ironic, isnâ€™t it?"
Turnabout samurai,6,132,Vasquez,"... Hoh hoh. Very creative, Mr. Wright. I could use a man like you on my script writing staff."
Turnabout samurai,6,133,Phoenix,You deny that what I say is true?
Turnabout samurai,6,134,Vasquez,"... Mr. Wright. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that Hammer died at the trailer as you say. Yet the body was found at Studio One, was it not? And in the Evil Magistrate's costume, no less. Are you then claiming that I carried the body to Studio One... And returned to the trailer all in the space of a 15 minute break? How could I have disposed of the body!?"
Turnabout samurai,6,135,Phoenix,...
Turnabout samurai,6,136,Edgeworth,"The break in the meeting at the trailer lasted 15 minutes, from 2:30 to 2:45. Could Jack Hammer have been pushed off the stairs to his death... then carried to Studio One and placed inside his costume? There wasnâ€™t enough time!"
Turnabout samurai,6,137,Judge,"Hmm... indeed. Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?"
Turnabout samurai,6,138,Phoenix,"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?"
Turnabout samurai,6,139,Vasquez,For instance?
Turnabout samurai,6,140,Phoenix,"Actually, for that matter, there was no need for her to do the deed in 15 minutes! And there was a way for you to carry that body."
Turnabout samurai,6,141,Vasquez,!!! I-interesting! Let's hear it then.
Turnabout samurai,6,142,Judge,Mr. Wright? Please show us how she carried the body.
Turnabout samurai,6,143,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout samurai,6,144,Phoenix,Ms. Vasquez. You carried the body to Studio One. And you used the studio van to do it!
Turnabout samurai,6,145,Vasquez,!!!
Turnabout samurai,6,146,Phoenix,Recall your testimony...
Turnabout samurai,6,147,Vasquez,"There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One. I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me. There was a van there, right? I had Sal drive me."
Turnabout samurai,6,148,Phoenix,"You used the van to carry the body to Studio One! Then, before everyone else got there, you put the body into the Magistrate costume!"
Turnabout samurai,6,149,Vasquez,...!
Turnabout samurai,6,150,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,6,151,Edgeworth,"Hold on, Wright! Don't forget, it was Sal Manella that drove the van! Are you suggesting that Mr. Manella was a conspirator?"
Turnabout samurai,6,152,Phoenix,"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator! The body had to be placed in the van, and put into the costume. There's no way Ms. Vasquez could have done that alone! Also, don't forget that they had to dispose of the Steel Samurai costume. They had to... because it was covered in Mr. Hammer's blood! They probably burned it in that small incinerator. Well, Ms. Vasquez! Shall I continue?"
Turnabout samurai,6,153,Vasquez,"... No need. You're smarter than you look, Mr. Wright. Hmph. I lose. You win. It... was fun."
Turnabout samurai,6,154,Phoenix,(I... win!?) ...
Turnabout samurai,6,155,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout samurai,6,156,Judge,...
Turnabout samurai,6,157,Phoenix,Umm... So... what happens next?
Turnabout samurai,6,158,Vasquez,?
Turnabout samurai,6,159,Phoenix,"Don't ""?"" me! Donâ€™t you have anything to say!?"
Turnabout samurai,6,160,Vasquez,What would you like me to say?
Turnabout samurai,6,161,Phoenix,"Huh? ""I lost""? Something like that!"
Turnabout samurai,6,162,Vasquez,I just said that.
Turnabout samurai,6,163,Phoenix,"W-wait, so you mean... Dee Vasquez! So, it was you? You killed Jack Hammer! ..."
Turnabout samurai,6,164,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout samurai,6,165,Judge,...
Turnabout samurai,6,166,Vasquez,Who can say?
Turnabout samurai,6,167,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout samurai,6,168,Vasquez,Are you sure I did? Mr. Wright... We just engaged in a battle of wits. And the result of that battle? You proved the possibility that I murdered Hammer.
Turnabout samurai,6,169,Phoenix,R-right!
Turnabout samurai,6,170,Vasquez,"But... that is only a possibility. Proof is another thing altogether. You lack decisive proof, Mr. Wright."
Turnabout samurai,6,171,Phoenix,Wha... wha... wha... wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT!?
Turnabout samurai,6,172,Judge,"Order! Mr. Edgeworth, your thoughts?"
Turnabout samurai,6,173,Edgeworth,"Umm... uhh... mmmph. O-of course, it's as the witness says! ... Certainly, it does seem very likely she did it... but, uh, there's no proof!"
Turnabout samurai,6,174,Phoenix,(...! Edgeworth isn't sure!)
Turnabout samurai,6,175,Vasquez,"... Well? I came here as a witness today. If you've no more questions, I'll be leaving."
Turnabout samurai,6,176,Phoenix,(Urk! What do I do now!?)
Turnabout samurai,6,177,Phoenix,...
Turnabout samurai,6,178,Judge,"Yes, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout samurai,6,179,Phoenix,I was hoping I'd come up with a question while pounding on my desk. I didn't.
Turnabout samurai,6,180,Judge,... You have my sympathies.
Turnabout samurai,6,181,Phoenix,"(Damn... damn! To come so far, only to fail...)"
Turnabout samurai,6,182,Judge,"As it seems there are no further questions... I would like to end the cross-examination of the witness, Ms. Vasquez."
Turnabout samurai,6,183,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,6,184,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout samurai,6,185,Judge,"Yes, Mr. Edgeworth?"
Turnabout samurai,6,186,Edgeworth,"I was hoping I'd come up with a question while I was objecting, Your Honor... I didn't."
Turnabout samurai,6,187,Judge,I see... Very well.
Turnabout samurai,6,188,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,6,189,Edgeworth,Your Honor! I request that the witness testify again!
Turnabout samurai,6,190,Vasquez,"You are the prosecutor, are you not? Why are you badgering me? I'm your witness!"
Turnabout samurai,6,191,Edgeworth,I... I just want to hear your testimony again.
Turnabout samurai,6,192,Vasquez,"Does this make any sense to you, Your Honor? I don't see that we have anything to gain by repeating the last several minutes."
Turnabout samurai,6,193,Judge,"Mr. Edgeworth... I, too, see little point in making Ms. Vasquez repeat herself. What exactly did you want her to testify about?"
Turnabout samurai,6,194,Edgeworth,"Mmmph! Well, yes, um... ... Indeed! Verily, I say... Ergo! I want to hear about what happened... after they found the body!"
Turnabout samurai,6,195,Judge,After they found the body...? Very well. The witness will testify to the court concerning this matter.
Turnabout samurai,6,196,Vasquez,Hmph.
Turnabout samurai,6,197,Maya,Nick! Why did Edgeworth...?
Turnabout samurai,6,198,Phoenix,"Who knows? He probably realized she did it, too."
Turnabout samurai,6,199,Maya,But... but! Wasn't he the one that said he always gets a guilty verdict...? After all that...
Turnabout samurai,6,200,Phoenix,(Edgeworth...)
Turnabout samurai,6,201,Vasquez,"I was with Sal and Oldbag, the security lady, when we found the body."
Turnabout samurai,6,202,Phoenix,What time was that?
Turnabout samurai,6,203,Vasquez,We were to meet at 5:00 for the rehearsal. So I'd say it was then.
Turnabout samurai,6,204,Phoenix,When exactly did you and Mr. Manella arrive at the studio?
Turnabout samurai,6,205,Vasquez,"About 10 minutes before. I wasn't stuffing any bodies into costumes, mind you."
Turnabout samurai,6,206,Phoenix,(Hmm...)
Turnabout samurai,6,207,Phoenix,Where were the other employees when you got to the studio?
Turnabout samurai,6,208,Vasquez,They weren't there yet.
Turnabout samurai,6,209,Phoenix,"Well!? Then you could have put Hammer in that costume, with Sal Manella's help!"
Turnabout samurai,6,210,Vasquez,"Oh? What did I just say? Did I not just say ""I wasn't stuffing any bodies into any costumes""...? You should try to listen to what people are saying, boy."
Turnabout samurai,6,211,Phoenix,(B-boy!?)
Turnabout samurai,6,212,Judge,The witness will continue her testimony.
Turnabout samurai,6,213,Vasquez,"The assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent."
Turnabout samurai,6,214,Phoenix,"Mr. Powers was taking a nap, correct?"
Turnabout samurai,6,215,Vasquez,So he says.
Turnabout samurai,6,216,Phoenix,Did no one go to call him?
Turnabout samurai,6,217,Vasquez,Remember...
Turnabout samurai,6,218,Phoenix,Remember... what?
Turnabout samurai,6,219,Vasquez,There was a dead body lying in front of us. Yet you expect me to be calm?
Turnabout samurai,6,220,Phoenix,(You certainly seemed calm enough when I accused you of murder! *sigh*)
Turnabout samurai,6,221,Phoenix,Wait a second! Wouldn't that be the other way around!?
Turnabout samurai,6,222,Vasquez,The other way around?
Turnabout samurai,6,223,Phoenix,"You discovered a murdered body, and one person was missing, right? Wouldn't you normally go looking for the missing person!?"
Turnabout samurai,6,224,Judge,"Hmm... I have to agree with the defense on this one. Well, Ms. Vasquez?"
Turnabout samurai,6,225,Vasquez,"Hmph. Logically speaking, perhaps. But no one there was thinking very logically, I assure you. Also. Without his Steel Samurai costume, Powers doesn't really stand out. We often left him on the bus when shooting at location. No one noticed he was missing."
Turnabout samurai,6,226,Phoenix,(Poor Powers...)
Turnabout samurai,6,227,Judge,"Hmm... Well, I suppose that explains that. Very well, Ms. Vasquez. You may continue."
Turnabout samurai,6,228,Vasquez,I immediately called the police. Then Powers showed up.
Turnabout samurai,6,229,Phoenix,What was everyone else doing at that time?
Turnabout samurai,6,230,Vasquez,"No one said a thing. It was silent. Completely silent. So we stood there until Powers finally arrived on the scene. ""Sorry! Sorry I'm late!"" Then... silence. Dead silence."
Turnabout samurai,6,231,Phoenix,...
Turnabout samurai,6,232,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout samurai,6,233,Judge,...
Turnabout samurai,6,234,Vasquez,Silent.
Turnabout samurai,6,235,Maya,"Hey... Hey, Nick. Why's everyone so quiet? Someone should do something to lighten things up!"
Turnabout samurai,6,236,Vasquez,"The security lady, Oldbag, was quite agitated. Pointing at Powers, saying ""he did it!"""
Turnabout samurai,6,237,Phoenix,(Oldbag... the security lady.) Why did the security lady think Powers had done it?
Turnabout samurai,6,238,Vasquez,She said because she saw him going toward the studio.
Turnabout samurai,6,239,Phoenix,(Right... the Steel Samurai.)
Turnabout samurai,6,240,Phoenix,Did the detective arrest Mr. Powers based solely on the security lady's word?
Turnabout samurai,6,241,Vasquez,"Perhaps not. She seems to have given the detective that photograph... Of course, I heard all this after the fact."
Turnabout samurai,6,242,Phoenix,(That photograph... meaning the one taken by the security camera.)
Turnabout samurai,6,243,Vasquez,She's not known for exhibiting the best sense of judgment when it comes to Hammer.
Turnabout samurai,6,244,Phoenix,(Hmm. I don't think there's anything in there I can use.)
Turnabout samurai,6,245,Vasquez,I asked to be left out of the proceedings.
Turnabout samurai,6,246,Phoenix,"You ""asked to be left out""?"
Turnabout samurai,6,247,Vasquez,Yes. It seems that everyone else was questioned. And I'm really not fond of that sort of thing.
Turnabout samurai,6,248,Phoenix,"But, you can't decide who the police will and won't question!"
Turnabout samurai,6,249,Vasquez,"Thankfully, the studio thinks otherwise. They were nice enough to understand that, since we were in a meeting... There was no way we could be involved. Thus, they covered for us."
Turnabout samurai,6,250,Phoenix,"(Covered for you... or covered it up for you? There must have been a lot riding on it, with all those bigwigs at the meeting... I'm sure her ""professionals"" helped convince everyone they didn't require questioning.)"
Turnabout samurai,6,251,Vasquez,I went back to the trailer to get my script and direction notes.
Turnabout samurai,6,252,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout samurai,6,253,Phoenix,The script and your direction notes?
Turnabout samurai,6,254,Vasquez,"Yes, they're quite valuable. It wouldn't do to have them stolen."
Turnabout samurai,6,255,Phoenix,"No, I guess not."
Turnabout samurai,6,256,Phoenix,Wait a second! I thought you came to Studio One for a rehearsal! Why didn't you bring your script and notes!?
Turnabout samurai,6,257,Vasquez,"Well, I was under the impression that we wouldn't be able to rehearse anything."
Turnabout samurai,6,258,Phoenix,Why?
Turnabout samurai,6,259,Vasquez,"There was a murder, after all! Who could think of rehearsing after that!"
Turnabout samurai,6,260,Phoenix,"(Oh, yeah, I guess...)"
Turnabout samurai,6,261,Judge,"Hmm... Very well. Ms. Vasquez, please continue..."
Turnabout samurai,6,262,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,6,263,Edgeworth,Your Honor!!! I have an objection to the witness's last statement!
Turnabout samurai,6,264,Phoenix,(Huh...!?)
Turnabout samurai,6,265,Edgeworth,Think! Ms. Vasquez said she didn't bring the script because there wouldn't be a rehearsal. Don't you see what that means? She would have had to know about the murder before going to Studio One!
Turnabout samurai,6,266,Vasquez,...!
Turnabout samurai,6,267,Judge,Order! Order! Mr. Edgeworth!
Turnabout samurai,6,268,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout samurai,6,269,Judge,"What you have just said... is a reasonable observation. However, I find it hard to understand why the prosecution would make such a move! Or are you thinking of a career change to defense!?"
Turnabout samurai,6,270,Edgeworth,"... I... appreciate the concern, Your Honor. I will stand by my statement, however, regardless of how the court sees my role here. Now, Ms. Vasquez... Do you have an explanation?"
Turnabout samurai,6,271,Phoenix,(I can't believe Edgeworth is helping me!)
Turnabout samurai,6,272,Vasquez,Hmph. So the prosecution is in cahoots with the defense? What kind of court is this? No matter. I think you misunderstood me. I had a perfectly good reason to believe there would be no rehearsal.
Turnabout samurai,6,273,Judge,"Hmm... Very well, the witness will change her testimony to reflect this reason."
Turnabout samurai,6,274,Vasquez,"I knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so I left them behind."
Turnabout samurai,6,275,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout samurai,6,276,Phoenix,How did you know about the injury?
Turnabout samurai,6,277,Vasquez,H-how did I know!? Sal. He told me.
Turnabout samurai,6,278,Phoenix,(Sal the director... Hm...)
Turnabout samurai,6,279,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout samurai,6,280,Phoenix,"You ""knew that Hammer was injured""...? Don't you think that's a little funny? I mean, it was the Steel Samurai who was injured! It was Will Powers!"
Turnabout samurai,6,281,Vasquez,Wh... what!?
Turnabout samurai,6,282,Judge,Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!
Turnabout samurai,6,283,Phoenix,"Yes, Mr. Hammer is dragging his leg in this photo. But that's because he was pretending to be Mr. Powers!"
Turnabout samurai,6,284,Vasquez,P-pretending...?
Turnabout samurai,6,285,Phoenix,"One person was inured in the run-through that morning. That person was Mr. Powers, not Mr. Hammer! Now, why did you think it was Mr. Hammer who was injured?"
Turnabout samurai,6,286,Vasquez,...! I-I already said it was Sal who told me! Th-that's right! He must have gotten it wrong.
Turnabout samurai,6,287,Phoenix,I think not. Mr. Manella was at the run-through that morning. He would have known it was Mr. Powers who was injured. He saw it happen! Why would he tell you the wrong person? Ms. Vasquez!
Turnabout samurai,6,288,Phoenix,"Actually, you didn't hear anything from Mr. Manella. You saw Mr. Hammer limping with your own eyes!"
Turnabout samurai,6,289,Judge,"Yes, but... Wasn't it Mr. Powers who was injured...?"
Turnabout samurai,6,290,Phoenix,"Yes, but remember! Mr. Hammer was dragging his leg, too! He was pretending to be Mr. Powers!"
Turnabout samurai,6,291,Judge,Aah!
Turnabout samurai,6,292,Phoenix,And when was he doing this...?
Turnabout samurai,6,293,Edgeworth,Well... It would have been after he put on the Steel Samurai costume... and went to Studio Two. Where he was murdered!
Turnabout samurai,6,294,Phoenix,"Exactly! Ms. Vasquez! You met him, didn't you? You saw the Steel Samurai limping! And Mr. Hammer was in that Steel Samurai suit! That's why you were confused! That's why you thought it was Mr. Hammer who had been injured that morning!"
Turnabout samurai,6,295,Vasquez,...!!!
Turnabout samurai,6,296,Judge,Order! Order! I will have order!
Turnabout samurai,6,297,Edgeworth,Witness! Can you refute this claim?
Turnabout samurai,6,298,Vasquez,Hrrmmmm... hmph! ... ...
Turnabout samurai,6,299,Phoenix,"(Yeah, let's see you sneak out of this one, Vasquez!)"
Turnabout samurai,6,300,Vasquez,... Very well! I have a question for you!
Turnabout samurai,6,301,Phoenix,(Urk... Why are the real killers always so... persistent?)
Turnabout samurai,6,302,Vasquez,"Why in the world would I want Mr. Hammer dead? Yes, he'd fallen on hard times, but he was a star! I had nothing to gain from his death! Nothing!"
Turnabout samurai,6,303,Judge,"Hmm... Yes, you would need a motive. Why would she have killed the victim? If there is a reason, it is unclear to this court. Does the defense have anything to say on the matter? In other words, can you prove she had a motive?"
Turnabout samurai,6,304,Phoenix,"Okay. I have proof, and I'll show it to you! I present to the court evidence as to Ms. Vasquez's motive in this murder."
Turnabout samurai,6,305,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout samurai,6,306,Phoenix,This is my proof!
Turnabout samurai,6,307,Judge,This is... the photo from before?
Turnabout samurai,6,308,Phoenix,This photo reveals the motive in this murder!
Turnabout samurai,6,309,Vasquez,...!
Turnabout samurai,6,310,Phoenix,"I'm right, aren't I, Ms. Vasquez?"
Turnabout samurai,6,311,Vasquez,Hrrrrrrm... hmph!
Turnabout samurai,6,312,Phoenix,"Five years ago, Mr. Hammer was at the height of his fame. With Dee Vasquez's help, a terrible accident was swept under the carpet... Ladies and gentlemen, the case currently up for trial... It began on that day, five years ago!"
Turnabout samurai,6,313,Vasquez,...
Turnabout samurai,6,314,Phoenix,"Ironically enough, that accident precipitated Mr. Hammer's fall... His fall from stardom!"
Turnabout samurai,6,315,Edgeworth,"His guilt weighed him down, no doubt."
Turnabout samurai,6,316,Phoenix,"However! You, Dee Vasquez, used Mr. Hammer. You made him work for you for petty change!"
Turnabout samurai,6,317,Vasquez,Hmph!
Turnabout samurai,6,318,Edgeworth,Bringing us to the present day... and Mr. Hammer's last role as the Evil Magistrate!
Turnabout samurai,6,319,Phoenix,"Yes! Undoubtedly, it was a constant source of shame for the ex-star..."
Turnabout samurai,6,320,Edgeworth,Hmm...
Turnabout samurai,6,321,Judge,"One moment, Mr. Wright. We are talking about motives, here... yet you have only talked about Mr. Hammer. It almost seems as if... As if it was Mr. Hammer who had killed Dee Vasquez, not the other way around! What motive would Ms. Vasquez have?"
Turnabout samurai,6,322,Vasquez,"Y-yes, that's right. According to what you say... I would have no reason to kill Hammer. He was a good source of income for me! And I never get rid of useful men. It's a policy of mine."
Turnabout samurai,6,323,Judge,Mr. Wright? Please explain Ms. Vasquez's motive for murder.
Turnabout samurai,6,324,Phoenix,"She had no motive, Your Honor."
Turnabout samurai,6,325,Judge,What's that now!?
Turnabout samurai,6,326,Phoenix,It was Mr. Hammer who was out for blood! All Ms. Vasquez did was push him off the stairs... in self defense!
Turnabout samurai,6,327,Edgeworth,What's that now!?
Turnabout samurai,6,328,Phoenix,It's simple! Mr. Hammer was intending to kill Ms. Vasquez!
Turnabout samurai,6,329,Edgeworth,Wha-!? WHAT!?
Turnabout samurai,6,330,Phoenix,"Your Honor! Jack Hammer drugged Mr. Powers with sleeping pills! Jack Hammer snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume! Jack Hammer wore the costume to fool the security lady into thinking he was Powers! Then Jack Hammer made his way to the trailer! And for what purpose, you ask? To kill Dee Vasquez, who had so cruelly taken advantage of him all those years!"
Turnabout samurai,6,331,Phoenix,"So, you did do it, didn't you?"
Turnabout samurai,6,332,Vasquez,... Yes. I am guilty. It was me...
Turnabout samurai,6,333,Vasquez,"Congratulations, Mr. Wright. I lose... again."
Turnabout samurai,6,334,Judge,Mr. Edgeworth... Where's Dee Vasquez?
Turnabout samurai,6,335,Edgeworth,"In the waiting lobby, Your Honor. As calm and collected as ever..."
Turnabout samurai,6,336,Judge,I see... Mr. Wright.
Turnabout samurai,6,337,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor?"
Turnabout samurai,6,338,Judge,It appears you have brought about yet another miracle.
Turnabout samurai,6,339,Phoenix,"I... thank you, Your Honor."
Turnabout samurai,6,340,Edgeworth,"I think not, Your Honor. Will Powers was innocent. That he should be found so is only natural... not a miracle."
Turnabout samurai,6,341,Judge,"... Yes. Yes, you're right. Very well. This court finds the defendant, Mr. Will Powers..."
Turnabout samurai,6,342,Judge,Not Guilty
Turnabout samurai,6,343,Judge,That is all. The court is adjourned!
Turnabout samurai,6,344,Will,I... I donâ€™t know what to say! Thank you so much!
Turnabout samurai,6,345,Phoenix,Iâ€™m just glad youâ€™re okay.
Turnabout samurai,6,346,Will,"Yes... but... it's sad. I know now that Mr. Hammer stole my costume. It's bad enough that he wanted to kill Ms. Vasquez... But to think that he tried to frame me for the murder! It makes me sad... Tell me why, Mr. Wright!"
Turnabout samurai,6,347,Phoenix,H-huh?
Turnabout samurai,6,348,Will,Tell me! Why did Mr. Hammer want to blame me...?
Turnabout samurai,6,349,Phoenix,"Well, this is what I think. Mr. Hammer wanted to put the blame on you because..."
Turnabout samurai,6,350,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout samurai,6,351,Phoenix,It's because you were the Steel Samurai.
Turnabout samurai,6,352,Will,Because I was the Steel Samurai?
Turnabout samurai,6,353,Phoenix,"Mr. Hammer was a big star, once. But he was reduced to acting in a kids' show... and as the villain, to boot! The kids love the Steel Samurai. And so, he hated you."
Turnabout samurai,6,354,Will,I... I think I understand. H-he could have just told me. I would have changed places with him any time!
Turnabout samurai,6,355,Phoenix,(I think youâ€™re missing the point...)
Turnabout samurai,6,356,Will,... Thank you. I'm just glad it's all over.
Turnabout samurai,6,357,Phoenix,(So am I... so am I...)
Turnabout samurai,6,358,Maya,"Congratulations, WP!"
Turnabout samurai,6,359,Will,"Oh? Oh! Heh heh. Thanks to you, I'll be able to don the Steel Samurai outfit once more! I can't wait to get back into that sweaty costume and... ...? Is... something wrong?"
Turnabout samurai,6,360,Maya,N-no! O-of course not... Aah! N-Nick! Edgeworth!
Turnabout samurai,6,361,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout samurai,6,362,Phoenix,...
Turnabout samurai,6,363,Edgeworth,"... Say something, Wright. I'm not good at small talk."
Turnabout samurai,6,364,Phoenix,"Huh? What? ... Umm... that was too bad, Edgeworth!"
Turnabout samurai,6,365,Edgeworth,"You don't waste any time gloating, do you?"
Turnabout samurai,6,366,Phoenix,No... I really wanted to thank you. Vasquez would have gotten away if you hadn't stepped in.
Turnabout samurai,6,367,Will,"Ah, uh, pleased to meet you. I'm Powers. *sniff*"
Turnabout samurai,6,368,Edgeworth,"Ah, er, Edgeworth. I'm a big fan of your work, Mr. Powers."
Turnabout samurai,6,369,Phoenix,(Liar!)
Turnabout samurai,6,370,Edgeworth,"... Wright. I must say, I hadn't expected to meet you again after all these years."
Turnabout samurai,6,371,Maya,"Meet ""again""...?"
Turnabout samurai,6,372,Edgeworth,"However. In retrospect, it would have been better had we not met. Thanks to you, I am saddled with unnecessary... feelings."
Turnabout samurai,6,373,Phoenix,Unnecessary feelings?
Turnabout samurai,6,374,Edgeworth,Yes. Unease... and uncertainty.
Turnabout samurai,6,375,Phoenix,Arenâ€™t those kind of necessary?
Turnabout samurai,6,376,Edgeworth,"They only serve to get in my way. You listen to me, Phoenix Wright. Don't ever show your face in front of me again. That's what I came here to tell you."
Turnabout samurai,6,377,Will,Umm... Mr. Wright? Is... this guy your friend?
Turnabout samurai,6,378,Maya,"What? Friends? As if! Theyâ€™re rivals! Rivals! Right, Nick?"
Turnabout samurai,6,379,Phoenix,For now we are... I guess.
Turnabout samurai,6,380,Maya,"Huh!? Why do I get the feeling I'm missing something? C'mon, Nick! Tell me! Whatâ€™s the deal with you and Edgeworth?"
Turnabout samurai,6,381,Phoenix,"And so the curtain closes on another trial... I caused quite a stir by revealing that accident from five years ago. It was the talk of the town. Thankfully, Global Studios rethought its programming change. They went back to making kids' shows again."
Turnabout samurai,6,382,Maya,"Nick! This is it! The new show starts today! You're going to watch it with me, right?"
Turnabout samurai,6,383,Phoenix,"(I'll admit, I was kind of surprised... I didn't think they'd seriously go through with it...)"
Turnabout samurai,6,384,Maya,"You have to buy trading cards too, okay! We have to trade with Cody and that assistant!"
Turnabout samurai,6,385,Phoenix,"Fine, fine. I'll do it."
Turnabout samurai,6,386,Maya,Isn't it great that WP gets to play the lead again? I wonder if they'll show his real face this time...
Turnabout samurai,6,387,Phoenix,I dunno... I don't think the world is ready for the real Will Powers...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,0,Maya,"Hey, hey, Nick! Do you know if there's any good waterfalls around here?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,1,Phoenix,Waterfalls...? Dare I ask why?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,2,Maya,"Duh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,3,Phoenix,... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,4,Maya,"Of course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,5,Phoenix,"Umm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close..."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,6,Maya,Oh. Darn.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,7,Phoenix,"Sorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,8,Maya,... Good idea!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,9,Phoenix,(So much for the rushing spring waters...)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,10,TV,"Next in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it ""Gourdy"" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ..."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,11,Phoenix,*yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,12,Maya,Nick?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,13,Phoenix,?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,14,Maya,The water pressure's kind of low in that shower.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,15,Phoenix,"... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,16,Maya,"... Good idea, Nick!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,17,Phoenix,"(Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...)"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,18,TV,"We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin! Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it's murder!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,19,Phoenix,(Gourd Lake again?)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,20,TV,"The body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect's name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... has he thrown it all away?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,21,Phoenix,(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What's going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--
Turnabout goodbyes,1,22,Maya,Nick?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,23,Phoenix,Yipes! M-Maya!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,24,Maya,The fireman yelled at me when I called him.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,25,Phoenix,We've got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,26,Maya,"What? You mean, the prosecutor?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,27,Phoenix,"Yeah, he's a suspect... in a murder!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,28,Maya,Whaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,29,Phoenix,I-I don't know!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,30,Maya,"Let's go find out, Nick!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,31,Maya,"You know, Nick... We've all been in here one time or another, haven't we?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,32,Phoenix,I guess it comes with the territory.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,33,Maya,I'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,34,Phoenix,... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,35,Edgeworth,What are you doing here!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,36,Maya,"Nick, I don't think he's in a very good mood."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,37,Phoenix,"Well, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,38,Edgeworth,"So, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,39,Maya,Nick... Should we be laughing?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,40,Phoenix,Nah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,41,Edgeworth,... Yes you do.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,42,Phoenix,"(Actually, he's right.)"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,43,Edgeworth,... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,44,Phoenix,"(Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.)"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,45,Phoenix,Edgeworth. Tell me what happened.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,46,Edgeworth,... Why should I? What are you going to do about it?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,47,Maya,"Duh! We're going to help you, that's what!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,48,Edgeworth,...! ... Help me? You? Don't be ridiculous.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,49,Phoenix,Sorry...?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,50,Edgeworth,You're a novice! You've only been in three trials!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,51,Phoenix,H-hey!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,52,Edgeworth,"Sure, you got lucky and won all three... But your luck's bound to run out some day! You need real skill, Wright. Experience!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,53,Phoenix,...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,54,Maya,Nick! He's insulting you! Nick? Why am I always the one who has to get angry!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,55,Phoenix,"The murder took place at Gourd Lake, correct?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,56,Edgeworth,Yes... late last night.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,57,Phoenix,The lake is a long way away from your offices and the court... Why were you down there?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,58,Edgeworth,... I see no need to tell you.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,59,Maya,M-Mr. Edgeworth! You... you didn't really...?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,60,Edgeworth,... Gourdy.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,61,Maya,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,62,Edgeworth,I went to see Gourdy.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,63,Maya,"""Gourdy""? What's that!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,64,Phoenix,I'll... tell you later. (Why won't Edgeworth talk to us?)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,65,Edgeworth,Your attorney's badge...?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,66,Phoenix,Edgeworth. Let me defend you.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,67,Edgeworth,"... Hah! Hah hah! Good one, Wright. But I'm not that hard up. Not yet."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,68,Maya,Wh-what do you mean by that?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,69,Edgeworth,Me? Trust a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer with only three trials under his belt? Never!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,70,Maya,Wh-what!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,71,Edgeworth,"My case is near hopeless, Wright. Every defense attorney I've talked to has turned me down."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,72,Phoenix,What?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,73,Edgeworth,"Simply put, they were afraid they'd lose. It occurred to me that it might be my fault that they lack confidence. After all, I did get every single one of their clients declared ""guilty."""
Turnabout goodbyes,1,74,Phoenix,I don't believe it!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,75,Edgeworth,"Regardless, I don't want you involved in this. You in particular I cannot ask to do this."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,76,Phoenix,"Edgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask... But... you didn't do it, right? Right?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,77,Edgeworth,... Think what you will. I have only one request.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,78,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,79,Edgeworth,Stay out of this case.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,80,Maya,Why!? B-but Nick is trying to help you!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,81,Edgeworth,"I know...! I know that! But I don't want your help, okay?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,82,Maya,!!! Why not?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,83,Edgeworth,"... Look, just go away, and leave me alone!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,84,Maya,"Nick... Mr. Edgeworth did it, didn't he."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,85,Phoenix,Maya! Let's go investigate elsewhere.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,86,Maya,"But, Nick..."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,87,Maya,This is where it happened?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,88,Phoenix,Yeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,89,Maya,I can see some police walking around in there.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,90,Phoenix,"Questioning people, probably."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,91,Maya,Hey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,92,Gumshoe,"Well, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,93,Police,"S-sorry, sir... Nothing."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,94,Gumshoe,"Idiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,95,Police,"B-but, sir... There weren't any clues... that's why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It's clear, sir. He's the one who--"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,96,Gumshoe,"Shaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do! I mean... just, get outta my face, pal!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,97,Police,"Y-yes, sir!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,98,Maya,Detective Gumshoe's kinda scary today!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,99,Gumshoe,Recruits... peh! ... Aah!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,100,Maya,Eek!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,101,Gumshoe,"Hey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,102,Phoenix,Wright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,103,Gumshoe,"And just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,104,Phoenix,"Huh? Um, well, yes. I suppose."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,105,Gumshoe,"Well, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,106,Maya,He seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,107,Gumshoe,Huh!? Oh? Y-you don't say...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,108,Phoenix,Detective Gumshoe? Do you know what happened here?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,109,Gumshoe,"Huh? You don't know, pal?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,110,Phoenix,No...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,111,Gumshoe,"Wow, okay, Mr. head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,112,Phoenix,Head-in-the... huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,113,Gumshoe,"Never mind, I'll tell you. It happened last night, about 15 minutes after midnight. There was a boat out on Gourd Lake. In that boat were two men. One of those men shot the other with a pistol."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,114,Maya,And... the shooter was Mr. Edgeworth?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,115,Gumshoe,A cop who arrived on the scene arrested him.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,116,Maya,How did he get there so fast?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,117,Gumshoe,"Well... There was a witness. When the report came in, we raced to the lake."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,118,Phoenix,A witness?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,119,Phoenix,Who was this witness?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,120,Gumshoe,"Er, sorry, pal. That's confidential. Anyway, the witness saw everything, apparently. I'm sure they'll turn up at the trial tomorrow."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,121,Phoenix,Was there only that one witness?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,122,Gumshoe,"Yep. It was pretty cold out on the lake last night. And, it was Christmas Eve after all. Still, we're being thorough. You never know when you're going to turn up another witness. That's why we're here today, checking things out. So far, we're coming up empty..."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,123,Maya,"Oh! It's Christmas today! I'd forgotten. What are you getting me for Christmas, Nick?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,124,Phoenix,Talk to Santa.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,125,Maya,I-is it true? No one will take Mr. Edgeworth's case?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,126,Gumshoe,"Yeah... He's a bit of a celebrity. If you defended him, and lost, your reputation'd be sure to suffer. What's more... The case against him is... well, it's pretty solid."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,127,Phoenix,(I suppose it would be if they have a witness.)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,128,Gumshoe,Hey! Pal! Don't tell me your going to turn your back on him too!? Remember the Steel Samurai! Mr. Edgeworth helped you get your client declared innocent!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,129,Phoenix,"I... I know. I went to Edgeworth. I tried. He really doesn't want us to represent him. Especially not us, he said."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,130,Gumshoe,"What!? W-well, that doesn't make any sense, pal! You should have heard him talking about you after the Steel Samurai case! He kept saying ""Wright, Wright, Wright"" over and over."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,131,Maya,... Nick? I'm not sure that's a good sign.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,132,Phoenix,Neither am I...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,133,Gumshoe,Why wouldn't he want your help? I don't get it.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,134,Police,"Detective Gumshoe, sir!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,135,Gumshoe,What? Find something!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,136,Police,"Um, no, sir. Not yet. But there was a call from the precinct. They want to hold an investigation briefing..."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,137,Gumshoe,"A briefing? Right! I'm off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,138,Maya,"Well, yes. Do you have any information on the victim...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,139,Gumshoe,"Sorry... They haven't worked up the autopsy report yet. I'm still waiting for it myself. Actually... Say, if you get the time, drop by the precinct! We can talk more there, pal!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,140,Phoenix,"You're not coming back, Detective?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,141,Gumshoe,"Erm... Probably not, pal."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,142,Phoenix,"So, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,143,Gumshoe,"Ah, right. Here, I'll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,144,Phoenix,"Oh, hey! Detective Gumshoe!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,145,Gumshoe,W-what!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,146,Phoenix,"Um, we'd like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,147,Gumshoe,"Yeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,148,Maya,"You know, Nick. I think there's something to be said for talking to people when they're busy."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,149,Phoenix,Yeah. They don't have time to think about not giving you information...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,150,Maya,"Right! Now, let's get investigating!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,151,Maya,"Wowsers! This is ""Gourd Lake""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,152,Phoenix,"Yup. I'm not sure it warrants a ""wowsers,"" though."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,153,Maya,"Hmm. Probably not. But hey, look at that snack stand!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,154,Phoenix,"""Samurai Dogs""...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,155,Maya,I wanna Samurai Dog! Please! I bet they're great!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,156,Phoenix,"With a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,157,Maya,"They're a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into ""The Pink Princess"" now. I mean, like, y'know!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,158,Phoenix,(Nope.)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,159,Maya,"Huh. Someone left one of those poppers here. You know, you pull the string..."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,160,Phoenix,"...and it goes ""pop."" Yeah, I know the ones. You see them a lot around New Year's."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,161,Maya,"Hey, Nick! It might be a clue! Let's take it."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,162,Phoenix,"C'mon, admit it. You just want to pop it, right?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,163,Maya,Was it that obvious?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,164,Phoenix,(A popper... hmm.)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,165,Phoenix,I suppose it couldn't hurt to take it. Huh? Where'd it go?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,166,Maya,I already put it in my pocket.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,167,Maya,"I like it here, Nick. Look... someone's camping!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,168,Phoenix,"They've got guts, camping at the scene of a murder."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,169,Maya,"Hey, hey, Nick! If they were camping here last night, they might know about the murder!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,170,Phoenix,"(That's true...) Good call, Maya. Let's go talk to them."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,171,Maya,"Hey, Nick. Check out this camera!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,172,Phoenix,"Yeah... what's with the big mic and that box on top, I wonder? It looks like some sort of automatic system for taking a photo when a noise is heard."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,173,Maya,"Wow! Hey, let's see if it works! *cough* ""Hi, I'm Nick!"" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. ""YO! I'M NICK!!!"" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,174,Phoenix,Will you stop that?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,175,Maya,"I think it's broken, Nick."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,176,Phoenix,D-don't kick it! (It must not be set up to respond to voices.)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,177,Maya,Well what then? I know!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,178,Phoenix,The party popper...?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,179,_,*BANG*
Turnabout goodbyes,1,180,_,klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik
Turnabout goodbyes,1,181,Maya,... Yep. It responded.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,182,Lotta,"Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw! Hey, you! Git yer hands offa' that!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,183,Maya,Eek!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,184,Lotta,What in the Sam Hill...!? Look what ya done now! There goes a whole roll of film!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,185,Maya,Ah? Wha... huh? S-sorry!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,186,Lotta,Sorry's nice but it don't pay my bills! Y'all know how much a roll of film costs!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,187,Maya,I-I'll pay you back!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,188,Lotta,What were ya'll thinkin' settin' off a party-popper in a place like this?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,189,Maya,Uh... well...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,190,Lotta,"What! Don't try to play stupid with me just 'cause you think I'm some country bumpkin! Yeah, I know how y'all Yanks think! ""I say, those southern folks talk with that exaggerated drawl, why they must be dumb!"" Well let me tell you, just because I might be dumb don't mean we all are!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,191,Maya,"N-Nick, help!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,192,Lotta,"And who are you, now? Her chaperone?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,193,Phoenix,"Yeah, uh, no, rather, uhh... we're sort of... friends?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,194,Lotta,"Jus' figure out what y'all are gonna say and say it for bejeezum's sake! Gawd, I'd rather sit through one of papa's drawls than listen to you stutter all day."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,195,Phoenix,(Oh boy... I guess we should pay her for the film...)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,196,Lotta,Watch it!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,197,Phoenix,"Yes ma'am. (On second thought, I'll pay later...)"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,198,Maya,I'm really sorry!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,199,Phoenix,Ummm...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,200,Lotta,What!? Can't ya see I'm changin' the film on my camera here! Someone--I'm not namin' any names--but someone used up a WHOLE ROLL.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,201,Maya,Sorry...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,202,Phoenix,(That didn't work... I wonder if I have anything to show her that would get her attention...)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,203,Phoenix,"I, er, this is my badge."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,204,Lotta,Huh? Aren't badges supposed t' be all shiny and impressive? You a cop or something?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,205,Phoenix,Umm... I'm a lawyer.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,206,Lotta,Wh-what!? Y'all ain't gonna try and pull one o' them lawsuits on me over that film now? Cause I'll have you know I'm a fighter and I wrassled meaner looking' things'n you!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,207,Phoenix,"N-no, that's not it at all. We're here investigating a murder that took place here, on the lake."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,208,Lotta,"A murder...? ... Sounds cool! Why didn't y'all say that in the first place! Go ahead, ask me anything ya like!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,209,Phoenix,(Finally! Some cooperation!)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,210,Lotta,You too. Y'all can come out of hiding now. I won't bite. Hard.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,211,Phoenix,"(Come to think of it, where did Maya get to?)"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,212,Maya,S-sorry... I-I was feeling a little overwhelmed. The culture gap and all...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,213,Lotta,"Never you mind, honey. I kin' talk Yank for ya if... ahem... if it pleases you?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,214,Maya,Th-thanks. I think I'll be okay.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,215,Lotta,"Great then! I'm Lotta, Lotta Hart, but y'all can call me Lotta! I'm here photographing meteor showers for a research project. Mighty pleased ta meet ya!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,216,Lotta,"Oh yeah, when was that murder, anyway? I ain't seen much television lately."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,217,Phoenix,It happened late in the night on Christmas Eve.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,218,Lotta,That so? Christmas Eve?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,219,Phoenix,A man on a boat was shot... Did you see anything?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,220,Lotta,"Well, lemme see. A boat, ya say? I reckon I mighta seen one... not sure though. Y'all gotta remember I've been watching this here lake for a good three days now. I seen enough boats to choke a mule. Kinda hard to remember which I seen when."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,221,Maya,"So, what is it you do, Lotta?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,222,Lotta,"Huh? Me? Hah hah. Y'all don't really want to know that, do ya? Actually, I'm a research student at Country U., right in the heart of the heartland."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,223,Maya,Wow! Neat! Nick! She's a research student at a university! Country U.!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,224,Phoenix,Uh... so I hear.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,225,Maya,"So, when did you come up here?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,226,Lotta,"Hmm, lemme see... I guess it was 'bout three days ago."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,227,Phoenix,What are you photographing?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,228,Lotta,"D-didn't I tell y'all that already? Meteors! Yep, meteor showers!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,229,Phoenix,(Falling stars...?)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,230,Maya,That's quite a camera you have there.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,231,Lotta,Y'all better know it! It's German-made. A genuine Solingen!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,232,Phoenix,(Isn't that where they make knives...?)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,233,Maya,"Umm... So, what's that device you have stuck to the camera?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,234,Lotta,Huh? Device?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,235,Maya,It started moving all by itself when I fired my party popper...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,236,Lotta,Oh that? That triggers the shutter whenever it detects certain sounds. It's programmed to pick up loud noises right now.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,237,Maya,A programmable camera! Neat!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,238,Phoenix,Lotta?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,239,Lotta,Yeah?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,240,Phoenix,"So, your camera... it triggers on loud explosion noises?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,241,Lotta,Ayup.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,242,Phoenix,"Actually, the victim in the case we're researching--he was shot with a pistol."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,243,Lotta,A pistol...?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,244,Phoenix,Right. Now wouldn't a gunshot make a similar noise to our party popper...?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,245,Lotta,I guess it would.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,246,Phoenix,"Your camera... didn't get a picture of the murder, did it?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,247,Lotta,... Hey! Y'all are pretty bright!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,248,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,249,Lotta,"I see what yer sayin'... Tell ya what, I'll have a look-see at my film."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,250,Phoenix,It would have been a photo taken late last night...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,251,Lotta,"I checked 'em once, don't remember if there was anything on 'em though. But what if I got sumtin'! I could be witness to a genuine murder! Yeehaw! I'll go check that film. Y'all come back now, y'hear?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,252,Maya,She went inside her SUV. I guess we should come back later...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,253,Maya,... I guess Detective Gumshoe is still in that meeting.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,254,Gumshoe,"Hey! Thanks for coming down, pal!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,255,Maya,Detective Gumshoe!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,256,Gumshoe,We just finished the meeting. For better or for worse...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,257,Phoenix,(I get the feeling we're in for some bad news...)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,258,Phoenix,"So, how did the meeting go?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,259,Gumshoe,"I can't tell you, pal! You're a lawyer!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,260,Phoenix,T-true...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,261,Gumshoe,"... Y'know... I don't know what to believe anymore. Sure, Mr. Edgeworth's human like you or me. Still... I get the feeling that if he'd done something wrong, he wouldn't go hiding it. That's just the kind of guy he is. Why can't anyone else see that?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,262,Maya,"So, they think that Mr. Edgeworth did it...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,263,Gumshoe,"Well, the trial's starting tomorrow, as scheduled."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,264,Maya,I see...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,265,Gumshoe,...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,266,Phoenix,"Umm... hey, in the end you did tell us about the meeting!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,267,Gumshoe,"... Don't go telling anyone else, pal."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,268,Phoenix,"Y-yes, sir!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,269,Gumshoe,"And... do me a favor! Stand by Mr. Edgeworth! He needs help, and you're the ones to help him! I'm sure he's got some reason why he won't talk to us."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,270,Maya,"Thanks, Detective Gumshoe."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,271,Maya,Detective Gumshoe... How come you trust Mr. Edgeworth so much?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,272,Gumshoe,"Well, I'd think that was obvious. We got a strong working relationship, us two. We trust each other, and that's how it works."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,273,Maya,"A ""working relationship""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,274,Gumshoe,"See, Mr. Edgeworth always gets his defendants declared ""guilty"" every time. Yeah, his methods right be a little extreme at times. But... there's a reason! He trusts our investigation, see? He trusts us to get the right man! That's why I work extra hard, pal. We've got to earn that trust he places in us."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,275,Maya,I see...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,276,Gumshoe,Mr. Edgeworth is a man you can trust... And you have my word on that!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,277,Phoenix,"I was wondering, did you ever get that autopsy report?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,278,Gumshoe,"Oh, that? Yeah, I made a copy for you."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,279,Phoenix,Thank you.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,280,Maya,...Nick?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,281,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,282,Maya,Can you show me that photo of the victim? ... That face...!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,283,Phoenix,Someone you know?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,284,Maya,I... I don't know. I just have this feeling that I met him somewhere a long time ago. ...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,285,Maya,...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,286,Phoenix,What is it?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,287,Maya,"Oh. Nothing... just, something's been bothering me. ... Could you show me that autopsy report once more? ... ... ... Hey! I-I remember now! This guy! This is a lawyer that was at that office Mia worked at! I met him once when I went there to hang out with Sis!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,288,Phoenix,That office...? Wait! You mean Grossberg's office?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,289,Maya,Right! That guy!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,290,Phoenix,(That was the last name I expected to come up... Maybe I should go talk to him... for old time's sake.)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,291,Phoenix,It's been a while since I was here last. Mr. Grossberg is out as usual.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,292,Maya,"Hey, Nick. Look at the wall."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,293,Phoenix,(That painting is still missing... Mia must have known about the deal with Mr. Grossberg and Redd White... She kept track of all of White's extortion and blackmail rackets.)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,294,Lotta,Hey y'all!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,295,Maya,Lotta!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,296,Lotta,Wait up a sec! We got bingo!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,297,Maya,Bingo...?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,298,Lotta,My automatic camera took two pictures last night!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,299,Maya,Hey!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,300,Lotta,This is them. Take a look!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,301,Phoenix,Wait...!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,302,Lotta,See? See? He's shooting him with that pistol!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,303,Phoenix,"I-it looks like that, yes."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,304,Maya,But you can't really tell who that is shooting.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,305,Lotta,"Yeah, well there was enough fog out there last night t' strangle a bullfrog. But, y'know... Seeing these photos reminded me of something."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,306,Maya,What...?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,307,Lotta,I saw the murder happen. I'm a witness!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,308,Maya,Whaaaaaaa!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,309,Phoenix,A-are you serious!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,310,Lotta,Course!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,311,Phoenix,(How do you forget... never mind.)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,312,Lotta,Y'all reckon I should tell the cops?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,313,Phoenix,I... reckon so!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,314,Lotta,What's that? Now don't y'all go tryin' to mock my accent! I'm a sensitive lady!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,315,Lotta,"Hey, so, I'm off to talk to the cops. Y'all can have this photo. Later."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,316,Phoenix,W-w-wait! Lotta!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,317,Lotta,What? Can't y'all see I'm kinda busy?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,318,Phoenix,"T-tell us what you saw, too! Please?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,319,Lotta,"Nice try, honey, but I wasn't born yesterday. I'm a witness, and that means I'm on the side of justice, and that means the cops! I'd sooner eat the south side of a north-bound skunk than tell you!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,320,Maya,L-Lotta!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,321,Lotta,"Don't let it get your skivvies in a bunch. Friends today, enemies tomorrow! Or was that the other way round? No matter. I'm gone! Hey! Maybe they'll let me do some testifying! Hot darn!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,322,Maya,"She left... ... Well, that's one more witness. What do we do now, Nick?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,323,Phoenix,"(Well, if she saw something, there's not much we can do about it. The question is: what exactly did she see...? I guess we'll find out in the trial tomorrow.)"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,324,Maya,Looks like the police have given up their questioning.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,325,Butz,Hey!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,326,Maya,Aah! N-Nick! I think Santa's mad at you!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,327,Butz,"Long time no see, Nick."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,328,Maya,Nick... you know Santa!? Wow... Nick and St. Nick... Hey! I see the connection!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,329,Phoenix,Don't be ridiculous!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,330,Butz,"Dude, it's me!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,331,Phoenix,L... Larry! What are you doing here!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,332,Butz,"Isn't it obvious? I'm working my day job! I sell Samurai Dogs! Want one? Gotta get money for dates, you know, My girl Kiyance deserves the best!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,333,Phoenix,"(K-Kiyance...? Not another model, I hope...)"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,334,Butz,"Oh, Kiyance's a fine, fine woman, Nick. It was her idea that I wear this costume! She was all ""You go girlfriend!"" Y'know? She bought this costume for me!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,335,Phoenix,"That... that's great, Larry."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,336,Maya,Wow! A Santa costume! She must be really nice!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,337,Butz,Whoa! Cute! Nick! Who's she? She's not your...?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,338,Phoenix,"Not my... what? N-no, she's not!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,339,Maya,"I'm his partner, Maya Fey. I'm, uh, the little sister."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,340,Butz,"Sister...? ... Wow, Nick, must be tough. Working nine to five, having to take care of a little sister..."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,341,Maya,"N-no, I'm not Nick's sister, I'm my older sister's little sister..."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,342,Butz,Huh. Sounds great!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,343,Phoenix,"(Don't worry, Maya, he's not listening...)"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,344,Phoenix,"Hey, Larry. There was a murder here last night... You work here. Have you heard anything?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,345,Maya,"Nick, you're wasting your time. Last night was Christmas Eve! He was with Kiyance, obviously! He wouldn't have been standing out here in the cold!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,346,Butz,Oof!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,347,Maya,?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,348,Phoenix,"I think what you just said caught him off guard, Maya."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,349,Butz,"N-no, it's just... Kiyance's not in town right now. She... she's in Hawaii on a photo shoot."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,350,Phoenix,"(A model. I knew it.) Well, anyway, there was a murder here on the lake. The trial's tomorrow."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,351,Butz,Huh. Neat.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,352,Phoenix,The defendant is Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,353,Maya,"Um, Nick? Why would Larry know Edgeworth...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,354,Butz,"Whoa, Nick! You don't mean THAT Miles Edgeworth!? Old Edgey!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,355,Phoenix,Yeah. He's a murder suspect.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,356,Butz,Wh-whoa! Murder?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,357,Maya,"Huh? You know Mr. Edgeworth, Larry?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,358,Butz,Yeah! Of course! Edgey was in the same class as us in grade school!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,359,Maya,Whaaaaaaaaat!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,360,Maya,"So, Mr. Edgeworth was your classmate, Larry?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,361,Butz,"Yeah, Nick, him, and I used to hang out all the time."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,362,Maya,Wow... I never knew.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,363,Butz,"Don't get me wrong. He's always been kind of a stick in the mud. Studying all the time, trying to ""be like father."""
Turnabout goodbyes,1,364,Maya,Like his father...?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,365,Butz,Yeah. Edgey's pop was a famous defense lawyer back in the day.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,366,Maya,"Wow. Wait... You said ""defense lawyer""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,367,Butz,Yeah.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,368,Maya,Wait a second! But Mr. Edgeworth is a prosecuting attorney!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,369,Butz,What? Edgey's got a proboscis on his knee!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,370,Maya,"No, no--he's a ""prosecuting attorney."" That's like the total opposite of a defense lawyer!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,371,Butz,"... Huh. Go figure! He always used to talk about defending the ""weak"" who were ""unable to defend themselves."" Man, he used to go on and on about man's duty to society and all that. What a bore! I wonder that changed his mind, though? Do you know, Nick?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,372,Phoenix,...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,373,Maya,Nick...?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,374,Maya,Umm... umm... tell me about the dogs!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,375,Butz,"Huh? Oh, you mean the Samurai Dogs?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,376,Maya,W-why are they Samurai Dogs? I... I mean they kind of look gourd-shaped.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,377,Butz,"Oh, well originally, they were Gourd Dogs! Y'know, like ""guard dogs""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,378,Maya,Ouch...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,379,Butz,"The Samurai thing was Kiyance's idea. Oh, she's my woman, y'know. She was all ""change the name and you go girlfriend!"" She made me that banner! Man, the kids can't get enough of those Samurai Dogs!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,380,Maya,Err... Something about that just seems... wrong.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,381,Butz,"Oh, and guess what? We're getting a ton of customers here at the lake, what with the big news!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,382,Maya,"The ""big news""...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,383,Butz,Yeah! Gourdy!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,384,Maya,"G-""Gourdy""...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,385,Maya,"Umm... what's ""Gourdy""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,386,Butz,"Huh? You mean you don't know? It's here, in this very lake! A giant, mysterious monster! Gourdy!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,387,Maya,A... monster?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,388,Butz,Yeah. Check it out. This is an article from yesterday's newspaper. There's a photo!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,389,Maya,Wow! It's r-really real! Nick! A monster! A real monster!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,390,Phoenix,"Umm... yeah. (It's probably just a log or something... right?) Hey... there's a quote here from the person who took the photo. Hmm? What's this? ""I set the camera to automatic, and when we got into the frame... I heard a loud 'bang'! Like an explosion... followed by the sound of something slipping into the water..."""
Turnabout goodbyes,1,391,Maya,I wish I could have seen it!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,392,Phoenix,(Why would there be a sound like an explosion...?) Larry. Could I borrow this article from you?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,393,Butz,"Sure, no problem. That'll be one million dollars!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,394,Maya,O-one million...?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,395,Phoenix,"(Grow up, Larry.)"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,396,Maya,... Not a Gumshoe in sight.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,397,Police,"If you're looking for Detective Gumshoe, he's in the questioning room. Apparently, an important witness turned up. He'll be in there for a while."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,398,Maya,Lotta Hart... it has to be.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,399,Phoenix,Uh oh...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,400,Edgeworth,Hmph... Who would have thought there'd be a photo...?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,401,Phoenix,Edgeworth... Did you shoot him?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,402,Edgeworth,"... What do you think, Wright?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,403,Phoenix,"I don't think you're the kind to point a gun at anyone, no."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,404,Maya,So you didn't shoot him?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,405,Edgeworth,"No, I didn't. It wasn't me."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,406,Grossberg,*Ah-HHHHEM!*
Turnabout goodbyes,1,407,Phoenix,"(Ah, that old familiar clearing of the throat!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,408,Grossberg,"Ah hah! You're Mia's... something, are you not?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,409,Phoenix,"I was her understudy, yes. Phoenix Wright."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,410,Grossberg,"Ah hah! And you, you're Mia's... something too, are you not?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,411,Maya,"Her little sister, yes!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,412,Grossberg,"You've grown! You've come to look a lot like your sister, you know? It takes me back. ""Ahh... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon..."" you see."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,413,Phoenix,"Um, Mr. Grossberg, sir?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,414,Grossberg,"Hmm...? Ah, yes. I beg your pardon. Of course you came here to discuss something. What is it then? Something the matter?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,415,Phoenix,There was a murder last night...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,416,Grossberg,A murder?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,417,Phoenix,You haven't heard...?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,418,Grossberg,"I, er, just got up, you see."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,419,Phoenix,"Well, Miles Edgeworth shot someone with a pistol."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,420,Grossberg,Edgeworth!? What!? W-who!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,421,Phoenix,"Well, the identity of the victim is still unknown."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,422,Grossberg,T-this is terrible news indeed!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,423,Phoenix,(I guess he hadn't heard anything...)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,424,Grossberg,Hmm? Strange... I feel as though I've seen this man somewhere before! ... Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,425,Phoenix,Did you remember!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,426,Grossberg,"He was a lawyer! Here, in my office! That's Hammond! Robert Hammond!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,427,Maya,Mr. Hammond...?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,428,Grossberg,And you say this is the man Miles Edgeworth shot?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,429,Phoenix,"Who is this Hammond guy, anyway?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,430,Grossberg,Mr. Hammond... He was the defense attorney in that case...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,431,Phoenix,"""That case""...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,432,Grossberg,"Yes, the ""DL-6 Incident."""
Turnabout goodbyes,1,433,Phoenix,"""DL-6""...? (Why does that sound so familiar?)"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,434,Grossberg,Perhaps you remember?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,435,Phoenix,(I'm sure someone mentioned it during the trial for Mia's murder.)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,436,Grossberg,That was the incident where the police were so at a loss they used a spirit medium.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,437,Maya,...! Wait... you don't mean? Was that medium my mother?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,438,Grossberg,"Yes, my dear. The spirit medium, Misty Fey, your mother, contacted the spirit of the victim. But... the case was a loss. No conviction was made."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,439,Grossberg,"The DL-6 Incident, yes... Happened 15 years ago. A very strange case, indeed."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,440,Phoenix,"They never caught the criminal, right?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,441,Grossberg,Correct. Misty Fey used her powers to talk to the spirit of the late victim. Her testimony led to charges being laid against one man. But Mr. Hammond won the case and the suspect was declared innocent.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,442,Maya,"... And the police blamed my mother, calling her a fraud. You were the one who helped her out then, right, Mr. Grossberg?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,443,Grossberg,"Er... y-yes. Yes, quite."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,444,Maya,Thank you!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,445,Grossberg,N-no... please. D-don't mention it.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,446,Phoenix,... (DL-6... Never thought I'd hear that name again...)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,447,Maya,But wait... What does this case have anything to do with Mr. Edgeworth?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,448,Grossberg,"It has everything to do with Mr. Edgeworth, my dear! The victim in the DL-6 Incident was none other than his father, Gregory Edgeworth!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,449,Maya,Wh-what!? His father!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,450,Grossberg,"... If you want to know more, you should ask him yourself."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,451,Grossberg,Show him this... I'm sure he'll talk to you.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,452,Maya,Wait... This is a photograph of my mother!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,453,Edgeworth,What's this? I was hoping you'd gotten my message the first time.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,454,Phoenix,"Edgeworth, what about your defense?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,455,Edgeworth,...! It's no concern of yours.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,456,Phoenix,(Guess he hasn't found anyone yet.)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,457,Phoenix,Can I ask you about the murder?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,458,Edgeworth,"Wright. I'll ask you again, just leave me alone."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,459,Phoenix,...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,460,Edgeworth,"Please try to understand. I'm not doing this to prove I'm tough, or because I look down on you. I just don't want you anywhere near this case. Understand?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,461,Phoenix,Why did you go to Gourd Lake?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,462,Edgeworth,I have no intention of telling you.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,463,Phoenix,"Nor, apparently, would you tell Detective Gumshoe."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,464,Edgeworth,!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,465,Maya,Detective Gumshoe was really worried about you!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,466,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,467,Edgeworth,...! ...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,468,Phoenix,Edgeworth?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,469,Edgeworth,"It's only been a matter of hours since you last visited. Yet you've made incredible progress in your investigation. I'll admit it, I'm impressed, Wright. You were always single-minded in your work, though. Once you start on something, you always see it through, don't you?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,470,Phoenix,"About the ""DL-6 Incident""..."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,471,Edgeworth,Right... DL-6. I didn't want you to find out about it. That is why I refused your offer to defend me. I'm sorry if it sounded like I thought you weren't up to the job. I just wanted to keep you away from DL-6.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,472,Phoenix,So... do you still think it would have been better for me to stay away?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,473,Edgeworth,"I don't know. But... I see no point in hiding anything from you now. Very well. Ask whatever you like, and I will answer to the best of my abilities."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,474,Edgeworth,"The ""DL-6 Incident""... was when my father died. Right before my eyes... He was shot and killed, and I saw it all."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,475,Maya,...!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,476,Edgeworth,"My memories from that time are... foggy. I suppose it's a self-defense mechanism. In any case, a suspect was arrested... a man. It's pretty clear he was the only one who could have killed my father. The spirit medium they used to talk to my late father said the same thing. It was an attorney by the name of Robert Hammond that cleared the suspect's name."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,477,Phoenix,And Hammond... is the victim in the Gourd Lake murder?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,478,Edgeworth,Correct.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,479,Maya,Umm... That spirit medium... that was my mom.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,480,Edgeworth,"What? You mean you're...? ... It's strange. I thought that terrible incident was about to end, and now... this."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,481,Phoenix,"""About to end""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,482,Edgeworth,The DL-6 Incident happened 15 years ago. 15 years ago... on December 28.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,483,Maya,December 28?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,484,Edgeworth,The statute of limitations on the case runs out in three days.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,485,Phoenix,What!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,486,Maya,"Um, Nick? What odes that mean?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,487,Phoenix,"When a case's statute of limitations runs out, legally, the case never happened."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,488,Edgeworth,"Three days from now, DL-6 will be closed... forever."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,489,Maya,What happened to the suspect? The one who got off innocent?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,490,Edgeworth,"I don't know... He disappeared from public view. Nobody knows where to. If he's still alive, he'd be about 50 years old now."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,491,Phoenix,(I guess I can understand why he'd go into hiding... It'd be hard to live a normal life after being a murder suspect in such a big case.)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,492,Maya,"Umm... so, was your father a lawyer?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,493,Edgeworth,"He was... Gregory Edgeworth. He was quite famous at the time, apparently."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,494,Maya,"So, you were sort of trying to follow in his footsteps."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,495,Edgeworth,... I'd rather not talk about it.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,496,Edgeworth,... Wright.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,497,Phoenix,?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,498,Edgeworth,It pains me to ask you this now...
Turnabout goodbyes,1,499,Maya,I know! You want us to defend you!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,500,Edgeworth,Yes... Will you?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,501,Phoenix,"Ah, who could have guessed this day would come?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,502,Edgeworth,Not me.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,503,Phoenix,This is my chance to finally pay you back.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,504,Maya,Pay him back...?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,505,Edgeworth,Pay me back? For what? I don't remember ever doing anything for you.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,506,Phoenix,Never mind... I guess you don't really need to know.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,507,Edgeworth,Huh... My letter of request. Please give it to Detective Gumshoe.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,508,Phoenix,"Well, I guess we should... ... W-what's that!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,509,Maya,E-earthquake! Nick! It's a big one! Whaaaaa! I-it's calming down... ... Whew... that was scary!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,510,Phoenix,...? Huh? Where's Edgeworth?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,511,Maya,"... There. He's on the floor in a ball, shivering. I guess he doesn't do so well with earthquakes."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,512,Phoenix,"(I've heard of running, but curling up in a ball?)"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,513,Maya,"Well, I guess we're done. Mr. Edgeworth doesn't seem like he's going to stand up any time soon. Let's go, Nick."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,514,Phoenix,Uh.. right. We have to give Edgeworth's letter of request to Detective Gumshoe.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,515,Gumshoe,What's going on here!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,516,Maya,Eek!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,517,Phoenix,"W-what's wrong, Detective?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,518,Gumshoe,"This wild lady comes in here just a while ago... Says she came ""to talk to y'all after hearing what Mr. Wright had to say""! What's this all about, pal!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,519,Phoenix,(Lotta Hart...)
Turnabout goodbyes,1,520,Gumshoe,"Why are you going around finding more witnesses!? You want to give Mr. Edgeworth the death sentence, pal!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,521,Phoenix,"N-no, not at all... Just... I mean, she did see something. There's nothing I can do about that. I can't go around covering up evidence!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,522,Gumshoe,Er... You trying to say something about the way I do my job?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,523,Phoenix,No sir!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,524,Phoenix,So... what did Ms. Hart say?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,525,Gumshoe,She says she saw Mr. Edgeworth fire the pistol.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,526,Maya,What!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,527,Gumshoe,She even had a photograph to prove it.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,528,Phoenix,Right. I saw it too... But you really can't tell from the photo who it is shooting.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,529,Gumshoe,"That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said ""it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!"""
Turnabout goodbyes,1,530,Maya,She can do that!?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,531,Phoenix,"(Okay, so there's going to be an enlarged photograph that shows Edgeworth in the act. Great. Just great.)"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,532,Gumshoe,"In any case, she's going to be the one testifying tomorrow."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,533,Maya,Huh? What happened to the other witness?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,534,Gumshoe,"Well... Apparently, there was a cancellation."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,535,Phoenix,"(A ""cancellation""...!?)"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,536,Phoenix,Look what I got.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,537,Gumshoe,"... Hey, you did it, pal! Glad I waited till the last minute to file those papers! I'll rip 'em up and start new ones for you!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,538,Phoenix,"Thanks, Detective. Well, see you in court tomorrow, then."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,539,Gumshoe,"Good luck, pal."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,540,Gumshoe,Hey! You guys feel that earthquake a little while back? I was worried!
Turnabout goodbyes,1,541,Maya,Worried? We're fine! I've lived out here my whole life. I'm pretty used to them by now.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,542,Gumshoe,"Oh, I wasn't worried about you two. I was worried about Mr. Edgeworth!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,543,Phoenix,"(Oh, right...) He did seem to over-react a little, now that you mention it."
Turnabout goodbyes,1,544,Gumshoe,"Yeah, well, I'm not surprised. It was a pretty big quake. I'm going to go check on him. You two go eat and get your rest for tomorrow's trial. Later!"
Turnabout goodbyes,1,545,Maya,... I wonder what it is with Mr. Edgeworth and earthquakes?
Turnabout goodbyes,1,546,Phoenix,I wonder... He was never that scared of them when he was in school.
Turnabout goodbyes,1,547,Phoenix,"(Then again, I was only in the same class as him for 4th grade. He transferred to another school after that. I wonder what happened to Edgeworth...)"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,0,Phoenix,Karma...?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,1,Edgeworth,"That's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,2,Maya,Not a single case?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,3,Edgeworth,"He'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,4,Phoenix,"Hmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,5,Edgeworth,Hmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,6,Phoenix,(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,7,Edgeworth,"He taught me what it really means to ""prosecute."""
Turnabout goodbyes,2,8,Phoenix,Wh-what!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,9,Edgeworth,Just picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,10,Maya,"Ugh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,11,Edgeworth,Something like that...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,12,Maya,"And now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,13,Edgeworth,"Not a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,14,Maya,That's pretty ruthless...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,15,Edgeworth,Like I said. He's a god among prosecutors.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,16,Phoenix,"(I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,17,Maya,Uh huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,18,Phoenix,We could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,19,Maya,Oh...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,20,Phoenix,?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,21,Maya,"I can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,22,Phoenix,"You couldn't ""reach""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,23,Maya,I think it's because I haven't been training. My powers are weak again...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,24,Phoenix,"Oh man, what bad timing!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,25,Maya,I'm really sorry. I'll try my best!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,26,Phoenix,I hope so!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,27,Edgeworth,What are you whispering about?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,28,Phoenix,"O-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in..."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,29,Judge,Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,30,Phoenix,"The defense is ready, Your Honor."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,31,Karma,...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,32,Judge,"Err, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,33,Karma,... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,34,Judge,"R-right, my apologies!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,35,Phoenix,(He's even got the Judge scared!)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,36,Judge,"Very well, your opening statement, please."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,37,Karma,... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,38,Judge,"Ah... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,39,Maya,What's with this guy? Is he royalty or something?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,40,Phoenix,How am I supposed to fight against this!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,41,Karma,"I call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,42,Phoenix,"(Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.)"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,43,Karma,Describe the incident. Now!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,44,Gumshoe,Y-yessir!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,45,Phoenix,(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,46,Gumshoe,"Er, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,47,Karma,Hmm.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,48,Karma,Testify to the court about your arrest. Now!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,49,Judge,W-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,50,Karma,Yes?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,51,Judge,"Actually, I'm the one that's supposed to be handling these proceedings..."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,52,Karma,"Wrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word ""guilty."" That is your role!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,53,Judge,"Y-yes, of course. You're quite right."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,54,Phoenix,(No he's not!!!)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,55,Gumshoe,A man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,56,Phoenix,"You received a call from a ""man""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,57,Gumshoe,Er... yup.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,58,Phoenix,"But you said there was a woman camping there? She was the one who heard the two gunshots, right?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,59,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,60,Karma,"That woman and the ""man"" who called in the report are two different people, obviously!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,61,Phoenix,Different people?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,62,Karma,There were two witnesses!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,63,Phoenix,(Urk!)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,64,Karma,Their testimonies were quite similar however. Today I've summoned the woman who was camping.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,65,Phoenix,(The woman who was camping... Lotta Hart.)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,66,Karma,"What happened next, Detective?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,67,Gumshoe,We headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,68,Phoenix,How long was it between receiving the report and your arrival at the lake?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,69,Gumshoe,"Er, well... I'd say it was about three minutes."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,70,Phoenix,That's pretty fast!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,71,Gumshoe,"Our motto for the month is ""get there quick."""
Turnabout goodbyes,2,72,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,73,Karma,Detective! You will refrain from casually revealing department secrets!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,74,Gumshoe,"Y-yessir! Sorry, sir!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,75,Karma,"Do that, and you'll be able to look forward to your next salary review."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,76,Gumshoe,"So much to look forward to, these days..."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,77,Karma,This is no time for daydreaming! Continue!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,78,Gumshoe,Y-yessir!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,79,Gumshoe,That's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,80,Phoenix,What was Mr. Edgeworth like when you saw him then?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,81,Gumshoe,"Well... From what I saw, he looked pretty relaxed. Not like a murderer at all, really."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,82,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,83,Karma,"Detective! The court requires the facts, NOT your opinion! How many years have you been on the force!? Facts only, Detective! Hard, cold, objective facts!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,84,Gumshoe,Y-y-yessir!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,85,Phoenix,"(Man, he's got his share of objections...)"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,86,Gumshoe,"Now, I didn't suspect him of anything at all."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,87,Phoenix,Why didn't you think he was suspicious?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,88,Gumshoe,"You should know! We have a deep, trusting relationship with the prosecutors."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,89,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,90,Karma,"Detective! The court isn't interested in your musings! ""Deep""? ""Trusting""? Poppycock! I've never heard so many flippant comments from an active detective on the force!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,91,Gumshoe,Mmph!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,92,Phoenix,(Detective Gumshoe doesn't look so good...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,93,Karma,Continue! Now!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,94,Gumshoe,"But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,95,Phoenix,Did you find any clues on the body?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,96,Gumshoe,A single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,97,Karma,"Judge! Here's the bullet... It didn't strike bone, so its shape is well preserved."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,98,Judge,Very well. The court accepts this bullet into evidence.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,99,Gumshoe,So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,100,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,101,Phoenix,W-why is that?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,102,Gumshoe,"Well, we found the murder weapon in the boat."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,103,Phoenix,The murder weapon...?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,104,Gumshoe,A pistol.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,105,Judge,Detective Gumshoe... That is a vital piece of information. Please revise your testimony.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,106,Gumshoe,"Right! S-sorry, Your Honor."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,107,Gumshoe,The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,108,Phoenix,"What about the pistol made it ""decisive evidence""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,109,Karma,Tsk tsk tsk...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,110,Phoenix,(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,111,Gumshoe,There were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,112,Phoenix,Wh-what!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,113,Judge,Order! Order! So Mr. Edgeworth's fingerprints were found on the murder weapon!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,114,Gumshoe,"Y-yes, Your Honor."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,115,Karma,Judge! This is the weapon in question.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,116,Judge,A-accepted into evidence.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,117,Maya,Nick. Doesn't it seem like Detective Gumshoe is being a little vague?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,118,Phoenix,I bet von Karma is feeding him lines! His testimony's probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,119,Maya,What do we do?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,120,Phoenix,"Grit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,121,Maya,"Well said, Nick! You're the man!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,122,Gumshoe,A man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,123,Gumshoe,We headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,124,Gumshoe,That's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,125,Gumshoe,"Now, I didn't suspect him of anything at all."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,126,Gumshoe,"But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,127,Phoenix,Did you find any clues on the body?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,128,Gumshoe,A single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,129,Karma,"Members of the court... We now have the pistol used in the murder, and the bullet found in the body! Detective!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,130,Gumshoe,Y-y-yessir!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,131,Karma,Was the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,132,Gumshoe,Yes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,133,Judge,Hmm...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,134,Maya,"Hey, Nick! What does he mean, ""ballistic markings""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,135,Karma,Shocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,136,Maya,N-Nick! He's glaring at me!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,137,Karma,"Tsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,138,Judge,"Eh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the ""fingerprints"" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these ""ballistic fingerprints"" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,139,Karma,"Indeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,140,Judge,O-order! Order!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,141,Phoenix,(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,142,Karma,"Well, Judge?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,143,Judge,"I'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However..."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,144,Karma,"You wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,145,Judge,Y-yes?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,146,Karma,What are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,147,Judge,"B-but, wait, I..."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,148,Karma,"Just bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,149,Judge,Y-yes! Ahem. This court will take a ten minute recess.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,150,Phoenix,"(Who's running this court, anyway!?)"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,151,Phoenix,Edgeworth! What's going on here!? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,152,Edgeworth,Uh... hmm...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,153,Phoenix,And that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,154,Edgeworth,True...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,155,Phoenix,Was that you in the boat?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,156,Edgeworth,... Yes. It was me.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,157,Phoenix,What!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,158,Edgeworth,But... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,159,Phoenix,Th-then who did!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,160,Edgeworth,I... don't know.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,161,Phoenix,You don't know!? Weren't you right there!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,162,Edgeworth,"... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,163,Phoenix,Y-you mean it was a suicide!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,164,Edgeworth,... That's the only explanation I can come up with.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,165,Phoenix,"Huh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,166,Maya,Huh? Wh-what?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,167,Phoenix,Any progress with Mia?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,168,Maya,Oh... Sorry. It's no good.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,169,Phoenix,Ugh...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,170,Maya,"I know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,171,Phoenix,"No, of course not, I need you here! I can see you're always trying to help out. Even if you don't actually help... it's the thought that counts, right?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,172,Maya,"It's okay Nick, you don't have to make me feel better."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,173,Maya,"I don't know anything about trials, or defense... What's more, I'm a spirit medium who can't even contact spirits..."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,174,Phoenix,"Aww, everyone has their off days! I mean, I've just been getting lucky lately... But you never know when my luck is going to run out!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,175,Maya,Really...?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,176,Edgeworth,W-w-whoa! Wright! Don't jinx this case any worse than it already is! It's bad for my heart...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,177,Phoenix,Oh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,178,Judge,"Court is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,179,Karma,Yes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,180,Karma,"Lotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,181,Lotta,That I am.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,182,Karma,Good. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,183,Lotta,... Y'all need to learn some manners.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,184,Karma,UNDERSTAND?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,185,Lotta,"Y-yeah, I understand, I understand!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,186,Judge,"Er... very well. Your testimony, please."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,187,Karma,Enough.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,188,Lotta,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,189,Karma,Judge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,190,Judge,W-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,191,Karma,"As the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,192,Judge,Order! Order! Order...! I will have order!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,193,Karma,"... Well, Judge?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,194,Judge,"The evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant..."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,195,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,196,Phoenix,W-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,197,Karma,"A cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read ""guilty""! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,198,Phoenix,...!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,199,Karma,"Very well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,200,Maya,"Uh, Nick... contempt...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,201,Phoenix,"""Contempt of court,"" you know?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,202,Maya,I... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,203,Phoenix,I... think I noticed one little thing...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,204,Maya,"Wow, I'm impressed, Nick! I didn't notice anything! Right! Let's take him on!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,205,Phoenix,Y-yeah... (I got a bad feeling about this...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,206,Phoenix,I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,207,Karma,Tsk tsk tsk... Very well!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,208,Judge,I pray for your sake this isn't a waste of time.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,209,Lotta,"It was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,210,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,211,Phoenix,"""Just after midnight,"" you say? In other words, it was no longer Christmas Eve... but Christmas Day!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,212,Lotta,"Huh? Uh, yeah, well, yes."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,213,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,214,Karma,"I know you want to find contradictions, but really!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,215,Phoenix,Mmmph.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,216,Judge,I hope your next contradiction is a little more relevant to the trial.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,217,Lotta,I was in my car.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,218,Phoenix,"Why were you camping there, anyway?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,219,Lotta,I'm a research student at my university. I was taking pictures to use in my research.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,220,Phoenix,(What research? This all sounds suspicious...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,221,Phoenix,"Ms. Hart. Could you be more specific about your ""research""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,222,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,223,Karma,"What does the witness's motive in camping by the lake have to do with this case!? The answer ""is nothing""! I object to this line of questioning! Objection sustained!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,224,Judge,"W-w-wait, now, I'm the one who says that!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,225,Karma,"Well, then say it already!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,226,Judge,Objection sustained.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,227,Phoenix,"(Thanks for nothing, Your Honor...)"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,228,Lotta,"I heard this ""bang"" come up from the lake."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,229,Phoenix,"So, you weren't looking at the lake at that time?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,230,Lotta,Nope. I looked after I heard that noise.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,231,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,232,Karma,"She's said that already! I asked you to find ""contradictions""! Not leisurely chat with the witness!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,233,Phoenix,(Urk...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,234,Lotta,"When I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,235,Phoenix,Could you clearly see the two men?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,236,Lotta,Just look at the picture! Clear enough for you?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,237,Phoenix,(Uh oh...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,238,Phoenix,Wait a second! I wasn't asking you about the photo! I was asking if YOU saw the two men!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,239,Lotta,"Uh, yeah, well, of course..."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,240,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,241,Karma,The witness has testified that she saw them! There's also a photo! You'd best look elsewhere for your precious contradictions!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,242,Phoenix,(He jumped in quick... He's hiding something!)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,243,Lotta,"Then there was another ""bang""..."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,244,Phoenix,Were you watching the very moment the shot rang out?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,245,Lotta,"Well, yeah, sure..."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,246,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,247,Karma,"You're asking meaningless questions! Meaningless! ""Contradictions,"" Mr. Wright. Not meaningless babble!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,248,Phoenix,"(von Karma, I think I hate you. He's trying to keep me from talking to the witness... To what end...?)"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,249,Lotta,There wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,250,Phoenix,Are you sure about that?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,251,Lotta,"Yeah, sure as a country gal can be!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,252,Phoenix,(That sounds pretty sure.)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,253,Phoenix,How come you're so sure?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,254,Lotta,"Well, heck, I scanned the whole lake."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,255,Phoenix,"(""Scanned the whole lake""? It almost sounds like she was more interested in the lake than the boat...) Ms. Hart... you--"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,256,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,257,Karma,Mr. Wright! The witness has answered the question in full.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,258,Phoenix,Mmph!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,259,Karma,No need for further questions! Objection sustained!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,260,Judge,"U-uh, that's what I'm..."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,261,Karma,Sustained!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,262,Judge,"Y-yes, of course."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,263,Phoenix,(Oh great... What am I supposed to do now?)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,264,Judge,"Enough! I think we've heard all we need to hear, Mr. Wright. It seems you are unable to find a contradiction in the testimony worth noting."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,265,Phoenix,"B-but, Your Honor!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,266,Karma,You keep your promise!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,267,Judge,Mr. Wright. I am afraid that I will have to penalize any further outbursts... By holding you in contempt of court!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,268,Karma,"And if that happens, you'll have to leave the courtroom immediately! Understood...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,269,Phoenix,Uh... uh huh.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,270,Maya,"Nick...! Lotta's testimony is fishy, Nick! Real fishy!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,271,Phoenix,"I... know what you mean. But... If I can't say anything, what can I do?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,272,Judge,I believe we've covered the evidence sufficiently to make a decision.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,273,Karma,"Then, pass your judgment!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,274,Judge,"Very well. Mr. Miles Edgeworth, please take the stand."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,275,Maya,Holdit.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,276,Judge,Wh-who was that!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,277,Maya,It... was me.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,278,Phoenix,(Maya!)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,279,Judge,I-is something wrong? D-do you need to use the facilities?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,280,Maya,"No, I do not! Lotta Hart! Your testimony stinks! It's unclear whether you were actually looking at the lake! It's highly doubtful that you actually say Mr. Edgeworth! Tell us the truth! This is a matter of life or death!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,281,Lotta,...!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,282,Maya,Lotta! Did you really clearly see Mr. Edgeworth that night!? Did you see him fire that pistol!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,283,Judge,You will stand down! The court does not acknowledge the defense's outburst!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,284,Maya,"Answer me, Lotta!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,285,Lotta,"What's the big idea, treating me like some kind of criminal!? I saw him! I swear it! I saw Edgeworth..."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,286,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,287,Karma,Enough! Judge... Declare the defense in contempt of court!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,288,Judge,"Y-yes... yes, of course. I'm sorry, but you WERE warned. Guard! Escort Mr. Wright out of the courtroom! He is in contempt of court, and must leave."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,289,Phoenix,(No... No...!)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,290,Maya,Wait!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,291,Maya,"I-I was the one who made the outburst, Your Honor! Nick is innocent!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,292,Karma,"Hah! What's the difference? All that remains is for the guilty verdict to be declared! Isn't that right, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,293,Phoenix,Wrong!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,294,Karma,What!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,295,Phoenix,"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said? She said she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth! That was not in the testimony! That changes her testimony, and I have a right to cross-examine her again!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,296,Judge,Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,297,Karma,You're in contempt of court! It's too late for wild claims! Judge! Sustain my objection!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,298,Judge,"... ... I'm sorry, Mr. von Karma, but I cannot."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,299,Karma,What!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,300,Judge,Ms. Lotta Hart has made a new testimony. The defense does have a right to cross-examine her again.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,301,Karma,B-but he is in contempt of court!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,302,Maya,"No, I am! If you're going to arrest someone, arrest me!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,303,Judge,Hmm... Very well. Maya Fey! You will leave the courtroom immediately.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,304,Maya,Nick! I did what I could... You have to do the rest! Good luck!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,305,Phoenix,M-Maya...!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,306,Karma,"Peh! I care not for this melodrama! Listen well, Mr. Wright! I do not tolerate badgering of my witnesses!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,307,Phoenix,(I'm running out of time... I'd better find a contradiction in here or else...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,308,Judge,Mr. Wright! Begin your cross-examination!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,309,Lotta,I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,310,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,311,Phoenix,"Got you. Got you, Ms. Hart! Finally!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,312,Lotta,Wh-what!? You got what?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,313,Phoenix,Look at this photograph.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,314,Lotta,The photo I took...?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,315,Phoenix,"The very same. There's something I want you to see in this photo... it's quite clearly visible. The fog, Ms. Hart."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,316,Lotta,So... so?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,317,Phoenix,"This picture was taken with professional, high quality film, correct? Yet even it could not capture the faces of the men on the boat! Yet you claim you saw Mr. Edgeworth! How!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,318,Lotta,Whut!? Wha--!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,319,Judge,Mr. Wright has a point!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,320,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,321,Karma,That's why I told her not to say that in her testimony! Please!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,322,Phoenix,"Yet, now she has said it, Mr. von Karma. How could you possibly see Mr. Edgeworth!? Explain yourself!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,323,Judge,Ms. Hart.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,324,Lotta,What!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,325,Judge,Could you see the defendant that night?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,326,Lotta,O-of course! I said I could and I meant I could!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,327,Judge,"Then, please testify as to the circumstances of your sighting."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,328,Phoenix,(I did it! I finally found a hole in von Karma's carefully vague testimony!)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,329,Lotta,"Yer right. It was a cold night, and the mist was thick as grits."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,330,Phoenix,So? How could you see Edgeworth!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,331,Lotta,"Now, just hold your horses for a second! You hasty Yankee types'd never find a gal where I'm from."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,332,Judge,Defense attorneys have trouble with that as it is.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,333,Phoenix,(Nobody loves me...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,334,Lotta,"So, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,335,Phoenix,"Your ""camera""...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,336,Lotta,Yeah. It's got an automatic...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,337,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,338,Karma,The issue we are concerned with here is Ms. Hart seeing Mr. Edgeworth! The camera has nothing to do with this at all!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,339,Judge,Objection sustained.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,340,Phoenix,(Argh! He's not letting her answer any of my questions!)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,341,Lotta,"Still, I brought my binoculars with me."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,342,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,343,Phoenix,"""Binoculars""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,344,Lotta,"Yeah, binoculars."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,345,Phoenix,"Yesterday, you mentioned that you were out looking for shooting stars, correct?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,346,Lotta,Well... yeah.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,347,Phoenix,"Wouldn't you need a telescope, not binoculars, for that?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,348,Lotta,...!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,349,Phoenix,"I've got doubts about your camera, too! Was that really to take pictures of meteor showers?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,350,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,351,Karma,The camera is irrelevant to this case!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,352,Phoenix,You can't say that for certain!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,353,Judge,"Hmm... Mr. Wright. Is the camera really relevant to this case? If you believe it is, you may continue with this line of questioning."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,354,Karma,"But know this! If you find nothing with this, there will be consequences!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,355,Judge,"Well, Mr. Wright? Do you wish to press further about the camera?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,356,Phoenix,"(This is make-it-or-break-it time!) The camera is of utmost importance, Your Honor. It is, perhaps, the key to this entire case! Therefore, I will continue my line of questioning! (Wow! Maybe I went a little overboard there...)"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,357,Judge,Very well! Ms. Hart! You will testify to the court about the camera!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,358,Lotta,"Yeah, yeah, I hear ya."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,359,Lotta,The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,360,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,361,Phoenix,Ms. Hart. What made you choose that lake to photograph meteors? You know the fog gets thick on that lake. It's not very suited to stargazing.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,362,Lotta,"Yeah, well... Y'see, I... I guess I wasn't thinking too straight! Har!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,363,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,364,Karma,Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness because of her challenged intellect!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,365,Lotta,Now wait a minute!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,366,Karma,Continue your testimony. You were saying how it was that you saw Edgeworth?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,367,Lotta,Grr...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,368,Karma,"No unnecessary comments, please."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,369,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,370,Phoenix,You were photographing shooting stars? That's a lie!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,371,Lotta,S-says who!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,372,Phoenix,"I saw the camera you set up yesterday. It was pointed directly at the lake! You have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,373,Lotta,Ooof!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,374,Judge,Mr. Wright! What are you driving at?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,375,Phoenix,"The witness was not at the lake to photograph shooting stars, Your Honor!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,376,Lotta,...!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,377,Judge,"W-well then, what exactly was she photographing?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,378,Phoenix,Your Honor! Take a look at this... What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,379,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,380,Phoenix,Ms. Hart. This is what you were trying to photograph!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,381,Judge,"What's this? A newspaper article? ""Gourdy""...? Ah, the sighting at Gourd Lake..."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,382,Phoenix,"Well, Ms. Hart?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,383,Lotta,"I... I never heard of no lake monster! You got proof or something? Let's see you prove that I was down at the lake trying to photograph this ""Gourdy."""
Turnabout goodbyes,2,384,Phoenix,I have it! Proof!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,385,Judge,Hmm... Intriguing!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,386,Judge,"Very well, let's see it. And... no joking around this time, please. Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,387,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,388,Phoenix,"The proof, Ms. Hart, is your own camera!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,389,Lotta,...!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,390,Phoenix,"You camera was set to take photos in response to loud noises, correct? Thus this photograph here, taken when a gun fired on the lake."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,391,Lotta,...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,392,Phoenix,"And here, this article about ""Gourdy."" According to this article... Gourdy made a loud noise when it emerged! Well? You were trying to photograph Gourdy, weren't you! That's why you had set your camera to respond to loud noises!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,393,Judge,"Order! Order! I see... I, too, thought it was a little strange."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,394,Phoenix,"(Yeah, sure!) Well, Ms. Hart? You were camping there to try and take a photo of Gourdy, weren't you?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,395,Lotta,"... Yeah. Not bad. Are all you lawyers that smart? So, smart boy, I was down there trying to photograph Gourdy, you got me. So what?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,396,Phoenix,Huh...?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,397,Lotta,"That don't change what I saw, does it?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,398,Karma,Exactly! What you just used several precious minutes of our time to prove... is nothing more than that the witness is an idiot who thinks monsters exist!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,399,Lotta,H-hey!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,400,Karma,"But, as she so succinctly said, so what!? It changes nothing!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,401,Phoenix,"(Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I'm getting to the bottom of this!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,402,Judge,Ms. Hart. Why did you hide the fact that you were searching for Gourdy from the court? Please revise your testimony.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,403,Lotta,"... Right. Fine, I'll testify. It won't change nothing, though."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,404,Phoenix,(Something will change... it has to! And I'm going to spot it!)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,405,Karma,...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,406,Judge,"Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,407,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,408,Karma,The witness's testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,409,Judge,Er... hmm.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,410,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,411,Phoenix,"I claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?)"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,412,Judge,"Very well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,413,Karma,Hah! That would be a first!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,414,Phoenix,"(Hah hah, very funny.)"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,415,Judge,"You understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright. Understood?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,416,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,417,Lotta,"Actually, I'm not a research student at a university."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,418,Phoenix,Then what manner of person are you!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,419,Lotta,"I'm not sure I'm high-falutin' enough to be called a ""manner"" of anything."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,420,Lotta,I'm an investigative photographer.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,421,Phoenix,"An ""investigative photographer""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,422,Lotta,"Yep. You get your photo, and sell it to the press. It's that kind of business. Hey, I was taking pictures at my sister's graduation last year... N' guess what!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,423,Phoenix,Umm... what?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,424,Lotta,There was a yoofoh just a' hanging in the sky!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,425,Phoenix,"A ""yoofoh""...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,426,Lotta,"You know, an ""Unidentified Flying Object""? A yoofoh! That's when I had sort of a revelation. I knew I should become an investigative photographer!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,427,Phoenix,I... I see. (Kind of a shaky basis for a career...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,428,Lotta,Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,429,Phoenix,"An ""investigative photographer""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,430,Lotta,"Yep. You get your photo, and sell it to the press. It's that kind of business. Hey, I was taking pictures at my sister's graduation last year... N' guess what!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,431,Phoenix,Umm... what?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,432,Lotta,There was a yoofoh just a' hanging in the sky!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,433,Phoenix,"A ""yoofoh""...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,434,Lotta,"You know, an ""Unidentified Flying Object""? A yoofoh! That's when I had sort of a revelation. I knew I should become an investigative photographer!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,435,Phoenix,I... I see. (Kind of a shaky basis for a career...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,436,Lotta,Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,437,Phoenix,That's why you put the automatic senior on your camera?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,438,Lotta,"Yep. Borrowed it from a friend at a university. It analyzes every sound it picks up, and when it gets a ""bang!""..."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,439,Phoenix,It snaps a shot.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,440,Lotta,Yep.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,441,Phoenix,"So, how many pictures has it taken so far?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,442,Lotta,The only time the camera triggered was that night.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,443,Phoenix,(Hmm...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,444,Lotta,"But, that's all I was hiding."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,445,Phoenix,I think it's time you told us why you felt you had to hide your true purpose at the lake.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,446,Lotta,"Heck, if word got out what I was up to, the lake'd be swarmin' with competitors!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,447,Phoenix,Competitors...?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,448,Lotta,Yeah! Second-rate shutterbugs trying to steal my scoop!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,449,Phoenix,Ah... Is that the only reason you were hiding the truth?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,450,Lotta,"W-well, actually..."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,451,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,452,Karma,Mr. Wright! I'll not have you asking questions with no relevance to this case!!!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,453,Phoenix,"(Whatever you say, von Karma. I know you told her to keep quiet.)"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,454,Lotta,"When I heard the ""bang"" I looked right straight out at that lake."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,455,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,456,Phoenix,Exactly what sort of sound was it?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,457,Lotta,"Well, I never heard one before so I can't say for sure... but it sounded like a gunshot. It was a lot sharper a sound than I would have expected."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,458,Phoenix,(Hmmm...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,459,Lotta,"There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,460,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,461,Phoenix,"There wasn't ""much else to look at""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,462,Lotta,Yep.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,463,Phoenix,(I dunno. If she heard a bang... and she thought Gourdy was out there... I kind of doubt she'd waste any time looking at a boat.)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,464,Lotta,What? What did I do now? What're you giving me that look for?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,465,Phoenix,(Definitely suspicious... Maybe it's time for some evidence...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,466,Karma,Witness! Continue.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,467,Lotta,"Hold your hushpuppies, pops, I'm getting there."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,468,Lotta,"Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,469,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,470,Phoenix,Was there nothing on the lake but the boat at that time?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,471,Lotta,"Huh? Wait, so you're thinking maybe he was shot from some other place? I don't think so, nope. The lake was smooth as glass, and nobody was on the shore, neither."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,472,Phoenix,(Hmm...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,473,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,474,Phoenix,Ms. Hart! Were you REALLY looking at that boat!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,475,Lotta,W-what's with you!? Course I was looking at it! It was the only thing out there! Any normal person'd be looking at it!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,476,Phoenix,"I agree, any normal person would. But you are far from normal!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,477,Lotta,Wh-what!? Y'all wanna step over here and say that!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,478,Phoenix,"You were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a loud noise? You'd be scanning the lake for any sign of Gourdy, that's what! You wouldn't give the boat a second thought!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,479,Lotta,Aah!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,480,Judge,"Order! Continue, Mr. Wright!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,481,Phoenix,"You testified that you were watching the boat through binoculars! However, you wouldn't need binoculars to watch that boat! You needed them to search for Gourdy... and that's what you were doing!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,482,Lotta,...! ... ...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,483,Phoenix,Well!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,484,Lotta,"Hmph... Well, now that y'all mention it... I did sort of take my binoculars and kind of scan the lake a bit... I mean, Gourdy might be out there, n' all..."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,485,Judge,"M-Ms. Hart! A-are you saying that you were NOT watching the boat, then?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,486,Lotta,"... S-sorry, y'all. I wasn't fibbing, really. I was, just... I thought y'know, I could be witness to a murder n' all! I kinda got excited. I was sure I was watching that boat... till now."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,487,Judge,... This... this is totally uncalled for--
Turnabout goodbyes,2,488,Lotta,B-but hey! You got the photograph! You got proof!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,489,Judge,"Hmm... Still, we can't see who is shooting who in this."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,490,Lotta,Right! Right! That's why I took this photo n'...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,491,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,492,Karma,Witness... That's enough. You've had a long day. Shut your pie-hole.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,493,Lotta,Sh-shut my what!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,494,Phoenix,(What was she going to say? She took the photo... and what? Wait a second...)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,495,Gumshoe,She even had a photograph to prove it.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,496,Phoenix,But you really can't tell from the photo who is shooting.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,497,Gumshoe,"That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said ""it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!"""
Turnabout goodbyes,2,498,Phoenix,"(She enlarged that photo! Why won't von Karma let her show it? I've got a hunch! I bet that enlarged photo shows something bad for von Karma! This is my chance! If I'm wrong, though, it'll mean prison for Edgeworth... or worse. What should I do!?)"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,499,Phoenix,"Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph. You enlarged this photograph, did you not?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,500,Lotta,Y-yeah! I did!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,501,Phoenix,Why has that enlargement not been presented to the court!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,502,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,503,Karma,B-because it does not exist!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,504,Lotta,What're y'all talking about!? You were the one who told me not to show it in court in the first place! You old fool!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,505,Judge,"What's the meaning of this, Mr. von Karma!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,506,Karma,Er... erm...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,507,Phoenix,Ms. Hart! Show the photo to the court! Show us the enlargement!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,508,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,509,Karma,The prosecution objects to the submission of this evidence!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,510,Judge,Objection... denied. The witness will show the enlargement to the court.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,511,Lotta,Here it is.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,512,Judge,"Hmm. We still cannot see who is firing in this. It could be the defendant... or maybe it's not. Regardless, I'll accept this as evidence."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,513,Karma,"Happy now, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,514,Phoenix,Hmm... (There has to be something!)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,515,Karma,"You asked for the enlargement, you got the enlargement. And little good it has done any of us! That's why I requested she not show it!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,516,Judge,Hmm... I suppose this means that the cross-examination...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,517,Karma,Is over! Obviously!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,518,Judge,"Then, I would like to close the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,519,Karma,And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,520,Judge,"Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,521,Karma,I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,522,Judge,"Nothing, of course. Then, I believe it is time for me to declare my verdict."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,523,Phoenix,(Wait... it's not supposed to go like this! There has to be a clue in this photo... somewhere! This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,524,Phoenix,Your Honor! There is something decidedly strange with this enlargement!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,525,Judge,"W-what might that be? Mr. Wright... You will show the court what you mean! What about this photo is ""strange""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,526,Phoenix,(Okay... here goes nothing! I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.)
Turnabout goodbyes,2,527,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,528,Phoenix,"Here, Your Honor!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,529,Judge,The shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,530,Phoenix,"Look at the hand holding the pistol, Your Honor!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,531,Judge,The hand...?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,532,Phoenix,That hand directly contradicts another piece of evidence!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,533,Judge,This man's left hand does what...!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,534,Phoenix,Let me show you. I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,535,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,536,Phoenix,"The evidence is clear. The man in this photograph is holding that pistol in his left hand. However! The prints on the murder weapon were from Edgeworth's ""right hand""! Ergo! The man shooting the pistol in this photograph... Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,537,Judge,Now that everyone in the courtroom has quieted down... I would like to reconvene this court of law! Mr. Wright.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,538,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,539,Judge,"You have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However... This leaves us with a rather large problem. If Mr. Edgeworth didn't do it, then who shot our victim?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,540,Karma,"Precisely! As we have seen, there were no other people on the lake that night! Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,541,Phoenix,There is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,542,Judge,Order! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed suicide?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,543,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,544,Judge,"Hmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,545,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,2,546,Karma,"I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,547,Phoenix,Wh-what!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,548,Karma,An examination of the victim's wound reveals the distance at which he was shot.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,549,Phoenix,The... distance?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,550,Karma,The victim was clearly shot from further than a meter away!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,551,Phoenix,A meter! Th-that's three feet!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,552,Karma,There is no way it could have been suicide!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,553,Judge,Order! Order! Mr. von Karma! Are you sure of the accuracy of your data!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,554,Karma,"Of course! I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,555,Judge,"Hmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day. The court orders the defense and the prosecution to further investigate this matter. Understood?"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,556,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,557,Karma,...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,558,Judge,That is all. The court is adjourned.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,559,Phoenix,"Whew, that was a close one."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,560,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout goodbyes,2,561,Phoenix,Hey! Don't you have anything to say!?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,562,Edgeworth,"No. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright."
Turnabout goodbyes,2,563,Phoenix,"Well, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!? If he didn't commit suicide, then who...? The shooter was about a meter away, too!"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,564,Edgeworth,... W-what? Don't give me that look! I did not kill him!
Turnabout goodbyes,2,565,Phoenix,I was just kidding around.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,566,Edgeworth,Hmph.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,567,Phoenix,Look... I'm going to go check on Maya.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,568,Edgeworth,Oh... Wright.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,569,Phoenix,What?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,570,Edgeworth,Tell her something for me.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,571,Phoenix,What?
Turnabout goodbyes,2,572,Edgeworth,... ... ... Tell... Tell her to watch what she says in court. That's all.
Turnabout goodbyes,2,573,Phoenix,"(Yeah, I'm sure she'll be happy to hear you say that, Edgeworth. Jerk!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,2,574,Phoenix,"I requisitioned a transcript of Lotta's entire testimony. I thought it might give me some ammunition for the trial tomorrow. Of course she didn't see the shooter... So the only part of her testimony that stood was the ""bang"" she heard."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,0,Phoenix,Maya!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,1,Maya,"Hey! Nick, it's you! I'm glad Mr. Edgeworth made it through the day okay. It's a relief..."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,2,Phoenix,"Hey. Why'd you do that, anyway?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,3,Maya,... I don't know. I... just knew I had to do something. I know I'm not the lawyer my sister was... ... I'm sorry.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,4,Phoenix,"Well, you did save the trial... Just, behave from now on, okay?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,5,Maya,O... okay.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,6,Phoenix,"Hey, Detective Gumshoe!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,7,Gumshoe,"Hey, pal! The trial today, it, er... ..."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,8,Phoenix,Yes? What about the trial?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,9,Gumshoe,"Well, I was going to say ""good show,"" but it wasn't really all that... Though you did save Edgeworth, I guess... I just wasn't sure how to thank you... you know?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,10,Phoenix,Er... thanks.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,11,Phoenix,Detective Gumshoe? Any idea what strategy von Karma is planning for tomorrow?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,12,Gumshoe,It sounds like he's bringing in another witness!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,13,Phoenix,"Another witness!? Oh, right, he said something about that in the trial today..."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,14,Karma,There were two witnesses!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,15,Phoenix,I was wondering who that other witness was! Er... who was it?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,16,Gumshoe,"S... sorry, pal. As much as I'd like to, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,17,Phoenix,(Right...)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,18,Phoenix,"Oh, right... I wanted to ask you something about Edgeworth."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,19,Gumshoe,What's up?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,20,Phoenix,Is he afraid of earthquakes? I never heard anything about that before.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,21,Gumshoe,"... Mr. Edgeworth doesn't talk about himself too much, see. But there's one thing that's clear as day... Him hating crime the way he does... And him becoming a lawyer... And him being scared of earthquakes... It all started with that incident."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,22,Phoenix,The DL-6 Incident?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,23,Gumshoe,"Yep, that's the one. Fifteen years ago... when he saw his father shot before his very eyes! He still feels the pain now, you can see it in his eyes."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,24,Phoenix,I wanted to talk to you about Maya Fey...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,25,Gumshoe,"Huh? She's not out on bail yet? That's strange. I told 'em to let her go as soon as they had their report written up. Man... I don't know what would have happened in that courtroom today if it weren't for her. Seeing her getting dragged out by the bailiff... I'll be honest with you, pal. I shed a tear or two. Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,26,Phoenix,Really!? (Cold-as-ice Edgeworth!?)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,27,Gumshoe,"He was really grateful for what she did, you know."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,28,Gumshoe,I'm going to head back to the station. I'll get the report on Maya and get her out of there as soon as I can.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,29,Phoenix,"Thank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,30,Gumshoe,Don't worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,31,Phoenix,What? Edgeworth...?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,32,Gumshoe,"Didn't I tell you? He's grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don't forget to go pick her up, okay?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,33,Phoenix,"(Hmm... Maybe I can get Edgeworth to pay this month's rent, too...)"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,34,Maya,"Hey, Nick! You finally came! They just finished the paperwork, I'm free to go."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,35,Phoenix,"Free at last, eh?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,36,Maya,"Those interrogators were really mean! They were like ""okay, what did you do THIS time?"" Like I was some kind of criminal! Can you believe it?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,37,Phoenix,"Well, they let you out in the end, didn't they?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,38,Maya,"Mmm... Oh, that reminds me... Thanks for bail."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,39,Phoenix,Thank Edgeworth.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,40,Maya,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,41,Phoenix,He posted bail for you. Said he was grateful for what you did.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,42,Maya,"Mr. Edgeworth did that...? ... I have to make it up to him! We've got to win this case, Nick!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,43,Maya,"Ahh! Fresh air! I gotta say, freedom feels great."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,44,Phoenix,"Behave yourself in the courtroom tomorrow, okay?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,45,Maya,Heh heh heh. Misbehaving's much more fun.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,46,Phoenix,It's not going to be so much fun when Edgeworth refuses to pay your bail again.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,47,Maya,... Right. I'll behave.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,48,Phoenix,(Oh dear...)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,49,Maya,"There aren't many cops around today, are there?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,50,Phoenix,"They're probably back at the precinct, working up the case against Edgeworth."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,51,Maya,Mmm...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,52,Lotta,Hey y'all!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,53,Maya,"Hey, it's Lotta!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,54,Lotta,Y'all really did it today...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,55,Phoenix,Wh-what did we do now?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,56,Lotta,"Naw, I'm not complaining! See, I did a little thinking. A little... self-reflection, you might say. I realized that bein' a witness is a mighty big responsibility. But I just went up there and started blabbing any old thing that came to mind."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,57,Phoenix,Lotta...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,58,Lotta,"So, you see, I want to make it up to y'all."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,59,Phoenix,"""Make it up""...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,60,Phoenix,What did you think of the trial?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,61,Lotta,"To be honest, I was doin' it half just to say I'd been a witness... Even though I didn't really see anything. I kinda convinced myself I had though... I'm sorry, I know I caused y'all a lot of trouble."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,62,Maya,"Well, memory is a tricky, vague little thing."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,63,Lotta,"Yeah, I sure know that now. I'll be fine the next time I witness a murder!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,64,Maya,Right!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,65,Phoenix,(You mean the FIRST time you witness a murder...)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,66,Phoenix,What about Gourdy?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,67,Lotta,"Right! Well, the way I figure, the trial's only stoking the flames of Gourdy fever! I'll get my exclusive photos and rocket to stardom!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,68,Maya,"All right, Lotta! You go, girl! I wish I could be an investigative photographer too!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,69,Phoenix,(Finish your spirit medium training first!)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,70,Phoenix,"Lotta, what do you mean by ""making it up to us""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,71,Lotta,"Well, ya see... Actually, I got a bit of information for you."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,72,Maya,What!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,73,Lotta,That von Karma didn't want me to say nothin' about it.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,74,Maya,Wh-what information!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,75,Lotta,"Now we're getting to the heart of it! See, I reckoned we might be able to do ourselves a little ""exchange."""
Turnabout goodbyes,3,76,Phoenix,"E-""exchange""? Umm... I thought this was to ""make it up to us""...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,77,Lotta,"Right! I propose a little exchange, to make it up to you!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,78,Phoenix,...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,79,Lotta,"What!? Information don't come cheap, my friend!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,80,Maya,Uh...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,81,Lotta,"Hey! I see you thinking ""my, how unsophisticated these southern folks are""!!! It's written all over yer face! Let me tell you, most southerners are WAY more sophisticated than you... I'm just the exception, okay? Well, what'll it be? We gonna deal, or not!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,82,Maya,"Wh-what should we do, Nick?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,83,Phoenix,(We don't have any other leads so I don't think we have a choice here...) Okay. How much?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,84,Lotta,"Huh? You completely off your rocker? I may not be sophisticated, but I'm not trying to rob the poor!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,85,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,86,Lotta,The only fair exchange for information is... information! Listen good-- What I need from you is information about Gourdy!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,87,Maya,Whoa-whoa-whoa! G-Gourdy!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,88,Phoenix,"B-but Gourdy doesn't... I mean, Gourdy might not exist!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,89,Lotta,Then bring me proof that shows he don't!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,90,Phoenix,Uh...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,91,Lotta,"I'll be keepin' watch from the car, okay? You see something, y'all come to me first, got it?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,92,Phoenix,O-okay...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,93,Lotta,Right! See y'all later!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,94,Phoenix,...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,95,Maya,"Okay, Nick, let's get hunting!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,96,Phoenix,H-hunting...? You don't seriously mean...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,97,Maya,Gourdy? I sure do!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,98,Phoenix,What about Edgeworth!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,99,Maya,"We're searching for Gourdy for him, Nick! Don't you get it!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,100,Phoenix,(Okay... and how exactly do we search for a make-believe monster...? Maybe we can find a monster myth specialist?)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,101,Phoenix,Wh-what's that?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,102,Maya,"Th-the Steel Samurai, Nick."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,103,Butz,Yo! Maya!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,104,Phoenix,Larry! What the heck is this!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,105,Butz,"Oh, it was my girl Kiyance's idea... She was all ""if you like, put this here, it would be, like, really cool!"" Dude, she gave it to me along with the banner!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,106,Maya,Wow! That's really impressive she could find those for you!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,107,Butz,"Well, she knows a lot of people. And that show's finished now, so she got 'em for free."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,108,Phoenix,Right...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,109,Butz,"Yo, Nick! What happened with Edgeworth?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,110,Phoenix,"Well, we made it through the first day in court all right... I don't know how good our prospects are from here on, though."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,111,Butz,Huh.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,112,Maya,"Hey, Larry, did you know Edgeworth's secret weakness? He's terrified of earthquakes! He acts like a little boy!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,113,Butz,Huh? That's weird. I don't think he was ever like that in school.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,114,Maya,No? Really?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,115,Butz,"Well, we were only in the same class for a year. He transferred schools pretty quickly..."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,116,Maya,Transferred?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,117,Phoenix,"(Right... when the DL-6 Incident happened. Doesn't look like Larry knows about it, though.)"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,118,Phoenix,"Hey, Larry. What was that big... thing up there before?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,119,Butz,"Huh? Oh, the big guy? I've had that for about a month, yeah. It's a big hit with the kids!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,120,Phoenix,Why wasn't it there yesterday?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,121,Butz,Huh? Huh!? Oh... right. Th-the compressor was busted.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,122,Maya,Compressor?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,123,Butz,Yeah--it's that little unit by my hotdog stand. That what I use to put air in the Steel Samurai! It broke a little while ago so I sent it in for repairs.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,124,Maya,Oh. And here I thought you'd inflated it by yourself.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,125,Lotta,Hey y'all! Well? Y'all find anything out about Gourdy?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,126,Maya,"Umm... no, nothing."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,127,Lotta,"Well, keep moving! It gets cold out here at nighttime."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,128,Maya,It is a little chilly... I... I think I have to sneeze!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,129,Lotta,Wh-whoa! No you don't! No sneezing!!!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,130,Maya,Whaaa-cho!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,131,_,klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik
Turnabout goodbyes,3,132,Maya,...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,133,Lotta,"I told y'all NO SNEEZING! See, I set the camera to respond to things a little softer than a ""bang."" It'd trigger on one of von Karma's finger snaps now!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,134,Maya,Oh... I'm sorry.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,135,Lotta,"Yeah, well, sorry's nice but what about my film!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,136,Maya,Nick... pay the lady.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,137,Phoenix,(*sob*)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,138,Maya,What are you going to do if Gourdy doesn't exist?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,139,Lotta,I'll quit being an investigative photographer.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,140,Maya,What!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,141,Lotta,"After all, I only have one photo to my name so far..."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,142,Maya,Was it a good one?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,143,Lotta,You bet... a yoofoh!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,144,Maya,A y-yoofoh...?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,145,Lotta,"Anyway, if I can't get a career-making photo this time around... Then that's it! I'll quit and go back to school."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,146,Maya,Huh? So you really are a university student?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,147,Lotta,"Yeah, well, I'm takin' a break for a bit."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,148,Maya,Right...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,149,Gumshoe,"Hey there, pal. What's up? You look out of sorts. Wait... you didn't go and do something that's going to hurt Mr. Edgeworth's case again!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,150,Phoenix,"What do you mean, ""again""!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,151,Gumshoe,"Whatever, have a seat, pal. I'm here for you if you need anything. Besides money, that is."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,152,Maya,"Say, Detective Gumshoe. Do you know ""Gourdy""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,153,Gumshoe,"The monster down in Gourd Lake? Not personally, no."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,154,Maya,Well... we're looking for him.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,155,Gumshoe,Huh!? Are you out of your minds!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,156,Maya,Eeek!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,157,Gumshoe,You got time to go wild monster hunting!? How about doing a little questioning for me then!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,158,Maya,"Oh... Detective Gumshoe is scaring me, Nick."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,159,Phoenix,I told Detective Gumshoe about the deal with Lotta.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,160,Maya,Nick! Try telling him sooner next time!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,161,Phoenix,"Er, sorry."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,162,Gumshoe,"... I see, pal. Sorry for shoutin' at you. ... Okay! I, Detective Gumshoe, will aid your search for Gourdy!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,163,Maya,H-huh!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,164,Gumshoe,I'll loan you one of newest secret weapons for finding evidence!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,165,Maya,Really!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,166,Gumshoe,You can take whichever one you like!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,167,Maya,"Okay, give us the goods!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,168,Gumshoe,"Hold on now, everything in due time. First, let me show 'em to you! These are our best and brightest! Introducing Secret Weapon No. 1: ""Missile""!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,169,Maya,M-M-Missile?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,170,Gumshoe,"He's a K-9 police dog, still in training! Missile! Missile! Here, boy..."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,171,Missile,Woof.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,172,Gumshoe,Here he is.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,173,Maya,"Hey, he's cute! Look, Nick! Cute dog!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,174,Phoenix,(A cute dog... And this will help us... how?)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,175,Missile,Woof.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,176,Gumshoe,"Next, Secret Weapon No. 2... A fishing pole! Here, this is my own personal pole."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,177,Phoenix,Detective Gumshoe... we're looking for a monster...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,178,Gumshoe,Yeah!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,179,Phoenix,How are we supposed to catch a whole sea monster with a fishing pole!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,180,Gumshoe,"Never know 'til you try, pal!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,181,Phoenix,...!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,182,Gumshoe,"Okay, this next one is the last one."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,183,Phoenix,"(No, please, I'm already overwhelmed by our choices.)"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,184,Gumshoe,Secret Weapon No. 3! A metal detector! Here.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,185,Phoenix,Detective Gumshoe... we're looking for something alive.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,186,Gumshoe,Right!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,187,Phoenix,How are we supposed to find it with a metal detector!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,188,Gumshoe,"Hey, you never know! It might have been eating soda cans! Well, which will it be!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,189,Maya,"Umm... I can't make up my mind, Nick. They all seem so perfect!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,190,Phoenix,"I can't make up my mind, either... for the totally opposite reason. (Oh well, I suppose it can't hurt to borrow one of them.)"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,191,Phoenix,Can we borrow that metal detector?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,192,Gumshoe,"Sure thing, pal."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,193,Phoenix,I'm not sure what we're going to find with this...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,194,Gumshoe,Remember: you're hunting for a monster. Anything is possible! Anything!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,195,Maya,N-Nick! It's beeping! The metal detector's found something!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,196,Phoenix,"Sure it loud enough about it. (Whatever it is, it must be in those bushes...) Go check it out, Maya."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,197,Maya,Why do I have to check it out? ... Nick. Look!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,198,Phoenix,Huh...? An air tank? Huh. The valve looks broken.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,199,Maya,I thought it was Gourdy...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,200,Phoenix,"Maya, first of all... Why would Gourdy be in the bushes!? And second of all, why would a metal detector react to a sea monster!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,201,Maya,Oh.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,202,Phoenix,Huh? (There's something wrapped around this air tank... It looks like... a string of flags...?)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,203,Maya,"Well, we might as well take it with us now that we've found it."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,204,Phoenix,(It's heavy...)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,205,Phoenix,Hmm... Detective Gumshoe isn't here...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,206,Maya,"Now that you mention it, didn't he say he had a meeting to go to?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,207,Phoenix,"Ah, that's right... Let's come back later."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,208,Maya,"Umm... So, the tank and the Steel Samurai you were trying to fill up flew away... What happened next?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,209,Butz,"Well, all that happened on the 20th or so."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,210,Phoenix,(The 20th... a week ago.)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,211,Butz,"Now, as far as I could see, the tank went flying out into the lake. So I went out every night in a boat looking for it. I mean, Kiyance gave me that Steel Samurai after all!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,212,Maya,And when did you find it?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,213,Butz,Just the night before last! It flew way out there! Took me four whole days to find it.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,214,Phoenix,(The night before last... was the night of the murder!)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,215,Butz,"Sorry for not telling you, Nick. Actually, I was here on the night of the murder. But, you see, I went home before midnight."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,216,Maya,So you didn't know about what happened?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,217,Butz,No...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,218,Maya,That's too bad...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,219,Phoenix,It's not all bad. We've solved one mystery at least.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,220,Maya,A mystery...?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,221,Phoenix,(Maybe we should go tell her...)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,222,Lotta,"Well, Mister Lawyer? I've got the info y'all need! Y'all got the scoop on Gourdy for me yet?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,223,Phoenix,Lotta... There is no such thing as Gourdy.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,224,Lotta,Wh-what!? How can y'all be so sure!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,225,Maya,"R-really, Nick!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,226,Lotta,Y'all got some proof Gourdy don't exist!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,227,Phoenix,The proof that Gourdy doesn't exist...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,228,Phoenix,Of course I have proof. No lawyer worth his badge would make a claim without proof to back it up. Here's the proof that Gourdy doesn't exist...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,229,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,3,230,Maya,Larry's air tank...?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,231,Lotta,What're y'all doing with an air tank?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,232,Phoenix,This... is Gourdy.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,233,Lotta,Umm... scuze me?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,234,Maya,"Wh-what exactly are you saying, Nick?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,235,Phoenix,"There's a stand near here... a hotdog stand. There's a giant inflatable samurai doll there. About a week ago, an idiot, who happens to be a friend of mine, tried to fill it. He used this air tank, and when the valve blew, the tank flew into the lake. Apparently, it made a pretty loud ""bang"" when it flew..."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,236,Lotta,"A ""bang""...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,237,Phoenix,"The tank, along with the still deflated Samurai fell into the lake. At the same time... A couple was taking a photograph of the lake. This photo!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,238,Maya,Wait... So... you're saying that Gourdy... Is really the Steel Samurai!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,239,Lotta,"... ... Well, that's a fine way to ruin a gal's dreams."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,240,Phoenix,"I'm sorry, Lotta."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,241,Lotta,"Nah, it's okay, you win. I'll give you your info, like I promised."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,242,Maya,Poor Lotta...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,243,Phoenix,"So, tell us this ""information"" you have."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,244,Lotta,"A promise is a promise, I guess... I overheard the cops around here saying something about the witness tomorrow... They said he's the caretaker of the boat rental place up the path here."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,245,Maya,"Boat rental...? There's someone there? I mean, it looks so deserted."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,246,Lotta,"Just an old guy, living all by himself. Y'all should go check it out."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,247,Maya,"Thanks, Lotta! We will! Let's get cracking, Nick!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,248,Lotta,Hold on.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,249,Phoenix,Something else?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,250,Lotta,"Yeah... the night of the murder. My camera clicked twice, you know."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,251,Maya,...! Wait... so you have another photo?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,252,Lotta,"Well... Yeah, but there's nothing in it at all. Just the lake. I figured it wouldn't be much use as evidence, so I kept it to myself. Well, it might not be helpful at all, but... Here, take it."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,253,Lotta,Bye now. Y'all take care. Time for me to pack up and leave.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,254,Maya,... Poor Lotta...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,255,Phoenix,"It's all Larry's fault. The legend still lives on, I guess."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,256,Maya,"The ""legend""...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,257,Phoenix,"Yeah, the legend of Larry, familiar to all who know him for any length of time... ""When something smells, it's usually the Butz."""
Turnabout goodbyes,3,258,Maya,Hmm. Someone should whip that Butz into shape.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,259,Maya,"Hey, Nick! This is the boat shop that Lotta was talking about!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,260,Phoenix,You're right. Doesn't seem to be anyone around at all.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,261,Maya,"Well, let's go check it out anyway!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,262,Uncle,Meg! That you!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,263,Maya,Eeeek!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,264,Uncle,"Hey, is that Keith with you!? Where have you two been! I've been worried sick."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,265,Maya,... N-Nick... you handle this.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,266,Phoenix,"Uh, I think I'll leave this one up to you, Maya."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,267,Uncle,Meg!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,268,Maya,Y-yes!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,269,Uncle,"Finally made up your mind, have you?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,270,Maya,M-my mind?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,271,Uncle,You'll run the pasta shop when I'm gone?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,272,Maya,P-pasta?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,273,Uncle,"Glad to hear it, glad to hear it! You make your old man proud. When you kids left the house, I didn't know what to think. How'm I supposed to keep this place running, an old man like me? Polly! The kids are home!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,274,Parrot,"""Hello! Hello!"" *squawk*"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,275,Maya,N-Nick! What was that!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,276,Phoenix,A parrot... the one on the perch.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,277,Uncle,Keith!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,278,Phoenix,Y-yes!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,279,Uncle,"I leave the ""Wet Noodle"" in your capable hands, sonny."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,280,Maya,"N-Nick? What's the ""Wet Noodle""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,281,Phoenix,"Um, based on the available evidence, I'd say it's the name of his pasta shop."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,282,Uncle,"That's a relief, isn't it, Polly?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,283,Parrot,"""Hello! Hello!"" *squawk*"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,284,Uncle,Ayup... ... *Zzzzz*
Turnabout goodbyes,3,285,Maya,He fell asleep...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,286,Phoenix,I guess he's relieved.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,287,Uncle,*Zzzzz*
Turnabout goodbyes,3,288,Phoenix,Umm... a pasta shop?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,289,Uncle,"Ayup! To think, the ""Wet Noodle,"" will live on when I'm gone! My father started it you know. So that makes you two the third generation! Meg..."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,290,Maya,Y-yes!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,291,Uncle,"Tomorrow, we'll start with the secrets of dough tossin'!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,292,Maya,D-dough tossing?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,293,Uncle,"You, too, Keith."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,294,Phoenix,Y-yes?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,295,Uncle,You'll be the best pasta wrangler the west has ever seen!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,296,Maya,P-pasta wrangler? The west? I-isn't pasta from Italy?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,297,Uncle,Meg!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,298,Maya,Y-yes!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,299,Uncle,"You know the best pasta's always been made west of the Rockies, don't you?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,300,Phoenix,"R-right, of course. Everybody knows that."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,301,Maya,Nick...?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,302,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,303,Maya,How long do we have to keep up this all-in-the-family charade?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,304,Phoenix,(This old man must know something about the murder...! We're not leaving until we find out what that is.)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,305,Uncle,*Zzzzz*
Turnabout goodbyes,3,306,Phoenix,"Umm... this is a boat rental shop, right?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,307,Uncle,"What're you talking about!? This here's the palace of pasta, the ""Wet Noodle""! Though, now that you mention it, we haven't gotten many orders for spaghetti lately. All the kids come up and say ""Yo dude, we wanna ride in one of your boats!"" That's why I keep them boats out there. Youngsters these days... Darned if I understand 'em!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,308,Phoenix,I'm pretty confused myself.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,309,Maya,Nick... This isn't going anywhere.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,310,Phoenix,"But this old man is the witness tomorrow, right? We've got to find some way of getting information out of him!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,311,Phoenix,"Umm... this is a boat rental shop, right?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,312,Uncle,"What're you talking about!? This here's the palace of pasta, the ""Wet Noodle""! Though, now that you mention it, we haven't gotten many orders for spaghetti lately. All the kids come up and say ""Yo dude, we wanna ride in one of your boats!"" That's why I keep them boats out there. Youngsters these days... Darned if I understand 'em!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,313,Phoenix,I'm pretty confused myself.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,314,Maya,Nick... This isn't going anywhere.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,315,Phoenix,"But this old man is the witness tomorrow, right? We've got to find some way of getting information out of him!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,316,Maya,Wow... what an amazing parrot that is. Good morning!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,317,Parrot,"""..."""
Turnabout goodbyes,3,318,Maya,Hello!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,319,Parrot,"""..."""
Turnabout goodbyes,3,320,Maya,He ignored me!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,321,Uncle,*Zzzzz*
Turnabout goodbyes,3,322,Uncle,"What, you forgot, Meg? You gotta call her name first!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,323,Maya,Her name?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,324,Uncle,Polly! How ya been!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,325,Parrot,"""Hello! Hello!"" *squawk*"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,326,Uncle,See?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,327,Maya,"Neat! So the parrot's name is ""Polly""!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,328,Maya,"Too bad all she can say is ""hello""..."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,329,Uncle,Har har har! Old Polly can say lots of things! You just need to know the secret words!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,330,Maya,"The ""secret words""...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,331,Maya,Polly! Polly! What's your name?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,332,Parrot,"""Pol-ly!"" *squawk*"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,333,Maya,Hee hee! Cute!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,334,Phoenix,(Maya's found a new friend.)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,335,Uncle,*Zzzzz* ...! That a lawyer's badge?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,336,Phoenix,"Y-yes, it is! (I don't believe it! This old guy is the first person to recognize my badge!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,337,Uncle,... I get it.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,338,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,339,Uncle,Ayup... I got you figured out now! You're not Keith!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,340,Phoenix,...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,341,Maya,N-Nick! Now's our chance to clear things up!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,342,Phoenix,"Umm... sir. No, I'm not Keith."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,343,Maya,"And I'm not Meg, either!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,344,Uncle,...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,345,Phoenix,We're here investigating a murder that took place on this lake the other night.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,346,Maya,"Please, help us!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,347,Uncle,"... Hmm... a lawyer, huh?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,348,Maya,"Please, mister..."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,349,Uncle,"Alright, I'll help. But, on one condition."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,350,Maya,What's that?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,351,Uncle,"When this case is over and done... You'll run the ""Wet Noodle""!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,352,Phoenix,"Okay, we promise."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,353,Maya,N-Nick! Are you sure about this?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,354,Phoenix,"Hey, anything to get the case solved. Also... Who wouldn't want to eat ""Phoenix Noodles""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,355,Maya,I... guess so.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,356,Uncle,"That's my boy! Good for you, Keith."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,357,Phoenix,"W-wait, didn't I just say..."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,358,Uncle,"You, too, Meg!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,359,Maya,Y-yes!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,360,Uncle,"Heh heh heh... you bring a tear to your old man's eye, you know. Now, what was that you wanted to know? Speak up, Polly!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,361,Parrot,"""Hello! Hello!"" *squawk*"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,362,Maya,Er...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,363,Phoenix,(Now he's talking to the bird again! How do we get him to talk to us!?)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,364,Uncle,"Ayup, I seen this."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,365,Phoenix,"Y-you know something about this, sir!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,366,Uncle,Keith.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,367,Phoenix,Y-yes?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,368,Uncle,It's okay. You can call me Dad.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,369,Phoenix,... D-Dad! You know something about this!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,370,Uncle,Ayup. The other night... out on the lake...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,371,Maya,Yes? Yes!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,372,Uncle,I know all about that! I seen it.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,373,Maya,Whaaaat!? Tell us! Tell what you saw!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,374,Uncle,"Well, I suppose. Since you're taking over the shop and all..."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,375,Uncle,"I forget the time, but it was pretty dark outside... probably night, ayup."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,376,Phoenix,"(It was after midnight, but okay...)"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,377,Uncle,"Then I heard this ""bang!"" So I looked outside. Then I heard another one. ""Bang!"" A little while later, this boat comes back. Then a young man walked by my window here. He was mutterin' something to himself, ayup."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,378,Maya,What did he say?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,379,Uncle,"... Ayup... ... I forgot. I'll remember tomorrow by court time, promise."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,380,Maya,We need to know earlier than that...!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,381,Uncle,You know what? Eh? Little Terry was just here.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,382,Phoenix,"""Terry""...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,383,Uncle,"Ayup, that kid next door. You always used to make him cry, remember? He was wearin' this tattered old coat. Got himself some whiskers growing out of his face."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,384,Phoenix,(He must be talking about Detective Gumshoe...)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,385,Uncle,He comes up and tells me to come down to court tomorrow.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,386,Maya,Really...?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,387,Phoenix,(Somehow I don't think we're going to get much useful information out of this guy.) Maya... maybe we should be leaving.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,388,Maya,"I think you're right. Oh, wait--I had one more question."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,389,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,390,Maya,Polly! Polly! Have we forgotten something?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,391,Parrot,"*squawk* ""Don't forget DL-6!"" *squawk*"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,392,Maya,"H-huh!? What did she just say, Nick?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,393,Phoenix,"One more time, Polly!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,394,Parrot,"""Don't forget DL-6!"" *squawk*"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,395,Phoenix,"(What!? The DL-6 Incident?) Hey, mister! I-I mean, Dad!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,396,Uncle,*Zzzzz*
Turnabout goodbyes,3,397,Phoenix,(This is getting weird... Who IS this old guy!?)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,398,Maya,Why would that bird Polly know about DL-6...?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,399,Phoenix,We have to figure out who that old man is.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,400,Maya,Oh...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,401,Phoenix,What?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,402,Maya,"He locked the door, from the other side."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,403,Phoenix,(... Who could that old man be...? I think I need to do a little more research on this DL-6 Incident... Maybe I should ask Detective Gumshoe.)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,404,Gumshoe,"Hey, pal! Long time no see! ... You don't look so happy. What's wrong this time?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,405,Phoenix,"Actually, we wanted to ask you something..."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,406,Gumshoe,Yeah?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,407,Phoenix,You know the boat rental shop down at Gourd Lake?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,408,Gumshoe,"Oh, yeah..."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,409,Phoenix,"The old man who runs it is appearing as a witness in court tomorrow, right?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,410,Gumshoe,Huh...!? How'd you-- Hmm. That was supposed to be top secret.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,411,Maya,"Do you know who that old man is, Detective?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,412,Gumshoe,... Actually... I don't. He's a bit of an odd bird... I haven't been able to get a straight answer out of him. I decided first that he wasn't persuasive enough to stand and testify as a witness. That's why we called Ms. Lotta Hart yesterday. As for who he is... We have absolutely no idea.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,413,Maya,Hmm... sounds suspicious!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,414,Gumshoe,Hmm...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,415,Phoenix,"Detective Gumshoe, please, help us..."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,416,Gumshoe,H-huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,417,Phoenix,We need to know about the DL-6 Incident!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,418,Gumshoe,...!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,419,Phoenix,That was when Edgeworth's father died. I can't help but think that it has something to do with this current case.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,420,Gumshoe,"... To tell the truth, I don't know much about DL-6 either. Mr. Edgeworth forbade us from reading the file. So... I'm afraid I can't show them to you, either, pal."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,421,Maya,What!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,422,Gumshoe,"However... If you can convince me somehow that the DL-6 Incident is related to this case... Well, I guess I'd consider opening the file up."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,423,Gumshoe,What's that? A parrot?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,424,Phoenix,"The old man at the boat rental shop's parrot. The parrot knew about that ""incident""..."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,425,Gumshoe,That incident?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,426,Phoenix,DL-6.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,427,Gumshoe,Wh-what!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,428,Maya,Polly! Polly! Have we forgotten something?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,429,Parrot,"*squawk* ""Don't forget DL-6!"" *squawk*"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,430,Maya,H-huh!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,431,Phoenix,I'm pretty sure that old man must have taught her that word...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,432,Gumshoe,"Yeah, but how would that old man know about the DL-6 Incident?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,433,Phoenix,Wait! What if... What if that old man was connected to DL-6?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,434,Maya,N-Nick! You think he might be!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,435,Gumshoe,...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,436,Gumshoe,... I get ya. Sounds like you need information on the DL-6 Incident. Through there is the Station's Records Room. I'll give you special permission to go in and find what you need.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,437,Maya,"All right! Way to go, Detective Gumshoe! Okay, Nick! To the Records Room!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,438,Phoenix,(I guess it's time we faced Edgeworth's past...)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,439,Maya,Wow!!! It's amazing.........ly dusty.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,440,Phoenix,"Ten years of files and ten years of dust, I guess."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,441,Maya,Let's find that DL-6 stuff quick!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,442,Phoenix,(Fifteen years ago... both me and Edgeworth were nine years old. We were almost through with fourth grade when he suddenly transferred. Because of DL-6...?)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,443,Maya,Nick! I found out where the file is!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,444,Phoenix,"O-oh, thanks!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,445,Maya,Just let me know what you want to know about the DL-6 Incident! I'll go get the right file!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,446,Phoenix,"Well, first I have to get a handle on the main facts... like a summary."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,447,Maya,Right. Summary... summary... Found it! Here you go.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,448,Phoenix,December 28... 2001.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,449,Maya,That's exactly 15 years ago from the day after tomorrow!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,450,Phoenix,"(So in two days, the case is closed...) The incident took place in the elevator of the district court."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,451,Maya,What!? Is this the same district court where we're holding the trial now!?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,452,Phoenix,"Looks like it. There was a large earthquake at 2:00 PM on that day. Part of the court building collapsed, and all of the lights went out."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,453,Maya,Wow... that was some earthquake!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,454,Phoenix,"At the time, three people were trapped in the elevator. It took five hours for them to be rescued... Five hours!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,455,Maya,"That would be scary like that, in the dark!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,456,Phoenix,"There was a lack of oxygen in the elevator, and the survivors were unconscious."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,457,Maya,The survivors...?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,458,Phoenix,One of the three in the elevator had been shot... in the heart.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,459,Maya,That was Mr. Edgeworth's father... wasn't it.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,460,Phoenix,(He said that his father was shot before his very eyes... So Miles Edgeworth was one of the other passengers in that elevator.)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,461,Phoenix,Do you have data on the victim... Edgeworth's father?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,462,Maya,"Yeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,463,Phoenix,"Gregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he'd be 50. He had lost that day's case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,464,Maya,"""Miles""...!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,465,Phoenix,"Miles Edgeworth, of course."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,466,Maya,So he was on the elevator with his father!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,467,Phoenix,"From the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What's going on here?)"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,468,Phoenix,Got any data on the suspect in there?
Turnabout goodbyes,3,469,Maya,Hmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,470,Phoenix,"The man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,471,Maya,"So he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it!"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,472,Phoenix,"But... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,473,Maya,Hammond... the victim in our case!
Turnabout goodbyes,3,474,Phoenix,"Right. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared."
Turnabout goodbyes,3,475,Maya,"Hmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder?"
Turnabout goodbyes,3,476,Phoenix,(He may be closer than we think...)
Turnabout goodbyes,3,477,Phoenix,I guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,478,Maya,Nick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out.
Turnabout goodbyes,3,479,Phoenix,Y-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need...
Turnabout goodbyes,3,480,Phoenix,"Right. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how ""Dad"" will do testifying in court..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,0,Judge,Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,1,Phoenix,"The defense is ready, Your Honor."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,2,Karma,... ...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,3,Judge,"Very well, apparently the prosecution is also ready."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,4,Phoenix,"(Who is the judge here, anyway!?)"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,5,Judge,"Mr. von Karma, your opening statement."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,6,Karma,... ...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,7,Judge,"Er... very well, no opening statement so..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,8,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,9,Karma,"Not so fast, Judge! I was taking a meaningful pause before speaking!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,10,Judge,"R-right, of course."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,11,Karma,A prediction! Today's trial will end three minutes from now!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,12,Judge,Order... order! Mr. von Karma! What is the meaning of your statement just now!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,13,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,14,Karma,Bah! Must you question everything! It will be over in three minutes! We have no time to waste! I'll call my witness now!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,15,Judge,R-right...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,16,Karma,I call my witness... my decisive witness to the stand!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,17,Phoenix,(It's that mysterious boat shop owner.)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,18,Karma,Witness... state your profession.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,19,Uncle,"Mmph... zzzz... ... I, er, am the proprietor of the restaurant the ""Wet Noodle"" at Gourd Lake."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,20,Karma,...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,21,Uncle,"And I, er, also rent boats."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,22,Karma,"The night of the incident, you were in the boat rental shop, correct?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,23,Uncle,"Er... ayup, yup I was."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,24,Karma,Please testify.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,25,Phoenix,(Wait a second... We still haven't heard who this old guy is!)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,26,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,27,Phoenix,Wait a minute! The witness hasn't stated his name yet!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,28,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,29,Karma,"Because I did not ask him, Mr. Wright! Bah! I have predicted this trial will end in three minutes! Stop asking trivial questions and cooperate!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,30,Phoenix,"(Yeah, right!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,31,Judge,The witness will state his name.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,32,Uncle,"Zzzz... ... Mmph! Well, er... I'm not really sure, ayup."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,33,Judge,What do you mean?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,34,Uncle,"My, er, memory..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,35,Karma,"Your honor... The witness does not remember anything beyond the last several years... Ergo, he cannot recall his own name."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,36,Judge,"Hmm... he can't recall, you say?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,37,Karma,"Yes, but the incident in question took place three days ago. He can testify."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,38,Judge,"Very well. Let's hear his testimony then, shall we. Witness?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,39,Judge,Hmm...Very well. I'd like to begin the cross-examination...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,40,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,41,Karma,"There is nothing to question in my witness's testimony! Ergo, no need for cross-examination! Besides, there are only 10 seconds left before our three minutes are up! Judge! Your verdict, now!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,42,Judge,Er... yes... M-Mr. Wright...?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,43,Phoenix,What are you saying!? Of course I'll cross-examine the witness!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,44,Judge,"Hmm... Very well, you may begin."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,45,Karma,Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,46,Judge,E-excuse me? Mr. von Karma?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,47,Karma,Three minutes just passed.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,48,Judge,"I see. Well then, let's just take our time. You may cross-examine the witness."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,49,Uncle,"It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,50,Phoenix,"""Just after midnight,"" you say?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,51,Uncle,"Ayup, just around then."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,52,Phoenix,Are you sure?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,53,Uncle,"Pretty sure, ayup."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,54,Phoenix,"When I talked to you yesterday, you were rather vague about the time... I'm surprised you seem so sure about it today."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,55,Uncle,...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,56,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,57,Karma,"I asked him, and he remembered. Isn't that right!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,58,Uncle,"Zzzz... D-don't glare at me like that...! I, er... I remembered it clearly, I did. Ayup."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,59,Karma,You see? Continue!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,60,Uncle,"I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,61,Phoenix,Is there anyone who can verify that?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,62,Uncle,"... Well, I guess Polly could."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,63,Phoenix,Th-that's not good enough for a court of law!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,64,Judge,Mr. Wright... exactly what's not good enough?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,65,Phoenix,"Ah, uh, Your Honor, this ""Polly"" is a parrot."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,66,Judge,A... parrot?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,67,Uncle,"Don't be so hard on the girl, Keithy-boy!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,68,Judge,Keith...?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,69,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,70,Karma,The prosecution concedes that we cannot prove the witness was in the shop. Witness... please continue.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,71,Uncle,"Then I heard a ""bang!"" Ayup."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,72,Phoenix,"And where did the ""bang"" seem to come from?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,73,Uncle,"From the lake, I figure."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,74,Karma,Are you certain?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,75,Uncle,A-ayup.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,76,Karma,Good. Continue!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,77,Uncle,"When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,78,Phoenix,Was there someone in the boat?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,79,Uncle,"It was pretty far out there... I couldn't see clearly... But I figure there was two men out there, ayup."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,80,Phoenix,But you couldn't see them clearly!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,81,Uncle,"Ayup... at the time, that is."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,82,Phoenix,(At the time...?)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,83,Uncle,"Then I heard another ""bang."""
Turnabout goodbyes,4,84,Phoenix,So you heard two gunshots total?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,85,Uncle,Ayup.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,86,Phoenix,(That's what Lotta said in her testimony yesterday.)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,87,Uncle,"Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,88,Phoenix,"""By your window""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,89,Uncle,"Ayup, by my window. Right outside the window of my little shack."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,90,Phoenix,"And, could you see the man's face?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,91,Uncle,"Well, the fog was pretty darn thick, but he was right there in front of me. I saw him."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,92,Judge,This is rather important detail! Please add it to your testimony.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,93,Uncle,...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,94,Karma,"Tsk, tsk, tsk..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,95,Phoenix,(I have a bad feeling about this...)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,96,Uncle,"That man was the defendant... he was saying ""I can't believe he's dead."""
Turnabout goodbyes,4,97,Phoenix,A-are you sure!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,98,Uncle,...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,99,Phoenix,(Uh oh!) D-Dad!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,100,Uncle,"Dead certain, Keith! He said ""I can't believe he's dead"" as he was walking by, too."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,101,Karma,Witness! Are you sure that the person you saw was Miles Edgeworth!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,102,Uncle,It was him! That Edgeworth boy!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,103,Judge,... This... sounds like decisive evidence indeed. I see no room for doubt.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,104,Phoenix,(von Karma... He lured me into cross-examining so he could set me up for a fall!)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,105,Karma,"Tsk, tsk, tsk..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,106,Maya,N-Nick...! I don't like the way things are going here! Everyone in the courtroom is glaring at us!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,107,Phoenix,"(I'd better act quick, or this trial is going to be over!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,108,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,109,Phoenix,Your Honor! We proved in yesterday's court that it could not have been Edgeworth who fired the gun!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,110,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,111,Karma,"Mr. Wright. Are you referring to the fingerprints from Edgeworth's right hand found on the gun, and the photograph showing a man firing with his left hand...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,112,Phoenix,Exactly!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,113,Karma,That is easily explainable! He could have wiped his prints after he fired! You are ignoring the truth of the matter here! Everything in this witness's testimony is true!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,114,Judge,Hmm...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,115,Phoenix,(The judge is lost in thought... what should I do?)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,116,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,117,Phoenix,"Your Honor! This witness claims that Edgeworth said ""I can' t believe he's dead""... But his word is all we have! If he were telling a lie..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,118,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,119,Karma,"Mr. Wright. In a court of law, the evidence tells all. Apparently, you have yet to realize even this basic fact. If you say his testimony is a lie, show us proof!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,120,Phoenix,Urk...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,121,Maya,Nick! Do we have evidence...?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,122,Phoenix,It's no good! There's nothing I can do.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,123,Maya,A... are you sure?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,124,Phoenix,To be honest... I don't know what to do anymore.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,125,Maya,"Please... Can you hear me, Sis? Please... We need your help... Nick needs you..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,126,Karma,"Tsk tsk tsk... Three minutes was perhaps too high an expectation. However, fifteen minutes isn't bad! This must be a new record."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,127,Judge,Enough! The witness may leave the stand.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,128,Uncle,Zzzz...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,129,Judge,This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,130,Phoenix,(W-what!? No!)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,131,Karma,Hmph.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,132,Judge,"This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,133,Judge,Guilty
Turnabout goodbyes,4,134,Judge,"The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,135,Butz,W-w-waaaaaaait!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,136,Judge,Wh-who was that just now?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,137,Butz,Me!!!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,138,Phoenix,Huh? Waaaaah! L-Larry!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,139,Judge,Wh-what are you doing here!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,140,Butz,"Listen! Y-you gotta listen to me! I... I was... I was there, in the park, the night of the murder! I... I wasn't sure about it until just yesterday. B-but today I remembered it!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,141,Judge,Remembered what?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,142,Butz,The gunshot! I heard it too!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,143,Judge,O-order!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,144,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,145,Karma,What is the meaning of this!? The verdict has been decided! I call for adjournment!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,146,Judge,"One moment, Mr. von Karma. So, you say you heard a gunshot?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,147,Butz,"Yeah, I did! A gunshot! That night! I was sitting here in the audience, listening to the testimony... Then I realized, something he said was different from what I remember! A-anyhow, I can't just sit here and let you call Edgey a murderer! It's... It's just not right! I'll testify! Lemme testify!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,148,Judge,"Order! Order! Well, this is the first time something has happened like this in my court. I'm not quite sure how to proceed..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,149,Karma,Judge! You've already given your decision! The trial is over!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,150,Maya,Nick! This is it! Larry's given us one final chance at this!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,151,Phoenix,(She's right! If only it wasn't Larry... He could make things even worse...)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,152,Maya,"Mr. Edgeworth was just declared guilty, Nick! It doesn't get any worse!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,153,Phoenix,"You're right! Okay! Your Honor! If there is another witness, it is our duty to hear him speak! Right here! Right now!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,154,Karma,A waste of time! The verdict cannot be overturned!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,155,Judge,"Hmm... ... ... Allow me to speak my opinion. In all court proceedings, it is our duty to prevent an inaccurate verdict. In order to make sure no mistake has been made, every witness should be heard!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,156,Karma,Wh-what is this!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,157,Judge,"I withdraw my previous verdict of ""guilty""! Mr. von Karma! I order you to call this new witness to testify. Now!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,158,Karma,Whaaaat!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,159,Judge,"The court will adjourn for a five minute recess. After that, we will hear this new witness. Court is adjourned!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,160,Phoenix,"Whew... That was too close. Sorry to keep you on the edge of your seat like that, Edgeworth."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,161,Edgeworth,Hmph. I've seen worse.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,162,Phoenix,"(Yeah right, Edgeworth. You're sweating bullets!) I just wonder what Larry plans to say in there."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,163,Maya,Larry was at the lake that night?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,164,Phoenix,Yes... He said he went looking for the Steel Samurai balloon that flew into the lake.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,165,Maya,Oh right. And he found the balloon and the air tank that night?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,166,Phoenix,Yeah.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,167,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,168,Phoenix,"Hey, Edgeworth."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,169,Edgeworth,"... Huh? You say something, Wright?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,170,Phoenix,"Yeah, a lot of things. You seem out of it. What's wrong?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,171,Edgeworth,It... it's nothing.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,172,Phoenix,Hmm?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,173,Maya,Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? There's something I've been meaning to ask you.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,174,Edgeworth,What's that?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,175,Maya,Why are your fingerprints on the murder weapon?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,176,Edgeworth,"Oh. When he fell into the lake, I went into a daze. I couldn't understand what had happened. I couldn't think straight. Then I saw the pistol lying on the floor of the boat in front of me. I picked it up without thinking. I didn't have a reason, really."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,177,Maya,I see...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,178,Edgeworth,Wright...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,179,Phoenix,Yeah?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,180,Edgeworth,This might be our chance.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,181,Phoenix,Our chance?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,182,Edgeworth,von Karma has only ever run perfect trials.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,183,Phoenix,Perfect trials...?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,184,Edgeworth,"Perfectly prepared witnesses, perfectly complete evidence. That's the secret to his success. This is the first time he's ever had to deal with something unexpected! He has let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court! And that someone... is Larry!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,185,Phoenix,What are you getting at?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,186,Edgeworth,"It's likely his testimony will be full of holes, Wright."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,187,Maya,"That's right, Nick! No ten minute trial this time! We'll milk this one for all it's worth!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,188,Phoenix,"Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything depends on Larry now...)"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,189,Judge,Court is now back in session. Witness... Please testify to the court about everything that you saw... on the night of December 24th.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,190,Butz,Right... leave it to me!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,191,Phoenix,"(Please, Larry, don't mess this one up!!! I hate to admit it, but you're our last chance!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,192,Karma,...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,193,Phoenix,(von Karma didn't even have time to prep his witness. I just hope Edgeworth is right about this being our big break...)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,194,Judge,"Hmm... That was an unusually vague testimony, even for this court. In any matter, Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,195,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,196,Maya,"What's wrong, Nick?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,197,Phoenix,It's Larry! I have no idea what he's going to say if I press him. I'm a little scared.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,198,Maya,"Hmm... Well, we've come this far. There's no way to go but forward, Nick!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,199,Butz,"That night, I was out in a boat on the lake."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,200,Phoenix,...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,201,Judge,"Something wrong, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,202,Phoenix,There were so many things wrong I don't know where to begin...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,203,Judge,Ah...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,204,Phoenix,"Um, well, okay. First of all, what time was it?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,205,Butz,"Oh, it was after 11:00 when I went out in the boat. By that time everyone had gone home for the night. So I waited until the coast was clear, so to speak."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,206,Phoenix,And why were you out on a boat at such a late hour...?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,207,Butz,"I was looking for something and I, er, found it."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,208,Phoenix,"""Looking for something""...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,209,Butz,"Er, yeah."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,210,Judge,"Mr. Butz, what was it you were looking for?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,211,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,212,Karma,"What the witness was searching for is irrelevant! Most likely he was hunting for this ""Gourdy""!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,213,Phoenix,"(You know, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if that was the truth.)"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,214,Karma,This is all irrelevant! Let's get it over with.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,215,Butz,So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,216,Phoenix,Around what time was that?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,217,Butz,"Uh... Well, let's see... I figured I was out searching for about an hour... I guess it was around 12:00. Yeah."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,218,Judge,You're not sure?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,219,Butz,"Hey! Don't give me that face! I'm not some sort of human sundial, okay!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,220,Phoenix,"(People use watches these days, Larry...)"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,221,Butz,"Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this ""bang""!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,222,Phoenix,Where did the sound come from?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,223,Butz,"Yeah, well, I wasn't too sure about that. I looked around, y'know."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,224,Judge,Did you look at the lake?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,225,Butz,"Yeah, I looked."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,226,Butz,"I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,227,Phoenix,Wasn't there a boat on the lake!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,228,Judge,Order! Order! Well? Mr. Butz!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,229,Butz,"Whoa, whoa. Everybody just calm down, okay? I mean, it was real foggy that night. I'm not sure whether there was a boat out there or not."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,230,Phoenix,"(Oh, okay, no problem. That's just the MOST IMPORTANT PART of the case!!!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,231,Karma,Hmph!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,232,Butz,So after I heard that single gunshot I went home.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,233,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,234,Phoenix,"So, you only heard one ""bang"" correct?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,235,Butz,Yeah.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,236,Phoenix,(Huh.)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,237,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,238,Phoenix,"W-wait a sec, Larry!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,239,Butz,Wh-what!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,240,Phoenix,"You only heard one ""bang""!? You're sure!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,241,Butz,That's what I said!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,242,Phoenix,"But Mr. Lotta Hart testified yesterday that she heard two ""bang""s! And the old man just now said the same thing! They both heard two gunshots that night!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,243,Butz,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,244,Phoenix,Were you even listening!? Were you paying attention at all to what they said?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,245,Butz,"Yo, Nick, please!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,246,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,247,Butz,"You know, something's been bothering me. I'm a witness, see? I'm like a customer here! So you got to treat me nice and stuff, okay!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,248,Phoenix,...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,249,Judge,Mr. Butz.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,250,Butz,What!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,251,Judge,You only heard one gunshot? Are you sure?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,252,Butz,"... Umm... Well, to tell ya the truth... I'm not sure."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,253,Judge,Eh...?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,254,Phoenix,Not sure!? H-how could you not be sure?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,255,Butz,"Yeah, well... I, uh, I might have missed the other gunshot. I was, uh, listening to something else..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,256,Phoenix,Something... else?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,257,Butz,"My radio, dude! On my headphones."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,258,Phoenix,Whaaaaaaat!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,259,Judge,Order! Order! And stop that booing! M-Mr. Butz! You were listening to a radio on earphones?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,260,Butz,Y-yeah! So what! That a crime!? I listen to my radio! Everybody listens to the radio! What's the big deal!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,261,Judge,Hmm... Mr. von Karma... your opinion?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,262,Karma,"Waste of time. I do not accept this witness, nor his shoddy testimony."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,263,Judge,"Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Should he continue the testimony?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,264,Phoenix,Your Honor. Please... please allow the witness to continue his testimony.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,265,Karma,Bah! Nothing is more pitiful than a lawyer who doesn't know when he's lost!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,266,Judge,"Very well, Mr. Butz. Please give your testimony, and be sure to include details like your RADIO."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,267,Butz,Right! Leave it to me!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,268,Phoenix,"(I wouldn't if there were any other way out of this, believe me.)"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,269,Judge,You were listening to your radio... at a high volume!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,270,Butz,"Yeah, what's the big problem? Can't a man listen to his radio in peace? Isn't this a free country!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,271,Phoenix,(I truly believe Larry has no idea what the problem is.)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,272,Karma,Judge. Can you believe a word this witness says? What he heard was probably nothing more than a drum beat from the radio!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,273,Judge,"True enough, it is difficult to believe this testimony."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,274,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,275,Phoenix,"Wait, Your Honor! The witness said he remembers exactly what the DJ said when he heard the gunshot!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,276,Judge,"Excuse me? ""Dee-jay""...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,277,Phoenix,"An announcer... the guy who says things on the radio. Anyway! What this means is, when he heard the sound, no music was playing! The DJ only talks between songs! So he could have heard the gunshot from the lake! I'd like to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,278,Judge,"V-very well, Mr. Wright."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,279,Phoenix,(I can't believe I'm continuing this charade...)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,280,Butz,"It's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,281,Phoenix,"So, you turned on the radio?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,282,Butz,"Right! I just wanted to hear someone's voice, y'know? You don't know what it's like out there, alone, on Christmas Eve! Alone!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,283,Phoenix,(I shouldn't have said anything...)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,284,Butz,"That's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,285,Phoenix,Do you by any chance remember the name of the program you were listening to?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,286,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,287,Karma,"This has nothing to do with the case, Your Honor!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,288,Judge,"Objection sustained. The witness was listening to the radio. That is all we need to know. Tell us, Mr. Butz, how loud was your radio set to that night?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,289,Butz,"I was listening to it real booming loud, like."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,290,Phoenix,"Real ""booming"" loud?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,291,Butz,"Yeah, y'know."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,292,Judge,And you had headphones on?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,293,Butz,Yup.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,294,Judge,I wouldn't think you could hear anything going on outside at all...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,295,Butz,But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,296,Phoenix,"Can you prove that...? No... no, of course you can't."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,297,Butz,"Nah, I can't prove it. But I remember that moment real clear. I mean, while I was talking about it, it came back real clear to me, y'know?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,298,Butz,"I remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,299,Phoenix,What did he say?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,300,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,301,Karma,Mr. Wright! Please cease these pointless questions! What possible good could knowing what a radio DJ said do us!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,302,Judge,"Indeed, Mr. von Karma has a point. I'll allow the question only if you see some reason why we should care...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,303,Phoenix,"We should care, Your Honor! Of course we should!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,304,Karma,Why?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,305,Phoenix,"Uh. W-well, how do you know if we don't ask, hmm?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,306,Judge,"Fine, very well. Mr. Butz, please testify to the court. What was the radio announcer saying when you heard the gunshot?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,307,Butz,"Just when she said ""Hey! It's almost Christmas!"" I heard the gunshot!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,308,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,309,Phoenix,Are you sure?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,310,Butz,Course I am! She had this real sexy voice...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,311,Phoenix,(Hmm... maybe von Karma was right. I'm not sure how that helped us at all.)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,312,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,313,Phoenix,Larry! Are you absolutely sure what you're saying is correct!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,314,Butz,"Huh? What's with the face? You look scary, dude. Hey, if you're trying to scare me, you better know I don't scare that easy!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,315,Judge,"Is something the matter, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,316,Phoenix,"Your Honor! Did you hear what the witness just said? The DJ said ""Hey! It's almost Christmas!"" when he heard the gunshot!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,317,Judge,Indeed... And...?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,318,Phoenix,"""Almost Christmas"" means it wasn't Christmas! Do you realize what this means? When he heard the gunshot, it was still Christmas Eve!!!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,319,Judge,"That would seem to be the case, yes..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,320,Phoenix,"But that contradicts the two testimonies we have heard, Your Honor! Both Ms. Hart and the old man said it was after midnight when they heard the shots! In other words... When they heard the gunshots, it was already Christmas!!!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,321,Phoenix,(This is the most ludicrous testimony I've ever heard. But there is one gleaming ray of hope in there! I've got to press it until we get to the bottom of what happened!)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,322,Phoenix,"This is a clear contradiction, Your Honor!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,323,Judge,"Order! Order! What does this mean? The two prior witnesses heard gunshots after midnight. However, this witness says he heard a gunshot before midnight..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,324,Karma,Judge. The answer is simple. The current witness is plainly mistaken. Just look at him! Suspicious!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,325,Butz,Wh-whaaat!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,326,Judge,"Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think about Mr. Butz's claim that he heard the gunshot before midnight?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,327,Phoenix,"Larry's not mistaken, Your Honor! He heard that gunshot before midnight!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,328,Karma,... Intriguing. I'm assuming you have evidence for this wild claim? Show me evidence there was a gunshot before midnight!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,329,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,330,Phoenix,"Look at this photograph! This was taken by our witness yesterday, Ms. Lotta Hart, with her automatic camera. The timestamp on the photo reads ""December 24, 11:50 PM."""
Turnabout goodbyes,4,331,Judge,"Oh yeah? Hmm? But, there's nothing on the lake in this picture."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,332,Phoenix,Your Honor. The real issue here is not why nothing is shown in the photograph. It is why this photograph exists at all!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,333,Judge,What do you mean?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,334,Phoenix,Your Honor... This photograph was taken by an automatic camera. That camera was set to go off in response to loud noises!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,335,Judge,Ahah!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,336,Phoenix,"Correct! There was a loud noise on the lake at 11:50 PM. That is why this photograph was taken! In other words... When Larry heard that gunshot, it was most definitely Christmas Eve!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,337,Judge,"Indeed, it would seem that is the case! Then... where does that leave us? Ms. Hart testified that she heard the gunshots after midnight. Are you claiming she was mistaken?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,338,Phoenix,"Not at all, Your Honor. It is a fact that the camera also triggered at 15 minutes after midnight! Your Honor! That night, there were two sets of gunshots, with a 25 minute pause between them!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,339,Judge,Why would this be...?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,340,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,341,Karma,"Don't be fooled, Judge! That camera was set to respond to ""loud noises""!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,342,Judge,Yes?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,343,Karma,"There is no proof that the ""loud noise"" at 11:50 was a gunshot! Why, the witness could have sneezed, triggering the camera!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,344,Butz,"H-hey, my noise was clear that night, man! Clear!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,345,Judge,"Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? There's no turning back now. Can you prove that the ""loud noise"" at 11:50 PM was indeed a gunshot? Please show the court evidence if you have any."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,346,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,347,Phoenix,This is my evidence.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,348,Judge,The... murder weapon?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,349,Phoenix,"Something about this pistol was bothering me, Your Honor. Both of the witnesses who testified yesterday heard two gunshots. However, the murder weapon was fired three times. When, then, was the last shot fired? Only now have I realized the truth. That third shot was the shot Larry heard just before midnight!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,350,Judge,Order! Order! Hmm... That would make sense of the evidence we've seen so far. ... However... This leaves me wondering exactly what did happen that night on the lake.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,351,Karma,"Exactly! If this is true, there were two sets of gunshots, separated by 25 minutes! One at 11:50, another at 15 minutes after midnight! Why, I ask you! Why!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,352,Phoenix,"(Uh oh, I'd better think of something quick! ... Wait a second...! Gunshots separated by 25 minutes...?) Aaaaaaaaaaah!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,353,Maya,"Wh-what's wrong, Nick?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,354,Phoenix,I have it! I have it!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,355,Maya,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,356,Phoenix,Remember the case with the Steel Samurai!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,357,Maya,"Huh? Yeah, of course I remember..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,358,Phoenix,The murderer in this case had the same idea as the murderer in that case!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,359,Maya,What do you mean?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,360,Phoenix,Maya!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,361,Maya,Yes!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,362,Phoenix,"If we don't figure this out now, we'll never overturn Edgeworth's guilty verdict! I've got a hunch, and I'm going to run with it..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,363,Maya,Right! I mean... is this safe?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,364,Phoenix,Safe? We've already gotten a guilty verdict! We have nothing to lose!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,365,Maya,...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,366,Phoenix,"You just watch and let me know if I say anything that sounds fishy, okay?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,367,Maya,"Right, Nick!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,368,Phoenix,Your Honor!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,369,Judge,"Y-yes, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,370,Phoenix,The testimony just now has cleared up this entire case!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,371,Judge,"What do you mean, Mr. Wright!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,372,Karma,"Tsk tsk tsk... So, you've finally realized the truth? There can be no other murderer here than Miles Edgeworth himself."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,373,Phoenix,"Wrong, von Karma! A man was shot that night, but it wasn't Edgeworth who did the shooting!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,374,Karma,"Listen, rookie. Take a deep breath, and consider the facts. At the time of the murder, one boat was on the lake. This was shown by the witness's photograph. The defendant, Edgeworth, and victim, Robert Hammond, were on that boat. There was a gunshot fired on that boat, and Robert Hammond fell into the lake. The distance of the shooting was one meter. It couldn't have been suicide! Well? The guilty party has to be the other man on that boat!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,375,Judge,"I admit, it is hard to imagine any other possibility."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,376,Phoenix,Yes... But this assumes that the victim was shot at 15 minutes after midnight.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,377,Judge,"... What do you mean by that, Mr. Wright? We have photographic evidence of the time of the shooting. The timestamp on the photo says 00:15."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,378,Phoenix,But Larry heard a gunshot 25 minutes before that! Robert Hammond was killed then! 25 minutes before the shot on the lake! (That's the only way that Edgeworth could be innocent!)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,379,Judge,...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,380,Karma,... Mr. Wright. Are you quite mad? Explain who this is sitting on the boat!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,381,Phoenix,"Of course, it was Edgeworth and the murderer! After the murderer killed Robert Hammond at 11:50... He assumed the guise of Mr. Hammond and met Edgeworth!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,382,Judge,Wh... What!? Are you serious?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,383,Phoenix,"Yes. Edgeworth won't tell us why he went to the lake that night. However, I have a hunch. That night, Robert Hammond called Edgeworth to the lake. Now, Edgeworth didn't know Robert Hammond's face that well. That's why he didn't suspect anything when the murderer took Robert Hammond's place!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,384,Judge,... I'm not sure what to make of all this.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,385,Karma,L-Ludicrous!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,386,Judge,Mr. Wright. Tell us the name of the murderer then!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,387,Phoenix,The murderer's name...? Right! It's...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,388,Phoenix,"Actually, I don't know the murderer's name."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,389,Judge,Y-you don't know!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,390,Karma,"Bah! Again, you waste my time!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,391,Phoenix,I don't know because he never told us!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,392,Karma,...!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,393,Phoenix,"The murderer is the caretaker of the boat shop, that old man! At 11:50, he was the one who killed Robert Hammond."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,394,Judge,The caretaker of the boat shop!? Wh-where did he do this!? There weren't any boats on the lake then!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,395,Phoenix,Why would he have to go all the way out on the lake just to shoot someone? May I suggest... That the real scene of the crime was not in a boat!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,396,Judge,"What!? W-well then, where did the murder take place!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,397,Phoenix,(Show the judge where the murder really took place!)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,398,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,399,Phoenix,"Here, of course! The boat shop, where he lives. That way he could meet with the victim without anyone seeing!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,400,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,4,401,Karma,Do you have proof that the boat shop was the scene of the crime!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,402,Phoenix,"Recall Larry's testimony if you will. That night he was out on the lake in a boat, searching for something. He finds it, and returns the boat. Then, just as he's starting to head for home, he hears a gunshot! He heard a gunshot, Your Honor! Even though he was wearing headphones at the time! In other words, the gunshot was very, very close by! And where would that be if he had just returned a boat?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,403,Judge,"The boat shop...! Mr. Wright! What happened that night on Gourd Lake!? Please tell the court, from the beginning!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,404,Phoenix,"Y-yes, Your Honor."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,405,Maya,"Nick, are you sure about this...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,406,Phoenix,"Um, not really. But, I think if I start at the very beginning... And I take it slow, I must just be able to figure this out..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,407,Phoenix,"That night... The caretaker of the boat shop called Robert Hammond to his shop. This was around 11:50. That was when the gunshot that Larry heard was fired. After that, the caretaker put on Robert Hammond's coat... He became Robert Hammond! Then he got in the boat with Edgeworth, and went out into the middle of the lake."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,408,Judge,"Then... who fired the pistol on the boat, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,409,Phoenix,"Of course, it was the murderer who shot the pistol. He shot twice. Both missed Edgeworth, on purpose."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,410,Judge,Wait a minute...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,411,Phoenix,Y-yes?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,412,Judge,Why would he shoot twice if he didn't mean to hit anyone?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,413,Phoenix,Uh... (Details! Details!)
Turnabout goodbyes,4,414,Karma,"Know this, Mr. Wright. The moment you run out of explanations is the moment you lose. Tell us why the murderer had to fire twice!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,415,Phoenix,"I believe he shot twice to create a witness, Your Honor."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,416,Judge,Create a witness...?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,417,Phoenix,"The murderer lifts his pistol and fires one shot. That ensures that anyone who heard the shot would look at the lake. Indeed, Ms. Hart did exactly that after hearing the first gunshot. Next! The murderer waits a bit and he fires again. Then... The murderer jumps from the boat himself! Leaving the pistol in the boat behind him."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,418,Judge,... I see! To someone looking from the edge of the lake... It would appear that one of the men on the boat had shot the other!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,419,Phoenix,"The murderer didn't know about the automatic camera, of course. That's why he shot twice to draw attention to the boat!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,420,Judge,Hmm...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,421,Phoenix,"Once you realize that, everything else falls into place! The boat shop caretaker swam back to his shop. Then he put Mr. Hammond's coat back on the body. And threw the body into the lake! This is what happened, Your Honor. These are the events that transpired that night on Gourd Lake."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,422,Judge,...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,423,Karma,...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,424,Judge,... Bailiff! Bring out the witness from before! The boat shop caretaker! Quickly!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,425,Judge,"Very well. While we are waiting for the caretaker... I would like to ask the defendant, Miles Edgeworth, a few questions. Mr. Edgeworth. Please take the stand."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,426,Judge,Mr. Edgeworth... You heard what the defense has said?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,427,Edgeworth,Yes.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,428,Judge,Well? Why did you go to the lake that night?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,429,Edgeworth,"... What Wright has said was mostly correct. Astonishingly so, actually. Yes... Several days ago, I received a letter. The letter was signed, ""Robert Hammond."" He asked me to come to the boat shop by the lake at midnight on Christmas Eve. He said he had something very important to discuss with me."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,430,Judge,Something important?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,431,Edgeworth,... I'm sorry. I can't say what it was.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,432,Judge,Hmm...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,433,Guard,"Your Honor, sir!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,434,Judge,"Bailiff! We are conducting a trial here, I ask that you remain quiet..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,435,Guard,"The witness has disappeared! He isn't at the boat shop, either!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,436,Judge,What!?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,437,Guard,What should I do?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,438,Judge,"F-find him, quickly! We cannot allow him to get away!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,439,Judge,Mr. von Karma! Your witness has disappeared!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,440,Karma,... A search warrant has already been issued.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,441,Judge,"Hmm... It goes without saying that I cannot declare a verdict under these circumstances. I will extend the trial until tomorrow, the final day allowed. I request that the police department utilize all its forces to find that witness! Am I understood?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,442,Karma,...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,443,Judge,"One more thing. Just who is that boat shop caretaker? I think his identity has become very important to this trial. I want him, and I want to know who he is."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,444,Karma,...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,445,Judge,Very well. Court is adjourned!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,446,Maya,"Yay, Nick! You did it!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,447,Phoenix,"Yeah... Well, at least we got out from under that guilty verdict..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,448,Maya,And what about Larry! That was something else! Even von Karma didn't know what to do with his testimony! Larry really helped us out!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,449,Phoenix,"Sure, once I sifted through his ""unique"" testimony. Still... he did save us. I just wish our cases weren't so down to the wire all the time."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,450,Maya,I know what you mean. Sometimes I feel like it's us on trial instead of our clients!
Turnabout goodbyes,4,451,Phoenix,"Hey, Edgeworth..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,452,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,453,Maya,Umm... Mr. Edgeworth?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,454,Edgeworth,! D-did you say something?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,455,Maya,"Don't look so pained! I mean, it looks like you're probably going to get off the hook! You could try to smile just a little...? Relax!"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,456,Edgeworth,... I'm sorry... But... I fear it's not over for me yet.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,457,Phoenix,Wh-what do you mean?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,458,Edgeworth,Wright... There's something that's been troubling me for a long time now. And I don't know whether or not to tell you...
Turnabout goodbyes,4,459,Phoenix,Edgeworth?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,460,Edgeworth,"No... there's so little time left. I want to tell you, to get it off my chest, but... ... Hmm. I can't make up my mind. ..."
Turnabout goodbyes,4,461,Phoenix,"What is this about, Edgeworth?"
Turnabout goodbyes,4,462,Edgeworth,... It's... a nightmare I've had. A memory of a crime... that I committed.
Turnabout goodbyes,4,463,Phoenix,A crime you committed?
Turnabout goodbyes,4,464,Edgeworth,A memory... of a murder.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,0,Maya,What was Mr. Edgeworth talking about...?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,1,Edgeworth,A memory of a crime... that I committed. A memory... of a murder.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,2,Maya,Do you really think Mr. Edgeworth killed...?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,3,Phoenix,... I don't believe it. Not Edgeworth. Some painful memory has been troubling him recently... But he'd never take someone's life! Never!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,4,Maya,Nick...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,5,Butz,"Yo! How's everyone doing? Whaddya think of my performance today? I had 'em swooning in the aisles! Huh, Maya?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,6,Maya,"S-swooning? Me? Oh... Oh, yes. I do remember feeling faint."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,7,Butz,"Right on! Tell me the truth, it was like love at first sight, right? Right, Nick?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,8,Phoenix,"H-huh? Me!? I... uh, well, maybe my heart skipped a beat or two..."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,9,Butz,"... I think you can do better than that! C'mon! I saved Edgeworth in there, dude! Edgey! You guys should be bowing before me! Yeah! Bow before your hero!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,10,Phoenix,Larry... You really helped out in the trial today.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,11,Maya,"You did! If you weren't there, Larry, I'm sure Mr. Edgeworth would have been found guilty!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,12,Butz,"Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah! But, seriously, Nick. That boat shop caretaker guy is pretty suspicious... But Edgey ain't off the hook yet!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,13,Maya,"Way to spoil the mood, Larry."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,14,Butz,"Hey, I'm just a guy sitting in the audience, you know? But from where I was sitting, Edgey seemed pretty... edgy. I mean, can you really know he's telling the truth about that night?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,15,Phoenix,...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,16,Maya,Nick?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,17,Phoenix,I don't know. But... what I do know is... I'm going to believe in you two until the end.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,18,Butz,Us two?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,19,Maya,Edgeworth and... who else? You mean me right?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,20,Butz,"Nah! He means me! Right, Nick?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,21,Phoenix,"Yeah, you, Larry."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,22,Maya,"Not... me? ... B-but why you, Larry!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,23,Butz,"Huh? Um, actually, yeah. Why me, Nick?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,24,Phoenix,...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,25,Maya,Hmph. Enough with the silent treatment!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,26,Maya,"Nick... Why do you trust Mr. Edgeworth so much? I mean, he's changed recently, true. But when we first met him, he was kind of jerk, don't ya think?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,27,Phoenix,... You didn't know him back then. Back when he wanted to become a defense attorney.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,28,Maya,Wait... Was that when you two were classmates?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,29,Phoenix,"Yes. In grade school... They saved me... Miles... And Larry. They saved me and I'll never forget it. That's why I became a defense attorney, you know."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,30,Maya,"Whaaaat!? Hey, hey, Larry. What's he talking about?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,31,Butz,"Huh? Uh... umm... Er, sorry. I kinda forgot."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,32,Maya,"Hmph. Okay, Nick. Out with it! I'm going to hear this story today, and that's final!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,33,Phoenix,"Okay, okay. It's kind of a long story, so hang in there. ... It was the beginning of Spring, 4th grade. I was on trial. A class trial."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,34,Maya,A c-class trial!?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,35,Phoenix,"You remember, Larry? Spring, 4th grade? A kid in my class got his lunch money stolen."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,36,Maya,Lunch money?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,37,Phoenix,"Our school was really small. Every month, kids would bring in an envelope with money for lunch from home."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,38,Maya,"Huh, I see."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,39,Phoenix,"Anyway, this kid's envelope disappeared. With $38.00 still inside."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,40,Butz,"Oh... Yeah, now that you mention it, I do remember that!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,41,Phoenix,"I can see why you'd forget, though. You were out of school that day. Anyway, the envelope had been stolen during PE class. I was coming down with a cold, so I'd skipped PE that day. I was the only one not in class."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,42,Maya,So... they thought you did it?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,43,Phoenix,Yeah. The kids in class said I should be put on trial.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,44,Maya,Trial...?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,45,Phoenix,"So the next day we held a classroom trial, with me as the defendant."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,46,Phoenix,"""I... I didn't do it!"""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,47,Teacher,"""Now, Phoenix, you know you shouldn't steal people's money! It's not right."""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,48,Phoenix,"In the end, even the teacher thought I'd done it."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,49,Teacher,"""Apologize to the class, Phoenix."""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,50,Phoenix,I... I didn't know what was happening. I was so sad... I couldn't stop crying. Everyone was staring at me like I'd done it... I tried to apologize. I went over to where the boy was sitting... ... That's when it happened.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,51,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,5,52,Edgeworth,"""He shouldn't have to apologize! The only thing that belongs in a trial is evidence! Anything else has no place! You should all be ashamed... amateurs!"""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,53,Teacher,"""M-Miles?"""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,54,Edgeworth,"""It wasn't you who stole my money, was it?"""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,55,Phoenix,"""No..."""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,56,Edgeworth,"""Then you shouldn't apologize! Everyone's been shouting you did it, but no one has any proof! That is why, Your Honor, this boy is innocent!"""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,57,Teacher,"""B-but Miles, it was your money that was stolen!"""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,58,Butz,"""Why don't you all just shut up!!!"""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,59,Butz,"""This is always how it is, everybody ganging up and picking on one person. Just think how he feels! He said he didn't do it, so he didn't do it!"""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,60,Teacher,"""Very well. I will replace the money myself. This class trial is over."""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,61,Phoenix,"That's how it happened. After that, the three of us were always friends."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,62,Maya,Wow... I had no idea!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,63,Butz,"Yeah... I had no idea, either! I mean, I forgot."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,64,Phoenix,"That's what I learned what it meant to be alone. Totally alone, without a friend in the world."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,65,Maya,"You did a good thing, Larry!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,66,Butz,"Um, yeah, well... I was just lucky that I took the day off from school. If I'd been there they would have thought I'd done it! So, I took it kind of personally, see."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,67,Phoenix,"(""When something smells, it's usually the Butz."")"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,68,Phoenix,"Anyway, Edgeworth and I talked after that class trial. That's when I heard his father was a defense attorney. I remember, his eyes would shine when he talked about his father."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,69,Edgeworth,"""I'm going to become a defense attorney, just like my Dad! A famous defense attorney!"""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,70,Phoenix,"Then, a few months later, he suddenly transferred to another school."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,71,Maya,The DL-6 Incident...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,72,Phoenix,"Right. I'm not sure, but the transfer probably had to do with his father's death."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,73,Maya,That's so sad!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,74,Phoenix,"... It was several years later when I heard Edgeworth's name again. There was an article about him in the newspaper. The headline was something like ""Dark Suspicions of a Demon Attorney."" Fabricating evidence, manipulating testimonies, covering up facts... The article said he'd do anything to get a guilty verdict. Anything."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,75,Butz,"But why? What happened!? I mean, that's not the Edgey I used to know at all!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,76,Phoenix,That's what I thought too. I tried to get in touch with him I don't know how many times... He never replied.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,77,Maya,I guess he didn't want to see his old friends...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,78,Phoenix,"I couldn't just drop it, though. I wanted to meet him, to know why he had become who he became. That's when I decided."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,79,Maya,...! Wait... You don't mean...? That's why!? That's why you became a defense attorney!? To meet Edgeworth!?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,80,Phoenix,"If I was a defense attorney, I knew he's have to meet me whether he wanted to or not. In court. ... Edgeworth believed in me, and I believe in him. He's in pain... And no one's on his side. I'm the only one who knows the real Edgeworth. I'm the only one who can help him."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,81,Butz,"Whoa... Nick. S-so, is that why you helped me out for free?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,82,Phoenix,Uh... yes. I helped you because I believed in you. (Except I don't remember saying I'd do it for free...)
Turnabout goodbyes,5,83,Butz,"Aw, Nick! Nick!!!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,84,Maya,"Nick! We have to save Mr. Edgeworth if it's the last thing we do, okay?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,85,Phoenix,Right. (It very well may be...)
Turnabout goodbyes,5,86,Maya,"First, there's that rental boat shop caretaker. We need to find out who or what he is!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,87,Phoenix,"I'd settle for who. (I guess I can clean out some of this evidence I no longer need... ...) Okay, let's go!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,88,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,89,Phoenix,You look grim as always.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,90,Edgeworth,Hmph.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,91,Maya,"Um, Mr. Edgeworth? I heard the story about the class trial..."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,92,Edgeworth,Class trial? What do you mean?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,93,Maya,You... don't remember?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,94,Edgeworth,"No, I don't."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,95,Maya,"Your lunch money was stolen, wasn't it? In 4th grade...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,96,Edgeworth,"Lunch money...? ... Oh... Oh, right. Yes, I seem to remember something like that."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,97,Maya,Nick. I think you're the only one who really remembers.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,98,Phoenix,"Well, it probably only really mattered to me anyway."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,99,Maya,"Mr. Edgeworth, didn't you know? That trial was the reason Nick became a defense attorney!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,100,Edgeworth,... Ridiculous!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,101,Phoenix,(Gee... thanks.)
Turnabout goodbyes,5,102,Edgeworth,"That said... It does sound like that kind of thing you'd do. You haven't changed a bit, have you, Wright? So...simple. To a fault, even."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,103,Phoenix,"Well, maybe yeah, but... I think you changed too much, Edgeworth."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,104,Edgeworth,... Perhaps.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,105,Phoenix,"Hey, Edgeworth. Why did you become a prosecutor, anyway? You used to look up to your dad... You said you wanted to be a defense attorney, right?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,106,Edgeworth,... I couldn't let myself deny reality like you.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,107,Phoenix,What do you mean?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,108,Edgeworth,"My father was taken from me, and you want me to defend criminals? I'm sorry, Wright, but I'm not that good of a person!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,109,Maya,"One suspect was apprehended in your father's murder, right?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,110,Edgeworth,"Yes. The man trapped in the elevator with my father. His name... was Yanni Yogi. He had to be the shooter, any way you look at it! Yet... he was found innocent. That defense attorney got him off the hook!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,111,Phoenix,(That would be Robert Hammond...)
Turnabout goodbyes,5,112,Edgeworth,"On that day, 15 years ago... The three of us were trapped in that elevator for five hours. When we were rescued, we all suffered oxygen deprivation. I had lost all memory of the murder."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,113,Phoenix,Lost your memory?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,114,Edgeworth,"Even now, I can't recall what happened in that elevator. That was the crux of Yogi's argument in court. He claimed Yanni Yogi had been ""not of sound mind"" due to the oxygen deprivation. Yogi was released due to a lack of evidence... innocent. That's when I changed my mind. I started to hate defense attorneys."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,115,Phoenix,What's your relationship with von Karma?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,116,Edgeworth,"He's my teacher, and a man who deserves respect. I learned everything I know of courtroom techniques from him."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,117,Maya,"So, he's like my sister was to you, Nick."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,118,Edgeworth,He is a perfectionist in all things. In court... In his personal life... He is obsessed with doing everything perfectly.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,119,Maya,"Perfectly, huh?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,120,Edgeworth,"In all the cases he has taken on, none were left unsolved. And not one suspect was declared innocent. Ever."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,121,Maya,But... but that's...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,122,Edgeworth,"I know. It's possible some of the suspects were indeed innocent. However, it is impossible for us to accurately determine that in every case. All von Karma does is his job, to find the suspect guilty, perfectly. In any case... It's nigh well impossible to find a weakness in him. Should a weakness appear, he would do everything in his power to make it go away."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,123,Phoenix,"Um, Edgeworth? If what you're saying is true, you're headed for a guilty sentence tomorrow!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,124,Maya,"H-he's right! Now's no time to be praising the enemy, Mr. Edgeworth!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,125,Edgeworth,"Mmph... It's a strange situation in which I find myself, I'll admit."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,126,Phoenix,(No kidding.)
Turnabout goodbyes,5,127,Gumshoe,"Hey, pal! Long time no see!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,128,Maya,Oh! Detective Gumshoe!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,129,Gumshoe,"Close one today, eh! I got so worked up, I snapped my tie in half!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,130,Phoenix,Uh... Sorry about that.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,131,Gumshoe,"No prob, pal! Thanks to you, we now know who really did it!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,132,Maya,"You mean, the boat shop caretaker?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,133,Gumshoe,"Look, I'll make you a promise. I'll have that scoundrel in my custody by trial time tomorrow! Come what may! It's my duty to you as a police officer! Now, I'm off to catch me a criminal!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,134,Maya,... Detective Gumshoe sure is... active today.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,135,Gumshoe,"Oh, one other thing!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,136,Maya,Eek!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,137,Gumshoe,No one can go into the woods today.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,138,Maya,The woods?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,139,Phoenix,(Where Lotta was camping?)
Turnabout goodbyes,5,140,Gumshoe,"The woods are off-limits to camping, and apparently the park ranger found out. He got pretty mad. No one can go in for a while."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,141,Maya,I guess Lotta's in a 'lotta' trouble...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,142,Gumshoe,"Anyway, I'll be seeing you tomorrow!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,143,Maya,That old caretaker got away...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,144,Phoenix,Yep.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,145,Maya,I never imagined he might be the real murderer! ...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,146,Grossberg,*Ah-HHHHEM!*
Turnabout goodbyes,5,147,Phoenix,...! (I'd know that clearing-of-the-throat anywhere!)
Turnabout goodbyes,5,148,Grossberg,"Ah hah, hello! What might you be doing here? Out for a walk, hmm? ""Ahh... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon..."" you see."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,149,Maya,Mr. Grossberg! This is no time for idle reminiscing! Mr. Edgeworth's trial ends tomorrow!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,150,Grossberg,"Er... that is true, yes. But, from what I saw of today's trial, Edgeworth should be fine, right?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,151,Phoenix,Well... I'm not so sure about that.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,152,Grossberg,Ho ho! What do you mean by that?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,153,Phoenix,Well... I'm not sure.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,154,Grossberg,"Hmm... If you find anything out, come by my office at once. I may be able to offer you some assistance."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,155,Phoenix,Thanks... (Bye...)
Turnabout goodbyes,5,156,Maya,What do you think Mr. Grossberg was doing here anyway?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,157,Phoenix,Who knows...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,158,Phoenix,...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,159,Maya,Nobody's home.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,160,Parrot,"""Hello! Hello!"" *squawk*"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,161,Maya,"Hey! It's Polly! I wonder where your owner's gone, Polly?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,162,Parrot,"""Hello! Hello!"" *squawk*"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,163,Maya,I can't believe he'd run off and leave his poor parrot to fend for herself!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,164,Parrot,"""Hello! Hello!"" *squawk*"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,165,Maya,"That reminds me, Nick! Polly here knows the number to this safe, right?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,166,Phoenix,"Yeah, that's right."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,167,Maya,"Polly, what's the number to the safe?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,168,Parrot,"""1228""! *squawk*"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,169,Maya,"Let's open it, Nick! C'mon!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,170,Phoenix,I'm sure there isn't any money in there.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,171,Maya,"Aww... But, hey! He keeps it locked, right? So there must be something of value in there!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,172,Phoenix,I'm not so sure...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,173,Maya,"Okay, Nick, let's see what's in there!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,174,Phoenix,(I guess there might be a clue or two...) ... The only thing in here is a letter.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,175,Maya,A letter? Aww... boring!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,176,Phoenix,"(Hmm... There's no name or signature on this thing. It's handwritten in very precise, clear letters...) ... ""Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth..."" Edgeworth!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,177,Maya,N-N-Nick! Why would Mr. Edgeworth's name be on here...?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,178,Phoenix,How should I know!? I'm going to read the whole thing...!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,179,Phoenix,"(The rest of the letter goes on to describe the murder plot in detail! How to kill Robert Hammond, and frame Edgeworth... ...Calling Edgeworth out to the lake, getting on the boat... firing twice! This is exactly what I figured out today in court! It's all here... in perfect detail!) ..."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,180,Maya,"What do you think it means, Nick?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,181,Phoenix,"I don't know... but it looks like these are instructions for that caretaker. When he killed Robert Hammond and called out Edgeworth, he was following instructions!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,182,Maya,"But who could have written that letter? And... what does it mean, to ""get revenge on Miles Edgeworth""...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,183,Phoenix,"Look, I don't know, okay? But one thing's for certain. This letter is an amazing clue!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,184,Phoenix,Edgeworth... See this letter?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,185,Edgeworth,Hmm?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,186,Phoenix,This came out of the safe in the shack where that boat rental caretaker lives.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,187,Edgeworth,I see... ...! Revenge... on me?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,188,Maya,"Who is that old guy, anyway!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,189,Edgeworth,I... I don't know.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,190,Phoenix,Could he be an innocent defendant you got declared guilty or something?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,191,Edgeworth,"Nice, Wright. But I don't remember that old man. Not at all."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,192,Maya,"So, he was following this letter, then?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,193,Edgeworth,Which means there was someone else behind it!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,194,Edgeworth,Two men... meaning myself and Robert Hammond?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,195,Maya,"It also says: ""This is your last chance!"""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,196,Phoenix,"Last chance...? Wait, maybe... Maybe he's talking about the statute of limitations on the DL-6 Incident!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,197,Edgeworth,"... Wait... Wait, that old man...!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,198,Maya,Wh-what is it!? Do you know who he is!?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,199,Edgeworth,Yogi... Could he be Yogi!?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,200,Maya,Yogi?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,201,Edgeworth,The suspect in the DL-6 Incident. The one who was found innocent.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,202,Edgeworth,"Yanni Yogi was a court bailiff at the time. We just happened to be in that elevator together 15 years ago. The quake was incredibly strong... Before I knew it, everything was dark. We were there for so long, it felt like forever. The air thinned... and the darkness closed in on us in that little box. We became... unsettled."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,203,Edgeworth,"That's all I remember... When I came to, I was in a hospital bed, staring up at the ceiling.In court, Yanni Yogi's mental condition was called into question. They claimed the oxygen deprivation and stress had caused temporary insanity. In the end, the claim passed the court, and Yogi was found innocent."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,204,Maya,"Huh... But, isn't that strange? This letter tells him to ""get revenge on Edgeworth""... Why would he want to take revenge on you?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,205,Edgeworth,... Wright.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,206,Phoenix,Yeah?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,207,Edgeworth,There's something that's been troubling me these last few days. I... didn't know whether or not I should tell you.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,208,Phoenix,You mean the nightmare?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,209,Edgeworth,It's... a nightmare I've had. A memory of a crime... that I committed.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,210,Phoenix,A crime you committed?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,211,Edgeworth,...A memory... of a murder.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,212,Edgeworth,I think... I think the time has come to tell all.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,213,Edgeworth,"For the last 15 years, I've had the same dream almost every night. I wake up in a fearful sweat, every time."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,214,Maya,What kind of dream?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,215,Edgeworth,It's a dream about my father's killing... in the dark.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,216,Edgeworth,"Then I see the pistol lying by my feet. I don't know if it was evidence from that day in court, or the bailiff's... In a daze, I pick up the pistol..."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,217,Edgeworth,(Get away...! Get away from my father!)
Turnabout goodbyes,5,218,Edgeworth,And with that scream... I wake. It's a bone-chilling scream. A scream that has rung in my ears for the past 15 years.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,219,Maya,"... B-but... That's just a dream, right? Right?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,220,Edgeworth,... That thought is the only thing that has kept me sane for the last 15 years. But what if I'm wrong? What if it's real? They say that sometimes people shut out memories in self-defense. Maybe it was I who killed my father!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,221,Maya,What!?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,222,Edgeworth,"If you think about it that way, this letter makes sense. ""Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth."" Think about it. Yogi was really innocent. That's why he wanted revenge against me!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,223,Phoenix,"Wait, Edgeworth! You... you mean...!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,224,Edgeworth,It was me. I was the true criminal of DL-6. I shot my father!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,225,Phoenix,This is bad...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,226,Maya,"What are we doing to do, Nick? What can we do!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,227,Phoenix,"I don't know... I don't think there is anything we can do. Like it or not. If there's someone else who knows a lot about the DL-6 Incident, maybe..."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,228,Maya,"...! There is, Nick! There is someone else who knows about DL-6!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,229,Phoenix,M-Mr. Grossberg!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,230,Grossberg,"Ah, hello there. What's wrong? You look troubled."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,231,Maya,No kidding! I can't believe you're not!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,232,Grossberg,"M-my my my... Just calm down and tell me what's happened, hmm?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,233,Maya,It's M-Mr. Edgeworth! He... He... *sob*
Turnabout goodbyes,5,234,Grossberg,"I see... So, Edgeworth dreamt he shot his own father?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,235,Maya,It's o-only a dream! Only a dream!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,236,Grossberg,... I wonder...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,237,Maya,W-what...?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,238,Grossberg,"If that's the case, then why do you two look so troubled, hmm?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,239,Maya,W-well...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,240,Grossberg,"Also, consider this. Yogi quite certainly holds a deep grudge against Miles Edgeworth. So deep, he'd want to frame him for murder. This leads me to surmise... That Mr. Edgeworth's dream was NOT a dream. It was real. As you imagined. Miles Edgeworth threw the pistol to save his father... the pistol fired... and the deed was done. ..."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,241,Maya,N... No! I don't believe it!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,242,Grossberg,"Yogi was suspected of murder, and his career as bailiff was irrevocably wrecked. Thus, he sought revenge on Miles Edgeworth. This was his last chance, of course, with the statute of limitations so close."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,243,Phoenix,What do you know about Edgeworth's father?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,244,Grossberg,"... He was a defense attorney without peer. It sounds trite, but it's true. Well, he may have had one peer now that I think about it. Your mentor, Mia Fey."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,245,Maya,My sister...?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,246,Grossberg,Gregory Edgeworth was very disapproving of Mr. von Karma's techniques.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,247,Phoenix,(That's no surprise...)
Turnabout goodbyes,5,248,Grossberg,"von Karma is an extreme man. Forged testimonies and evidence are nothing to him. The result: he has a perfect win record in court. To beat him, Gregory Edgeworth tried to call attention to his methods."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,249,Maya,And...?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,250,Grossberg,"He lost. And died in despair, as it were."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,251,Maya,I see...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,252,Grossberg,"When Gregory Edgeworth was killed, the police called on a spirit medium. That was your mother, Misty Fey."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,253,Gregory,"""I am Gregory Edgeworth... I have been killed... The one who shot me... was the bailiff... Yanni Yogi."""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,254,Grossberg,Yet Yogi was found innocent.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,255,Maya,That's when my mother left us. Everyone called her a fraud.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,256,Grossberg,"That's right. Everyone thought she was, you see. Yet... now that I think about it. It seem the one who lied was Gregory Edgeworth's ghost... Gregory Edgeworth must have known who shot him."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,257,Phoenix,"I don't believe it... So you're saying he falsified his ""testimony""? That Edgeworth's dad lied to protect his son...?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,258,Grossberg,"It's only a possibility, mind you. But... a possibility nonetheless."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,259,Grossberg,So this is the letter? It does seem that Yogi was following this letter... when he killed Hammond.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,260,Maya,"But, why kill Robert Hammond?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,261,Grossberg,"Hammond was a skilled defense attorney. But... he defended clients not for their sake, but for his own."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,262,Phoenix,Huh? His own sake?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,263,Grossberg,"He never trusted his clients, that one. The only thing he trusted was his own ability."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,264,Maya,"But, he got his client found innocent. So why should it matter?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,265,Grossberg,"Actually, my dear, it's quite different. He won that innocent verdict for no one but himself. Yogi was a free man, but socially, he was ruined."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,266,Phoenix,(Huh...?)
Turnabout goodbyes,5,267,Grossberg,You'll understand soon enough. ... Wait!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,268,Phoenix,What is it?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,269,Grossberg,This letter... I've seen this handwriting somewhere before... a long time ago! Whose handwriting was this...? Do you have any idea who wrote this?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,270,Grossberg,"If it truly was von Karma who wrote this letter, then he would know the truth. He would know that Miles Edgeworth had accidentally killed his own father."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,271,Phoenix,...!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,272,Grossberg,"He'll say as much tomorrow in court, I should think. He'll press the point until the court finds Miles Edgeworth ""guilty."""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,273,Phoenix,Oh no!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,274,Maya,B-but how could von Karma know about Mr. Edgeworth's past like that? Even Mr. Edgeworth thought it was just a nightmare!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,275,Grossberg,"Hmm... That, I do not know. Yet I do know that von Karma is both persistent... and a perfectionist. He may be seeking to satisfy a grudge against Gregory Edgeworth by hurting his son."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,276,Phoenix,What do you mean?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,277,Grossberg,"It was fifteen years ago... von Karma met Gregory Edgeworth in court, and von Karma did win... But he didn't make it through the trial unscarred."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,278,Phoenix,What happened in the trial between Edgeworth's dad and von Karma?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,279,Grossberg,"von Karma got the ""guilty"" verdict he wanted. He won the trial. But Gregory Edgeworth accused von Karma of faulty evidence. And though he lost the trial, Mr. Edgeworth's accusation stood."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,280,Maya,Faulty evidence?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,281,Grossberg,It was the only penalty von Karma has ever received in his career as a prosecutor. Gregory Edgeworth dealt a blow to his perfect trial record.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,282,Maya,Wow.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,283,Grossberg,"It must have been quite a shock for von Karma. He took a vacation for several months after that, you see."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,284,Phoenix,A vacation...?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,285,Grossberg,"Yes, an unusual event for the man. That was the first, and the last vacation he's taken in his many years of prosecuting."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,286,Maya,"Really!? He doesn't take vacations!? Like... go to the sea, or, uh, to the mountains? Don't tell me he's never been to Europe!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,287,Phoenix,"You have strange ideas about vacations, Maya."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,288,Grossberg,In any case... That was the only time he took a vacation from work. I believe the penalty upset him quite a lot.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,289,Phoenix,(Odd... If he wanted to keep a perfect record so badly... why would he take such a long vacation?)
Turnabout goodbyes,5,290,Maya,"What do we do, Nick? von Karma is going to bring up DL-6, you can bet on it! What if Mr. Edgeworth pleads guilty to DL-6!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,291,Phoenix,I won't let him!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,292,Grossberg,"Erm, yes, Mr. Wright... I hate to say this... But even accidental murder is murder, you know."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,293,Phoenix,I know that! ... I... I just believe in Edgeworth's innocence! I can't believe he'd kill someone!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,294,Maya,"B-but, Nick! Mr. Edgeworth admits it himself! His father must have lied to protect him, beyond the grave..."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,295,Phoenix,I don't care! I know he's not guilty!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,296,Grossberg,"... Mr. Wright... If you say so, I suppose I could go check again. The police files might hold something of interest."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,297,Phoenix,Mr. Grossberg... thank you!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,298,Grossberg,"I can't promise anything. In fact, I think the chances of finding something are slim."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,299,Phoenix,I understand. (The police materials... hmm.)
Turnabout goodbyes,5,300,Maya,There's hardly anyone here...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,301,Phoenix,Everyone must be out looking for the old guy... Yogi.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,302,Police,"Ah, it's you. I don't think Gumshoe'll be coming back today. He's staying out late looking for someone."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,303,Maya,"Sounds like Detective Gumshoe is pounding the pavement for real! Um, we were wondering if we could check out the Records Room again..."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,304,Police,"Well, now, I can't have just anyone wandering around in there. But... I guess Mr. von Karma is in there now, anyway. You can go in as long as he's there."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,305,Maya,von Karma...?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,306,Police,Yes. He just arrived actually.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,307,Phoenix,(von Karma's in the Records Room!)
Turnabout goodbyes,5,308,Maya,N-Nick! Let's hurry!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,309,Maya,Dusty as always!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,310,Phoenix,We were only here just yesterday. I'm sure they just haven't had time to clean... ...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,311,Maya,"What's wrong, Nick?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,312,Phoenix,Nothing. I was just noticing that he isn't here. von Karma...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,313,Maya,Huh? One of the drawers here is open.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,314,Phoenix,Someone must have been looking in it recently.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,315,Maya,"The label says, ""Unsolved Cases: Evidence"""
Turnabout goodbyes,5,316,Phoenix,"Hmm... ""Unsolved cases""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,317,Maya,Nick! The file for DL-6... it's completely empty!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,318,Phoenix,Wh-what!?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,319,Karma,What are you doing in here!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,320,Maya,Eeek! v-v-von Karma!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,321,Karma,You...! ... How do you know my name?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,322,Maya,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,323,Karma,Have we met?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,324,Maya,"W-w-what are you saying!? We see each other every day, don't we? We're Miles Edgeworth's defense team!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,325,Karma,"Defense team...? Ahem. I beg your pardon, you see, I rarely remember defense attorneys. They are like bugs to me. Needless things, to be crushed."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,326,Phoenix,(I can see how this guy was Edgeworth's mentor.)
Turnabout goodbyes,5,327,Phoenix,"Mr. von Karma, have a look at this."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,328,Karma,...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,329,Phoenix,"This was you, wasn't it? You instructed Yanni Yogi to commit murder."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,330,Karma,... Yanni Yogi... How many years has it been since I've heard him called by that name. He's a fool. I told him to burn it after he read it.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,331,Maya,...! S-so you admit it! You... you wrote Mr. Yogi this letter!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,332,Karma,"Yes, my dear defense attorney. Thank you for taking the trouble to bring it to me. You've saved me from a lot of needless hassle."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,333,Phoenix,Wh-what!?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,334,Maya,N-Nick! What is that thing!?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,335,Phoenix,A stun gun. For self defense... usually.
Turnabout goodbyes,5,336,Karma,"Indeed. 600,000 volts will course through your body like a dog touching an electric fence."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,337,Phoenix,Six hundred thous...!?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,338,Karma,"Oh, don't worry. People don't die from it, usually. Now, give me the letter."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,339,Phoenix,(No!!!)
Turnabout goodbyes,5,340,Maya,Nooooooooooo!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,341,Karma,Whoa! What are you--!?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,342,Maya,N-Nick! Run!!! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,343,Phoenix,M-Maya!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,344,Karma,Out of my way!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,345,Phoenix,Waaaaaaaaaaaah!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,346,Phoenix,"(Ugh... he got us. The letter's... gone, of course. And he took the DL-6 evidence... all of it. Back to having no clues. Wait... Maya jumped first. Maya...! Is she okay? ...) Ma...Maya!"
Turnabout goodbyes,5,347,Maya,...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,348,Phoenix,Maya! Open your eyes!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,349,Maya,...
Turnabout goodbyes,5,350,Phoenix,Maya!
Turnabout goodbyes,5,351,Maya,... The letter! Did he take it?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,352,Phoenix,Huh!? Oh... yeah. A-are you okay!?
Turnabout goodbyes,5,353,Maya,"... I... I couldn't stop him. I jumped as fast as I could, but one shot from that thing knocked me out cold. I'm useless. I'm not good as a lawyer, or a medium! I can't even call my sister. Not even now, when we need her the most. I wish I hadn't woken up at all."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,354,Phoenix,"Maya! (Grr! There has to be some way I can help her! I'd better do something about her self-confidence, first.) ...? (Maya... She's holding something! What is that? A bullet?) ""DL-6 Incident, Evidence No. 7 Taken from the heart of Gregory Edgeworth."" I remember... von Karma was holding this when Maya jumped him."
Turnabout goodbyes,5,355,Phoenix,"(I'll prove it to you, Maya. You're most definitely not useless! I'll prove it to you in court tomorrow!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,0,Phoenix,"(This is it... judgment day. Today, things are gong to get settled at last... a lot of things.) Waaaaaaaargh! Wh-what's the big idea!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,1,Maya,"S-s-sorry, Nick! I only touched your shoulder! I guess the ""shock"" hasn't worn off from my run-in with the stun gun yesterday. Anyhow, today's the last day of the trial! Good luck, Nick!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,2,Phoenix,"Yeah... thanks, Maya."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,3,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,4,Phoenix,(Edgeworth is looking glum as always. I hope von Karma doesn't push him too hard.)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,5,Edgeworth,... Whooooooooaa! Wh-wh-what are you doing!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,6,Maya,Sorry! I'm sorry! I just thought I'd ch-cheer you up with a pat on the back...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,7,Phoenix,Maya... Maybe you should go outside and discharge?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,8,Maya,Right. Good idea.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,9,Phoenix,(Try not to electrocute anyone on your way out...)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,10,Gumshoe,What's gotten into that girl?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,11,Phoenix,Detective Gumshoe!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,12,Gumshoe,Morning! Mr. Edgeworth?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,13,Edgeworth,Uh... good morning.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,14,Phoenix,"How did it go, Detective?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,15,Gumshoe,"Have no fear! As promised, I've captured our runaway caretaker! I just brought him in. Took all night, pal."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,16,Phoenix,"Thanks, Detective Gumshoe. You must be tired."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,17,Gumshoe,"Actually, after that shock I got on the way in, I feel pretty good."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,18,Phoenix,(Yogi says he's forgotten his own name... But that has to be a lie! Why would he want revenge on Edgeworth if he couldn't remember his past!? He does remember... and I'm going to prove it!)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,19,Judge,Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,20,Phoenix,"The defense is ready, Your Honor."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,21,Karma,... The prosecution... is ready.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,22,Judge,"... U-uh... right, very well. We have reached the final day of our proceedings in this trial. I ask that the prosecution submit decisive evidence."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,23,Karma,Understood.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,24,Judge,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,25,Phoenix,(C'mon! Don't be awed into silence by every little thing he says!)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,26,Judge,"Very well, Mr. von Karma, your opening statement."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,27,Karma,"Right. Thanks to Detective Gumshoe's efforts, the boat rental shop caretaker has been arrested. In yesterday's trial, the defense asserted that the caretaker was the murderer. However, the caretaker has yet to confirm this. I would like to ask the defense to cross-examine him as much as necessary."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,28,Judge,Very well! Please bring the witness into the courtroom.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,29,Karma,"Ladies and gentlemen of the court... I believe you all remember our witness. He lives in the boat rental shop on the lake, from where he witnessed the incident. In addition, he has currently lost memory of his name and identity."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,30,Judge,Witness! Why did you run away yesterday?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,31,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,32,Karma,"The witness was not running away, as he will now testify."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,33,Judge,"I-I see. Very well, please begin your testimony."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,34,Uncle,Zzz... mmph?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,35,Uncle,"Er, I'm really sorry about just leaving yesterday like I did."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,36,Phoenix,"I'd call what you did ""running away,"" and not ""just leaving."" You heard Larry's testimony, and realized you were in danger!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,37,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,38,Karma,"Now, Mr. Wright, there's no need to rush to conclusions. As I said, the witness was not ""running away."" Listen to the testimony."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,39,Phoenix,"(He sure seems relaxed! In fact, they both do--von Karma and Yanni Yogi!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,40,Uncle,"But, I wasn't running away or nothing."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,41,Phoenix,Then why did you leave!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,42,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,43,Karma,He's just about to say why! Is it so hard for you just quietly listen when someone is talking!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,44,Phoenix,"(If I sat quietly, Edgeworth would be guilty in three minutes!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,45,Uncle,"I, uh, went to buy some food for Polly, see..."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,46,Phoenix,Food...?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,47,Uncle,"Well, Polly is a bit of a gourmand, you see. She only eats these high-quality bird pellets from France. They only have them in the big pet shop downtown."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,48,Phoenix,But you weren't arrested until this morning! Why didn't you go back to the caretaker's shack?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,49,Uncle,"Er... well... I kind of got lost, you see."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,50,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,51,Karma,"The witness has trouble remembering things sometimes. When the police apprehended him, he was on his way back to the shack!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,52,Phoenix,"(Yeah, right! Nice try von Karma! No one's going to believe that!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,53,Judge,Hmm... I see! So he was lost!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,54,Phoenix,"(Please! Your Honor, come to your senses!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,55,Uncle,I figured I got nothing to do with this incident anyhow.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,56,Phoenix,"You've lost much of your memory, is that correct?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,57,Uncle,"Er... ayup, seems like it."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,58,Phoenix,Then how could you know that you didn't have anything to do with this incident!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,59,Uncle,Uh...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,60,Phoenix,"Or... Or maybe you're lying about not having your memory, hmm? You know exactly who you are!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,61,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,62,Karma,"The witness has testified quite clearly that he has no memory of who he is. If you claim he's lying, then show the court proof!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,63,Phoenix,(Grr... How am I supposed to prove what's going on in that old codger's head? That's impossible!)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,64,Karma,"Hmph! I'm glad you've come to your senses, Mr. Wright. Very well, witness. Please continue."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,65,Uncle,"Er... I mean, I'd need one of those ""motive"" things, right? And I don't got one."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,66,Phoenix,"How can you say you had no motive? I say you do! You had a grudge against Edgeworth and the victim, Robert Hammond! That's why you took revenge on them! Right?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,67,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,68,Karma,"Please don't make me repeat myself, Mr. Wright! This witness has no memory of anything beyond several years ago! He can't hold a grudge! It's impossible!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,69,Phoenix,"(I have to prove he's lying about his memory... Otherwise, it's going to be the same thing over and over until the trial ends!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,70,Judge,"Might I say something, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,71,Phoenix,"Yes... Yes, Your Honor?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,72,Judge,"You've been saying the same thing now over and over. You've been calling the witness's memory of the past or lack thereof into question. But, does this really have anything to do with the current case?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,73,Phoenix,"Of course, Your Honor. The witness has said he has ""nothing to do with this case"" and ""no motive""... Both of these statements are lies!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,74,Judge,Order! Order! Mr. Wright! There is a serious problem with your claim! Or... are you saying... Are you saying you know who this witness is!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,75,Phoenix,"Of course, Your Honor!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,76,Karma,"Ho hoh! Now, this is interesting. I would like to know myself! So, who is he?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,77,Phoenix,(Don't play dumb von Karma!)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,78,Judge,"Mr. Wright, please tell us this witness's name."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,79,Phoenix,"His name is Yanni Yogi, a former court bailiff!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,80,Judge,... Yogi...? That name seems familiar. ... Oh! Yanni Yogi! From the DL-6 Incident!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,81,Phoenix,(I thought the judge would have heard of it... it was such a famous case.)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,82,Judge,"But, what does this mean?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,83,Phoenix,"Your Honor! If this man is Mr. Yogi, then he has a clear motive!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,84,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,85,Karma,"Tsk tsk tsk... Jumping to conclusions again, Mr. Wright! This man, this witness, is Yanni Yogi? Fascinating! However... How do you propose to prove this to the court?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,86,Phoenix,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,87,Karma,"This is a court of law, as you may recall. You need proof! And, allow me to repeat, once more, that the witness has lost his memory!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,88,Phoenix,"(This is it... I have to do this now! If I can't prove he's Yogi right here, right now... Then I've got nowhere else to go!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,89,Maya,Nick! How are you going to prove it!? How can you prove that he's Yanni Yogi?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,90,Phoenix,"It's okay. It's actually quite simple. Your Honor! Please take this man's fingerprints! Then, we'll compare them to the fingerprints on file for Yanni Yogi 15 years ago..."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,91,Judge,I see... that makes sense.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,92,Karma,Tsk tsk tsk!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,93,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,94,Karma,"I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,95,Phoenix,Wh-why?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,96,Karma,The witness... has no fingerprints!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,97,Phoenix,What? What!? No fingerprints!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,98,Uncle,"Er... you see, before I worked as a caretaker, I worked at a chemical plant. I burned my fingers working with the stuff. Ayup."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,99,Phoenix,"Wh-what!? (Yogi, you sneak! You burned your fingerprints off to hide your past!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,100,Judge,"Hmm... Well, if the witness has no fingerprints... I guess we will not be able to prove his identity."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,101,Phoenix,(No...!)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,102,Karma,"Tsk tsk tsk... Well, what will you do, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,103,Phoenix,Uh...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,104,Karma,"Hmm? It seems that the case has been decided, no?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,105,Phoenix,(No!!! I know what happened! I know everything! I... I just can't prove it! But no... I can't let it end like this. I can't lose! There has to be another way!)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,106,Karma,There is no one who can testify as to who this witness is! No one!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,107,Maya,Nick! What are we going to do!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,108,Phoenix,I didn't even consider that he might have erased his fingerprints... (What do I do!?)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,109,Karma,"Tsk tsk tsk... Well, Mr. Wright? Perhaps you'd like to cross-examine the parrot for a little comic relief, hmm?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,110,Phoenix,"(Yeah, yeah, very funny. You're a sore winner, von Karma. ... Wait a second... ""Cross-examine the parrot""?)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,111,Maya,"Wh-what is it, Nick? No... you're not going to...!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,112,Phoenix,Your Honor! The defense would like to take Mr. von Karma up on his proposal!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,113,Judge,Take Mr. von Karma up?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,114,Karma,On his... proposal?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,115,Phoenix,"Exactly, Your Honor! I would like to cross-examine the witness's pet parrot!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,116,Judge,"O-order! Order! Uh... well, what do you think, Mr. von Karma?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,117,Karma,Need you even ask!? This is a farce! I object!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,118,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,119,Phoenix,"Wait a second! You were the one who suggested I cross-examine the parrot, von Karma! I have a right to do as you suggested!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,120,Karma,"Mmph... ... Well, if you're so desperate, then please, be my guest."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,121,Phoenix,!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,122,Karma,"Of course, should you go through with this... And nothing comes of it, then I hope you're ready for the consequences."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,123,Maya,Nick... this is crazy!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,124,Karma,Well? Still want to go through with your little game!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,125,Phoenix,"Let the parrot take the stand. I will cross-examine her, Your Honor."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,126,Judge,!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,127,Karma,This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,128,Phoenix,"(von Karma's rigged every person's testimony, every piece of evidence... Except the parrot! She's my last chance! At least... I think so.)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,129,Judge,Bailiff! Bring in the parrot.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,130,Judge,That's... quite a bird. Please tell us your name?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,131,Parrot,"""..."""
Turnabout goodbyes,6,132,Judge,Name!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,133,Parrot,"""..."""
Turnabout goodbyes,6,134,Judge,The witness is ignoring me.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,135,Phoenix,(It must be hurt... to be ignored by a bird.)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,136,Judge,"Ahem. Very well, witness... Who is your owner? Please, er... testify for us."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,137,Parrot,"""Hello! Hello!"" *squawk*"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,138,Parrot,"""..."""
Turnabout goodbyes,6,139,Judge,"Hmm... Certainly the most concise testimony we've had so far. Very well, begin your cross-examination."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,140,Phoenix,Right...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,141,Maya,"What are you going to do, Nick?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,142,Phoenix,"... I... I don't know! What do we do, Maya?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,143,Maya,Hmm...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,144,Parrot,"""Hello! Hello!"" *squawk*"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,145,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,146,Phoenix,"Witness! You can't just say ""hello"" and expect us to get anywhere! I want you to testify! Maya, you talk to her."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,147,Maya,R-right! Uh... What do I say?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,148,Phoenix,(Maybe I should get her to say her name?)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,149,Maya,Polly! Polly! What's your name?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,150,Parrot,"""Pol-ly! Pol-ly!"" *squawk*"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,151,Judge,"Mr. Wright... I think we've established that this parrot is named ""Polly."" Does this have anything to do with her owner's identity?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,152,Phoenix,Yes it does!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,153,Judge,!!!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,154,Karma,Hah! Fascinating! You claim that the parrot's name will prove her owner's identity? Then show us this proof!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,155,Maya,Nick! Don't you think you're taking the bluffing a little too far?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,156,Phoenix,"Listen. We've not here to answer the question of ""who is the caretaker."" We're here to prove that he is Yanni Yogi! All we have to do is tie the name ""Polly"" to Yogi!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,157,Phoenix,Your Honor. The proof that the parrot's name reveals the caretaker's identity is...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,158,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,159,Judge,The DL-6 Case File?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,160,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,161,Karma,"That's quite a large file you have there! Which page is this ""proof"" on, then? Show us, or stop wasting our time!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,162,Judge,"Hmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, please show us the page. Where in this file is the information connected to this parrot's name?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,163,Phoenix,"It's on the ""Suspect Data"" page!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,164,Judge,...?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,165,Phoenix,"This page has all the information about Yanni Yogi! Right after he was arrested, his fiancee committed suicide, see?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,166,Judge,"Hmm... Indeed, it does say that, yes."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,167,Phoenix,What was his fiancee's name?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,168,Judge,"""Polly Jenkins""... ""Polly""!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,169,Phoenix,"Exactly, Your Honor! He remembered the name of his fiancee who committed suicide. That's why he named his parrot after her!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,170,Judge,I see! I guess that is possible.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,171,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,172,Karma,"Bah! A mere coincidence, that's all! My granddaughter has a dog she calls ""Phoenix."" Well, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Does this make you my granddaughter's fiancee!? She's only seven years old!!!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,173,Judge,"Hmm... Indeed. Alone, it is a little weak for evidence in a murder trial. We would need some other corroborating evidence..."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,174,Phoenix,(Where am I going to find that!?)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,175,Maya,Nick! We're getting closer! One more! If we can just get one more piece of evidence...!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,176,Phoenix,(Right... but what?)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,177,Karma,Hmph!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,178,Judge,"Very well, witness. You may continue."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,179,Parrot,"""Hello! Hello!"" *squawk*"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,180,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,181,Phoenix,"Witness! You can't just say ""hello"" and expect us to get anywhere! I want you to testify! Maya, you talk to her."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,182,Maya,R-right! Uh... What do I say?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,183,Phoenix,(Maybe I'll get her to say the number of that safe...)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,184,Maya,Huh? The safe? Why?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,185,Phoenix,"Let's just try to get her to say anything, okay?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,186,Maya,Polly! What was the number of the safe in the shack?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,187,Parrot,"""1228... 1228..."""
Turnabout goodbyes,6,188,Judge,"... My, what a reckless parrot. Well, Mr. Wright? You aren't claiming that this number has something to do with the caretaker?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,189,Phoenix,Actually it does! That's why I had her say it!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,190,Karma,Hah! Ridiculous! How can the number to a safe tell us who the caretaker is? Show us your proof! What could possibly link this number to the caretaker's true identity!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,191,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,192,Karma,The DL-6 Case File? What is this obsession you have with that case?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,193,Judge,Mr. Wright. Where in this file is something relating to the safe number?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,194,Phoenix,"It's on the ""Case Summary"" page!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,195,Judge,The Case... Summary?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,196,Phoenix,"Specifically, the date on which the DL-6 Incident occurred!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,197,Judge,"The date of the incident? December 28...? Why, that's today's date. Fifteen years ago!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,198,Phoenix,And the number on that safe is 1228!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,199,Judge,Ah!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,200,Phoenix,"He used the date of the DL-6 Incident as the number for his safe, Your Honor! That's how important that date was to him!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,201,Judge,I see... it certainly is an interesting coincidence. People often do set their secret numbers to dates.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,202,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,203,Karma,"Bah! This is not tangible proof! I set my ATM card's number to ""0001"" because I'm number one! This has nothing to do with a date! Nothing!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,204,Judge,That's enough! I think we've reached a conclusion here.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,205,Karma,"This is a mere coincidence, that's all!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,206,Judge,"True, that is a possibility. However, two coincidences at the same time seems more like a ""pattern"" to me."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,207,Karma,Wh... what are you saying!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,208,Judge,Summon the caretaker of the boat shop. Immediately!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,209,Judge,Witness... Tell us your name.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,210,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,211,Karma,"Wait! This witness, he doesn't remember..."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,212,Uncle,No... it's okay.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,213,Phoenix,...!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,214,Uncle,I've accomplished what I wanted to do. I'm done.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,215,Maya,Nick! He looks totally different!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,216,Phoenix,"This is the real Yogi, I think. Finally. He's been acting feeble to hide his true identity. Acting... for 15 years!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,217,Judge,W-well...! Let me ask you again. Please state your name for the court!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,218,Yogi,"My name... is Yanni Yogi. 15 years ago, I served as a bailiff in this very court."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,219,Judge,Order! Order! Yanni Yogi! So was it you who killed Robert Hammond...? And tried to frame Miles Edgeworth for his death?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,220,Yogi,"... Yes. It was me. I did it. ... They put me on the witness stand 15 years ago... Robert Hammond... he said I was mentally unsound. He told me it would make me innocent. Get me off the hook. So... I pretended to have brain damage... I was innocent, really! But he didn't believe me! We won the trial... But I lost everything. I lost my job, my fiancee, my social standing... ... Then, this year, 15 years later... A package arrived. It was a letter... and a pistol. The plan was written out in careful detail. It was a plan to take my revenge on the people who ruined my life. I didn't care who had sent it. I thought this was my chance, after 15 years, this was it! Finally, a chance to have my revenge on Robert Hammond and Miles Edgeworth... I have no regrets."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,221,Judge,W-wait a moment! Revenge... against Miles Edgeworth? What do you mean?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,222,Yogi,"I'm not at liberty to speak on that matter. Why don't you ask Mr. Edgeworth yourself? Anyway, I admit it, I was the one who killed Robert Hammond."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,223,Judge,von Karma... Where is Mr. Yogi?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,224,Karma,"Under arrest, Your Honor. I saw no room for error in his confession."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,225,Judge,"Then... the defendant, Miles Edgeworth is..."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,226,Karma,"Innocent. In this case, at least."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,227,Judge,Hmm. Very well. Will the defendant please take the stand?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,228,Judge,"There are a few mysteries left unsolved. Still, you are cleared of suspicion for this particular case. So I would like to pass judgment on the murder of Mr. Robert Hammond. Any objections?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,229,Phoenix,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,230,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,231,Karma,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,232,Phoenix,(I don't believe it! Why isn't von Karma saying anything?)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,233,Judge,"Very well. This court finds the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth..."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,234,Judge,Not Guilty
Turnabout goodbyes,6,235,Judge,That is all. The court is adjourned!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,236,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,237,Judge,"D-did someone just say ""objection""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,238,Phoenix,"(It wasn't von Karma...! Wait, but that means...) No... Edgeworth!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,239,Edgeworth,Your Honor. I object to your judgment.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,240,Judge,Wh-what do you mean?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,241,Edgeworth,"I'm not innocent at all! As we have heard, Yanni Yogi killed Robert Hammond in revenge. But, revenge for what?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,242,Maya,Nick! Edgeworth is trying to confess! He's going to say he's guilty! He's going to tell them he was the murderer in the DL-6 Incident! He's going to tell them he killed his own dad!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,243,Phoenix,(Uh oh! What do I do?)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,244,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,245,Phoenix,The judgment has already been passed! I object to Edgeworth's outburst...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,246,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,247,Karma,"Didn't something like this happen yesterday, too? I believe a certain witness raised an objection after a guilty verdict was passed."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,248,Phoenix,(That would be Larry...)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,249,Karma,We must hear this new statement! We must hear Miles Edgeworth!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,250,Judge,He's right. We have a duty to hear Mr. Edgeworth out.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,251,Edgeworth,"For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream. A nightmare... it's only a nightmare. That's what I told myself. But now I know, it wasn't a dream. Yanni Yogi wasn't the killer."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,252,Judge,You mean... in the incident where your father died?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,253,Edgeworth,"From the distance of the shot, it wasn't suicide, either. Everything was as clear as day. The murderer... The criminal in the DL-6 Incident... It was me! Your Honor! I confess my guilt! I am guilty for DL-6, the statute of limitations of which ends today! The culprit... is me!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,254,Judge,"Order! Order! This is certainly unexpected! The defendant, declared innocent, is confessing to another crime! A crime for which the statute of limitations runs out today! I'm not really sure how I should deal with this..."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,255,Karma,Bah! It's obvious. We hold a trial. Right here. Right now. We try this man for his crime of fifteen years ago!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,256,Judge,"I think... I think I would like to take a five minute recess. During this time, I will consider the appropriate course of action to take. Court is adjourned!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,257,Edgeworth,"I'm sorry, Wright. I've just wasted all of your effort."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,258,Gumshoe,"... Mr. Edgeworth... I just don't believe it, pal! I mean, you... kill your dad?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,259,Edgeworth,"I didn't want to believe it myself, Detective! But... it's the truth. I deserve to be punished. Murder is murder, no matter what the circumstances."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,260,Gumshoe,This is crazy! Just crazy!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,261,Maya,... ...? Nick? What are you doing?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,262,Phoenix,Huh? Oh... I was just reading through the Court Record once more. I'm getting my case ready.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,263,Maya,Your case... for what?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,264,Phoenix,Huh? Isn't it obvious? I'm going to prove that Miles Edgeworth is innocent.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,265,Gumshoe,"...! Wh-what are you talking about, pal! He just admitted to it! He confessed that he did it! In court!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,266,Phoenix,"I'm sorry, Edgeworth. But I don't believe in your ""nightmare."""
Turnabout goodbyes,6,267,Edgeworth,Wh-what!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,268,Phoenix,"It's just a dream. It's not real. The truth is right here in this Court Record. In any case, tighten your belts. The real fight is just beginning. I'll prove you're innocent. Trust me."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,269,Edgeworth,W-Wright...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,270,Judge,"Then, I would like to resume our trial."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,271,Karma,"Judge! Miles Edgeworth has admitted his own guilt. He has confessed his crime. Let us begin by hearing his testimony. Then, though pointless, let the defense do their cross-examining. The statute of limitations on the DL-6 Incident runs out today. Though it's unconventional for me, I'd like to run this one by the book."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,272,Judge,I see. Does the defense have any objections?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,273,Phoenix,"No, Your Honor. (von Karma... you knew this was going to happen from the very beginning, didn't you!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,274,Judge,Very well. Will Miles Edgeworth take the stand?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,275,Karma,Will the witness state his name and profession.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,276,Edgeworth,Miles Edgeworth... I am a prosecuting attorney.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,277,Karma,"Mr. Edgeworth. Fifteen years ago, you mistakenly killed your father, Gregory Edgeworth. Is this correct?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,278,Edgeworth,... It is correct.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,279,Karma,Then testify about this matter to the court.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,280,Phoenix,(When Edgeworth was telling me about his dream yesterday I noticed something... One detail didn't quite fit. That will be the key... but only if I can get it to work!)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,281,Maya,Please... Please...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,282,Judge,"Hmm... And, until now, you thought this memory was a ""dream""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,283,Edgeworth,"We were stuck in that elevator for five hours. The oxygen in the elevator ran out, and I lost my memory of the events."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,284,Karma,Bah! The same claim Mr. Yogi has made!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,285,Judge,"Very well. Mr. Wright? Your cross-examination, please."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,286,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,287,Edgeworth,"That day, I had gone to the courtroom to observe one of my father's trials."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,288,Phoenix,What was the trial your father was involved in on that day?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,289,Edgeworth,"I don't remember things very clearly. Only two things... I know my father lost, and Mr. von Karma was the prosecuting attorney."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,290,Judge,Mr. von Karma? You were handling that case?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,291,Karma,It was fifteen years ago. I don't remember the details.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,292,Phoenix,(That was when Edgeworth pointed out the problem in von Karma's evidence...)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,293,Edgeworth,"As we went to leave, an earthquake struck, trapping us in the elevator."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,294,Phoenix,"So, there were three people including yourself trapped in that elevator?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,295,Edgeworth,"Yes. Myself, my father, and Yanni Yogi. We were fine at first... But then as time passed, and no one came to help..."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,296,Edgeworth,"My father and Mr. Yogi lost their composure, and began to argue."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,297,Phoenix,What did you do then?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,298,Edgeworth,"I was a nine-year-old boy at the time. What could I do? I was scared... Trembling, in the corner. But then..."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,299,Edgeworth,"Just then, something heavy fell at my feet."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,300,Phoenix,What was it?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,301,Edgeworth,"A pistol. I assume it was the bailiff, Yanni Yogi's. The safety must have come off when it fell from his holster."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,302,Karma,And you picked it up. What happened next?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,303,Edgeworth,"I picked it up, and threw it at Mr. Yogi. I wanted them to stop fighting."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,304,Phoenix,Did you know it was a pistol when you threw it?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,305,Edgeworth,I think I knew. I knew it was dangerous. But... the air was getting so thick. I panicked.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,306,Karma,"So, you're saying that you threw the pistol at Mr. Yogi."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,307,Edgeworth,I was... in a daze.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,308,Edgeworth,"A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,309,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,310,Phoenix,The gun fired once?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,311,Edgeworth,"Yes... I think... after I threw it, I lost consciousness. Since then... They've echoed in my head, every day. That gunshot, and that horrible scream."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,312,Phoenix,The scream...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,313,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,314,Phoenix,Are you sure you only heard one gunshot?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,315,Edgeworth,"Yes. I'm sure of that. I heard the shot, and the scream... Then everything faded. I was unconscious until the rescuers came."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,316,Judge,I see...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,317,Phoenix,But that doesn't make sense! Look at this file one more time. This plainly contradicts the witness's testimony.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,318,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,319,Karma,"You do enjoy dragging out that file, don't you? I don't accept this evidence! Unless... you can tell us what page it's on! Which page contradicts Miles Edgeworth's testimony?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,320,Phoenix,"Look at the ""Victim Data"" in this file! It says quite plainly: ""the murder weapon was fired twice""! Miles Edgeworth only heard one gunshot! Yet, the murder weapon was fired twice! The first shot was the accidental firing when the pistol was thrown. So... who fired the remaining shot!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,321,Judge,"Hmm... Was there, perhaps, another shooter who fired that second shot?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,322,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,323,Karma,"Your Honor. As I'm sure you're aware... This incident occurred fifteen years ago. The evidence is dated... The pistol did fire twice. However, we do not know WHEN that second shot was fired. It might have been fired the day before the incident! There is no proof that the second shot had anything to do with this incident!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,324,Phoenix,(What...!)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,325,Judge,"Hmm... I see, I see. You do have a point. Mr. Wright? The murder weapon was fired twice, as we have heard. One of those shots was fired by the defendant, a boy at the time. Do you have any proof that the other shot fired had something to do with the case?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,326,Phoenix,Your Honor. I think I will be able to show you proof.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,327,Karma,Wh-what!? Impossible!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,328,Judge,"Now, now, Mr. von Karma. Save your surprise for after you've seen the evidence. Very well, Mr. Wright. Show us your proof. Do you have evidence that the second firing of the pistol is related to this incident?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,329,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,330,Phoenix,Look at this photograph.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,331,Judge,"This is a photograph of the scene of the crime, fifteen years ago. I can see that the victim lying there is Gregory Edgeworth..."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,332,Phoenix,"This proves the murder weapon was fired twice, at the time of the incident! This photo proves it!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,333,Karma,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,334,Judge,"... So, let me get this straight. This photo proves two shots were fired? Where?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,335,Phoenix,"(Y-Your Honor, please... Please get a clue! Show the judge the contradiction in the photo!)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,336,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,337,Phoenix,"As should be obvious, the contradiction is here."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,338,Judge,I see... a bullet hole in the door...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,339,Phoenix,"Your Honor! Gregory Edgeworth was killed by a shot from the pistol! Yet, there is also a bullet hole in the elevator door! We also know that the murder weapon was fired twice! Thus... Someone other than Edgeworth fired that second shot!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,340,Judge,O-order! Order! Mr. Wright! What are you driving at?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,341,Phoenix,"It's simple, Your Honor. At the time of the incident, two shots were fired. One went into Gregory Edgeworth's heart. The other hit the elevator door. Remember that the defendant lost consciousness after the shot he fired rang out. In conclusion... We must agree that the second shot was fired by someone else!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,342,Judge,M-Mr. Wright! But who could that someone else be!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,343,Phoenix,"The murderer, of course!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,344,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,345,Karma,"... I knew I should have stepped in before your wild fantasies got out of hand. Mr. Wright... Look once more at the DL-6 Incident case file. Look closely. Try the ""Case Summary"" page."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,346,Phoenix,"(The ""Case Summary""... that's on page 1.)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,347,Karma,"Look what is written there! ""Not a single clue was found on the scene."""
Turnabout goodbyes,6,348,Phoenix,...!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,349,Karma,If the pistol had indeed been fired two times... Then the other bullet would have been discovered on the scene!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,350,Judge,He does have a point.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,351,Karma,That second bullet has never been found! Why? Because the second bullet does not exist! The bullet that claimed Gregory Edgeworth's life was the one fired by his own son! That is the truth of this matter. The whole truth. It was undoubtedly something else that made that bullet hole in the door.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,352,Judge,"Order! I will have order! ... Mr. Wright has proven one thing to us quite clearly... That the murder weapon was fired twice at the time of the incident. However! As Mr. von Karma says, the second bullet was not found. It is highly unlikely that the police merely overlooked this second bullet. So, all we have is the single bullet fired. I'm afraid I have to discount the defense's claim."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,353,Karma,Tsk tsk tsk... I praise the judge for his wisdom in his matter.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,354,Phoenix,(Gah! How did this happen!? I don't believe that the second bullet didn't exist! Was I wrong? Have I been wrong about this whole incident?)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,355,Maya,"What are you doing, Nick!? Why aren't you raising an objection!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,356,Phoenix,"... I'm sorry, Maya."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,357,Maya,What?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,358,Phoenix,I... It looks like I was wrong.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,359,Maya,Nick...?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,360,Phoenix,"If the second bullet wasn't there, then all my conjectures are for nothing!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,361,Maya,"N-no... But you said you'd do it, Nick! You said you'd get Edgeworth declared innocent!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,362,Phoenix,"... I'm sorry... It's just, when I saw the photograph, I thought that two shots had been fired. I was so certain of it. I thought I'd won! I thought there was another person, someone else who fired the killing shot. But now... I was wrong to think it could be that simple. This case has stood unsolved for fifteen years!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,363,Maya,Nick...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,364,Judge,"Well, it seems that we have finally cleared up this incident. Only one bullet was found at the scene of the crime. That shot was fired by Miles Edgeworth."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,365,Karma,Precisely.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,366,Judge,I would like to ask one thing of Miles Edgeworth before passing my verdict. Have you been paying attention to the trial so far?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,367,Edgeworth,"Yes, Your Honor."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,368,Judge,Do you have any objections?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,369,Edgeworth,"No... No, I do not."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,370,Judge,"So you killed your father, though that was not your intention?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,371,Edgeworth,"... Yes, I did."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,372,Maya,... Oh no... He's confessing... ...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,373,Judge,"Very well. The statute of limitations on the murder of Gregory Edgeworth runs out today. Therefore, I must pronounce a verdict on the defendant, right here..."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,374,Karma,Right now!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,375,Judge,Indeed. Does anyone have any objections?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,376,Phoenix,"(I've been here before... It's just like my first day in court... There are so many things I know I should be saying... But my mind's gone blank, I can't find the words...)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,377,Judge,Mr. Wright?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,378,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,379,Phoenix,Your Honor! I... I object!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,380,Karma,"Tsk tsk tsk. Mr. Wright, on what grounds do you object, hmm?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,381,Phoenix,Oof!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,382,Maya,Nick...?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,383,Phoenix,(I... I don't know! His case is perfect!)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,384,Maya,Oh no...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,385,Phoenix,Grah!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,386,Mia,...it must exist...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,387,Mia,...the second bullet...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,388,Phoenix,!!!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,389,Phoenix,Wh-what? What did you just say?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,390,Maya,N-nothing!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,391,Phoenix,(The second bullet must exist? But where!?)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,392,Mia,...Someone took it...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,393,Judge,... It seems waiting is not going to produce us any answers from Mr. Wright.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,394,Phoenix,"Wait, Your Honor!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,395,Judge,Hmm?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,396,Phoenix,"I, uh... Th-the second bullet! It, uh, it exists!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,397,Judge,What!? But we've just heard proof that it did not exist!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,398,Phoenix,"I-I realize that, Your Honor. (I'm really grasping here!) I-it's just, someone took it from the scene of the crime! That's what happened!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,399,Judge,But... Who!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,400,Phoenix,Th-th-the murderer!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,401,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,402,Karma,"The murderer? Then tell us, just who is this ""murderer""?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,403,Phoenix,I'm... still thinking about that one.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,404,Judge,Hmm... So the criminal took the second bullet? Why would he?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,405,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,406,Judge,"First of all, how would he have found it? It's not easy to find a stray bullet, Mr. Wright! Was there some pressing need for the murderer to search for that bullet?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,407,Phoenix,(Why would the murderer have spent the time to look for that stray bullet...? I haven't got a clue!)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,408,Judge,"What's wrong, Mr. Wright?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,409,Phoenix,Uh... Um...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,410,Karma,"Bah! The murderer had no reason to take that bullet! You don't want to admit it, but it's true!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,411,Phoenix,Urk...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,412,Mia,...had to take it...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,413,Phoenix,(Had to take it...? The murderer? What does that mean?)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,414,Mia,...you're thinking too normal... think crazy...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,415,Mia,...don't think why the bullet was taken...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,416,Mia,...think why the bullet HAD to be taken...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,417,Judge,Mr. Wright?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,418,Phoenix,"Y-yes, Your Honor! (I have no idea what I'm doing...) U-uh, well, the murderer had no intention of taking the bullet from the scene. But... uh, the murderer HAD to take that bullet."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,419,Judge,"""Had to,"" Mr. Wright? What do you mean?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,420,Phoenix,"Well, for instance... (For instance WHAT!?) Uh, maybe the bullet, uh... hit the murderer?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,421,Judge,The bullet... hit the murderer?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,422,Phoenix,"J-just saying, for instance. I mean, if it hit you, you would have to take it with you, wouldn't you? It's not like you could perform surgery right there. Y-y'know?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,423,Judge,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,424,Karma,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,425,Phoenix,"(Wait a second... I was just talking off the top of my head, but what if that's really what happened?)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,426,Judge,"Let me get this straight. So at the time of the murder, the murderer himself was shot? And he left with the second bullet still inside!? Thus leaving only one bullet at the scene of the crime?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,427,Phoenix,"Uh, yes... I guess that's how it would work, yes."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,428,Judge,But there's a problem with that! The other two people rescued from that elevator... Miles Edgeworth and Yanni Yogi were both unharmed! So that would mean...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,429,Phoenix,"The murderer came from outside, yes."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,430,Phoenix,"The two men fight inside the elevator. Trying to stop them, the boy picks up the pistol at his feet and throws it. The pistol discharges, and the bullet... The bullet goes through the elevator door and hits the murderer outside! The boy loses consciousness... Then the murderer opens the elevator door and sees the men inside..."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,431,Judge,"Hmm. Mr. Wright. You are truly the most unpredictable defense attorney I've ever known. I can tell you're grasping, yet I cannot deny the possibility of what you say."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,432,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,433,Karma,"What are you saying! Deny it! Deny it! No one involved with the incident was wounded! There was no ""murderer""!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,434,Judge,Hmm...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,435,Phoenix,(No one was wounded at the time of the incident... He's right. I can't think of anyone...)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,436,Maya,"Hey, Nick."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,437,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,438,Maya,I just thought of something really crazy.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,439,Phoenix,Crazy?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,440,Maya,Remember what Mr. Grossberg said yesterday?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,441,Grossberg,Gregory Edgeworth dealt a blow to his perfect trial record.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,442,Maya,Wow.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,443,Grossberg,"It must have been quite a shock for von Karma. He took a vacation for several months after that, you see. Yes, an unusual event for the man. That was the first, and last vacation he's taken in his many years of prosecuting."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,444,Maya,What if von Karma didn't take that vacation because of shock...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,445,Phoenix,But took it because he was injured!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,446,Maya,Which would mean...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,447,Phoenix,It could only mean one thing!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,448,Maya,He was the murderer in the DL-6 Incident!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,449,Phoenix,He was the man who shot Gregory Edgeworth!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,450,Maya,It was... von Karma!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,451,Phoenix,(Oh man!)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,452,Judge,"Something wrong, Mr. Wright? You seem... dazed."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,453,Phoenix,"Uh, n-no, Your Honor."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,454,Judge,Well? You have indicated the possibility that the murderer came from outside. Can you give us the name of your suspect?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,455,Phoenix,(Uh oh. Should I come out and say it now!?)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,456,Phoenix,Your Honor! There is a suspect... one lone suspect!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,457,Karma,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,458,Judge,"Well, this is certainly interesting news. Very well, Mr. Wright. Who is your suspect?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,459,Phoenix,V-V-V... (Urk! My h-hands are shaking!)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,460,Judge,V-what?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,461,Phoenix,von Karma!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,462,Edgeworth,von Karma!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,463,Karma,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,464,Judge,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,465,Judge,"You mean, THE von Karma? The prosecutor? Sitting right there?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,466,Karma,Bah.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,467,Judge,You... don't object?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,468,Karma,Hmph. I see no need. Why honor this ridiculous outburst with my objection?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,469,Phoenix,Because you took a vacation for several months starting the day after the incident! Yet you pride yourself on a perfect record! Why would you take such a long vacation without any reason!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,470,Karma,"So you're claiming that I took a vacation to heal my ""injury"" from the incident? Fascinating! Prove it. I would have needed surgery, no? Where did I go under the knife at, Mr. Wright!? Bring the doctor that operated on me! Have him testify!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,471,Phoenix,Urk...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,472,Maya,Nick! Let's find out who his doctor is!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,473,Edgeworth,It's no use.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,474,Phoenix,E-Edgeworth!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,475,Edgeworth,I know von Karma. Perhaps too well. He's perfect. He wouldn't leave clues. He probably didn't undergo surgery. That would leave a doctor as a witness.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,476,Phoenix,(Grr... Nobody's that perfect!)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,477,Maya,"So... so what, Nick? Did von Karma pull the bullet out by himself!? That's insane!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,478,Phoenix,No... he couldn't have. You can't just pull bullets out of yourself! ... (Wait... What does that mean...? That bullet has to be somewhere! But... where?)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,479,Karma,"Tsk tsk tsk... Well, Mr. Wright! Can you produce evidence to prove that I was shot?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,480,Phoenix,"Alright, von Karma. I'll prove it. And I'll even use evidence... I know how you like it so much."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,481,Karma,Wh-what!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,482,Phoenix,The evidence that proves von Karma was shot is...!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,483,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,484,Phoenix,"von Karma is perfect... He wouldn't risk surgery, leaving an evidence trail. So then, I ask, where is that bullet now? I think it unlikely that von Karma performed surgery on himself!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,485,Judge,...! You... you don't mean!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,486,Phoenix,I do. There is the possibility that the bullet is still inside von Karma!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,487,Judge,I-is that even possible? For all these years!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,488,Phoenix,"Well, there's one way to find out. We could use this metal detector! Well, von Karma? I'm going to run this over you, and see what we find."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,489,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,490,Karma,... I... refuse!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,491,Judge,"Y-you refuse...!? But, refusing this means... You acknowledge that the bullet is still inside you? Order! Order! Order!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,492,Phoenix,Your Honor! The defense requests that we be allowed to use the metal detector!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,493,Karma,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,494,Karma,Judge! I call for a suspension of this trial! This is an invasion of privacy!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,495,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,496,Phoenix,"The statute of limitations runs out on this case today! It was you who said we had to end it right here, right now!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,497,Karma,Mm... mmmph!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,498,Judge,"Enough! I permit the use of the metal detector. Mr. von Karma, you will submit yourself for testing!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,499,Maya,Nick! What does this mean...?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,500,Phoenix,I don't know... but we have to give it a shot!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,501,Metal Detector,*beep* *beep* *beeeeeep*
Turnabout goodbyes,6,502,Phoenix,(It reacted! Something's inside his right shoulder! The bullet!)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,503,Phoenix,... Mr. von Karma...?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,504,Edgeworth,... You! It was you!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,505,Karma,"... I was afraid this would happen. And so, I remained silent."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,506,Phoenix,...?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,507,Karma,"Indeed, there is a bullet in my shoulder. However... it has nothing to do with this incident!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,508,Phoenix,What!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,509,Karma,I was shot in the shoulder long before the DL-6 Incident! I claim that the bullet in my shoulder has no relation to DL-6!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,510,Judge,"B-but, Mr. von Karma! Can you prove that?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,511,Karma,"""Prove""? I have no obligation to prove anything! It is you who must prove something here, Mr. Wright! Not I."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,512,Judge,M-Mr. Wright? Well? Can you prove it? Can you prove that the bullet in von Karma's shoulder was from DL-6?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,513,Karma,Of course he can't! You don't have any of the DL-6 evidence!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,514,Phoenix,(That's because you took it out of the Records Room yesterday!)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,515,Karma,"With no proof, you cannot convict me of any crime! So sorry, Mr. Wright."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,516,Phoenix,"No... I'm the one who's sorry, Mr. von Karma."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,517,Karma,Wh-what!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,518,Phoenix,You were close... one day away from freedom. You see... I have proof!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,519,Karma,Wh-what!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,520,Phoenix,Who would have thought you would have dug your own grave trying to convict Edgeworth! I can link that bullet in your shoulder to the DL-6 Incident... And here's my final proof!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,521,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,522,Judge,Th-that's... A bullet?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,523,Karma,Where did you get that!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,524,Phoenix,"This is the bullet used in the DL-6 Incident. This was taken from the heart of the victim, Mr. Gregory Edgeworth. The bullet is preserved quite nicely, with all the ballistic markings intact."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,525,Edgeworth,Ballistic markings...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,526,Phoenix,"You may recall the term. It came up in the first trial, two days ago."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,527,Judge,"Ballistic markings are the fingerprints of a weapon. All bullets fired from a gun are marked with that weapon's unique pattern. By examining the markings, you can tell which weapon fired the bullet. It's quite accurate."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,528,Phoenix,"We have two bullets in our possession. One, the bullet removed from Gregory Edgeworth's heart. The other, Mr. von Karma, is the bullet buried in your shoulder. We could analyze both bullets... Then, if the markings matched... We would know that both bullets had been fired from the same gun! The very same pistol... in other words, the murder weapon that killed Gregory Edgeworth!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,529,Karma,Mmmph... mmmph!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,530,Phoenix,"Mr. von Karma? You will let us remove the bullet from your shoulder. Then we'll compare the ballistic markings to those on this bullet... And solve this case once and for all! Well, Mr. von Karma!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,531,Karma,Mmmrrrrrrgggh! Uuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,532,Karma,Uaaaaarrrr... aaa...oooh. Worrrrrrrggg... aaa...oooooh...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,533,Edgeworth,That scream... I've heard that scream before... Wait... I know!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,534,Edgeworth,It's that scream I heard in the elevator! Fifteen years ago... von Karma! It was you who screamed!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,535,Judge,Mr. von Karma?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,536,Karma,Wooorrrrrrroooorrgggh Eh...Edgewoooooorrth......... ...Ehh...Edgewoooooorrth...... Only...you would... dare...defy me...!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,537,Edgeworth,So... it was you!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,538,Karma,You and your father are my curse! Your father shamed me with a penalty on my record! And you... you left a scar on my shoulder that would never fade! I... I'll bury you! I'll bury you with my bare hands! Death! Death!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,539,Judge,Mr. Chief Prosecutor... I am sorry.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,540,Judge,von Karma! It's not like you to make this kind of error... I never would have thought that Edgeworth would be the one to catch you.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,541,Karma,I... was careless.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,542,Judge,"I'm sorry, but you will have to be penalized. I've covered for you in the past, but not this time."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,543,Karma,...! Edgeworth!!!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,544,Karma,"It was a shock like none I had ever known. Me? Penalized!? It took hours for me to regain my composure. Suddenly, I found myself in the darkness... I was in the court records room. I must have wandered in there without thinking where I was going. The room was pitch black. The lights must have gone out. I went out in the hall and felt my way to the elevator. I pressed the button, and nothing happened. Then... there was a noise! I was in pain! A horrible, burning pain in my shoulder! Just then, the lights came back on. The elevator door opened before my eyes. I saw three people inside, all lying unconscious from oxygen deprivation. Much to my surprise, a pistol lay at my feet. I knew then... it was destiny. In his last moments, Gregory Edgeworth was still unconscious. He died, never knowing who had shot him. Later, he spoke through a medium, blaming Mr. Yogi. He was fooled! It was the perfect crime!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,545,Karma,Tsk tsk tsk... Who would have thought another man would have come to open that elevator door? Judge!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,546,Judge,Wh-what?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,547,Karma,What are you doing!? Do your job! Bring an end to this miserable charade! Now! End it!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,548,Judge,V-very well.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,549,Judge,It appears that we have come a very long way to the end of this maze. Fifteen years later... Mr. Miles Edgeworth?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,550,Edgeworth,"Yes, Your Honor."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,551,Judge,You were innocent. You are innocent.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,552,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,553,Judge,"As you said, it was all a ""nightmare."""
Turnabout goodbyes,6,554,Edgeworth,"Yes, Your Honor."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,555,Judge,"This court finds the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth..."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,556,Judge,Not Guilty
Turnabout goodbyes,6,557,Judge,That is all. The court is adjourned!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,558,Maya,"Nick! Nick! We did it! Did you see his face!? von Karma looked even paler than usual! He's pretending to be all cool, but inside you crushed him, Nick! Crushed! I gotta say, I'm impressed."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,559,Phoenix,"Heh... It was pretty close, though. I was sure we'd had it."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,560,Maya,"I know, I was on the verge of tears the whole time, myself. But now it's all just a good memory!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,561,Edgeworth,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,562,Phoenix,"So, it's finally over, Edgeworth."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,563,Edgeworth,... Wright.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,564,Phoenix,Yeah?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,565,Edgeworth,... I... I'm not sure how to say this.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,566,Maya,"I know! I know! Try ""thank you."""
Turnabout goodbyes,6,567,Edgeworth,"I... I see. ... Th-thank you, Wright."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,568,Phoenix,Y-you're welcome.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,569,Maya,I think you could have done better than that!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,570,Edgeworth,Oof! S-sorry... I'm not good at this sort of thing.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,571,Maya,"You got a lot to learn, Edgeworth!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,572,Phoenix,"(Dear, dear...)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,573,Gumshoe,"Whoooooooooooooop! Amazing, pal! You pulled through just like I thought you would! I'll never forget this! I owe you one, pal. And tonight, let's party! Dinner's on me! Yeah, my salary went down again a bit this month... But who cares!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,574,Maya,"See, Mr. Edgeworth? You should take a lesson from Detective Gumshoe! That's how you say ""thank you""!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,575,Edgeworth,Mmm. I... I see. *ahem* Whooooooooooooop! ... I... I feel foolish.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,576,Maya,Don't worry. Take it a little at a time. You'll get used to it.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,577,Phoenix,(It's been fifteen years since I've seen Edgeworth this... unguarded.)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,578,Lotta,"Hey, y'all!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,579,Maya,Lotta!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,580,Lotta,Y'all were great in there!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,581,Phoenix,Thank you!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,582,Lotta,"Yo, Edgeworth! Congrats!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,583,Edgeworth,Er... thank y'all very much.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,584,Lotta,"I knew you were innocent from the start, of course. Just look at you! You wouldn't stick your hand in the cookie jar even if no one was there!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,585,Edgeworth,"You... were the witness on the first day of the trial, weren't you."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,586,Lotta,"Yeah, well, let bygones be bygones, eh?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,587,Phoenix,"Speaking of which, what are you doing now, Lotta?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,588,Lotta,"Who, me? Aww, I went back to college. I gave up trying to be an investigative photographer pretty quick."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,589,Phoenix,Really? That's too bad.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,590,Lotta,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,591,Phoenix,?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,592,Lotta,Isn't that the hotdog guy from the park?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,593,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,594,Butz,"It's over, Nick! My life is over!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,595,Phoenix,"Wh-why the sad face, Larry!? What happened now!?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,596,Butz,"Oh, Nick... I'm not long for this world."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,597,Phoenix,Uh... you don't look sick...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,598,Butz,"It's Kiyance! Sh-she's goin' to live in Paris! Paris, Nick! She's leaving me behind!!!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,599,Phoenix,"(Larry, Larry...)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,600,Butz,"Yo, Edgey! There you are!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,601,Edgeworth,"Um, yes, here I am."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,602,Butz,"Congrats, Edgey! Here... a little gift from me in celebration!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,603,Edgeworth,Celebration? That's unusual for you.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,604,Gumshoe,"Harry Butz! You come along tonight too! My treat, pal!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,605,Butz,"Huh? Uh... thanks! Looking forward to it! (Yo, yo, Nick! That's the suit that questioned me! When he says treat... that's not police-talk for prison food, right? Right?)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,606,Phoenix,"Uh, I think you'll be fine, Larry."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,607,Edgeworth,Wright...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,608,Phoenix,Yeah? What's up?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,609,Edgeworth,That envelope that Larry gave me. It's got money in it.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,610,Phoenix,"Well, yeah. That's not that strange. People give money away to celebrate sometimes."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,611,Edgeworth,"It's $38.00, Wright."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,612,Phoenix,"Huh. What a weird amount. I mean, it's not a little, but it's not a lot either. ... $38.00 exactly?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,613,Maya,N-N-Nick! Wasn't that exactly the amount of lunch money that was stolen from Mr. Edgeworth in school!?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,614,Phoenix,"$38...! No... No!!! Larry, it was you!!!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,615,Edgeworth,"What are you so surprised about, Wright?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,616,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,617,Edgeworth,"Larry was absent that day from school, right? But that doesn't automatically rule him out as a suspect."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,618,Phoenix,What?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,619,Edgeworth,"Think back to that day, fifteen years ago. Larry took the day off, but he was bored, he came in to school anyway. Then he saw the money lying there... and the rest is history."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,620,Butz,I never was good at History! Heh...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,621,Phoenix,"... Edgeworth... you didn't know, did you?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,622,Edgeworth,"I suspected. I just couldn't picture Larry protecting you like he did that day. Everyone else was saying you did it. The whole class was against you, remember?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,623,Phoenix,Yeah... too well.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,624,Edgeworth,"Wright, you may not know this, but we used to have a saying back in school. ""When something smells, it's usually the Butz."""
Turnabout goodbyes,6,625,Phoenix,"I know, I know."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,626,Edgeworth,"Really, Wright. I'm surprised you didn't figure it out!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,627,Butz,"Well, this is sure an unexpected turn of events, eh?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,628,Phoenix,Edgeworth...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,629,Edgeworth,Hmm?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,630,Phoenix,You should have told me!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,631,Maya,"Now, now, Nick. It was fifteen years ago! Don't you think the ""statute of limitations"" has run out, Mr. Edgeworth?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,632,Edgeworth,"I'd say so, yes."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,633,Butz,There you have it!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,634,Phoenix,Grr... Where does that leave me!? I became a defense attorney because of what you two did!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,635,Edgeworth,"Well, I'd call you a goody-two-shoes to the extreme."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,636,Butz,"Yeah! And you get worked up too easily, too!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,637,Phoenix,"D-death! The death sentence for both of you! Man, if only I had known, I'd have become a prosecutor!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,638,Edgeworth,"The same goes for me, only the other way around... For the longest time, I thought that I might have killed my own father. I thought I might be a criminal. I became a prosecutor in part to punish myself. If I had known the truth, I might have become a defense attorney after all."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,639,Phoenix,Edgeworth...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,640,Edgeworth,"Want to switch, Wright?"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,641,Lotta,"Hey, y'all! Line up, I'll take a photo!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,642,Maya,"Hey, photo time! Let's go!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,643,Gumshoe,"And after that, dinner on me!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,644,Phoenix,"Detective Gumshoe took us out on the town that night. We celebrated Edgeworth's new found freedom. Although, Edgeworth was still in detention."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,645,Phoenix,Whoa... I went a little overboard yesterday. My head hurts... Huh? It's still only 5:00. Maybe I should go back to sleep... Hmm? (What's this? A letter?)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,646,Maya,"Good morning, Nick. You were really impressive yesterday. Seeing you... It made me think about what I'm doing here. I'm a spirit medium... in training, of course. I wanted to help Mr. Edgeworth too. I wanted to help you. But I couldn't. I was useless. So, I've decided to go back to my training. I'll become a full-fledged spirit medium, for starters. I couldn't say it to your face, so I left this letter. Goodbye, Nick."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,647,Phoenix,(G-goodbye!?) What time is it? Gah! The first trains for the mountains have already left! To the station!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,648,Phoenix,... I guess I'm too late... ...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,649,Maya,Hey! N-Nick!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,650,Phoenix,Maya!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,651,Maya,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,652,Phoenix,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,653,Maya,...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,654,Phoenix,So... you're leaving?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,655,Maya,"Yeah. It's hard being a spirit medium who can't talk to spirits. And... I think you'll do fine without me, Nick. Be good... okay!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,656,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,657,Phoenix,W-wait!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,658,Maya,What?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,659,Phoenix,... I never could have saved Edgeworth without your help.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,660,Maya,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,661,Phoenix,On the last day of the trial... I heard her. I heard Mia's voice!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,662,Maya,You heard my sister...?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,663,Phoenix,"Yes... only her voice, but still... It was at the very end when I thought we'd lost everything."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,664,Maya,"Well, that's my sister for you. Detective Gumshoe helped, and Mr. Grossberg, and even Larry... I'm the only one who couldn't help. I was useless, Nick."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,665,Phoenix,"But you were the one who stopped von Karma, Maya!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,666,Maya,Huh? I-I didn't do anything! All I did was wander around in a daze...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,667,Phoenix,"Sorry, but I have evidence that you helped!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,668,Maya,E-evidence?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,669,Phoenix,(Show Maya some evidence to cheer her up!)
Turnabout goodbyes,6,670,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Turnabout goodbyes,6,671,Maya,A bullet...?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,672,Phoenix,von Karma was convinced he had taken all of the evidence pertaining to DL-6! But you were the one who rescued the last piece of evidence we needed! This was the bullet that put an end to von Karma! And you were the one who gave it to me!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,673,Maya,Nick...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,674,Phoenix,"Thanks, Maya. I couldn't have done it without you."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,675,Maya,... ... I'll be back soon.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,676,Phoenix,Huh?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,677,Maya,"I'm going to complete my training, and come back!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,678,Phoenix,... Okay. I'll be waiting. ...
Turnabout goodbyes,6,679,Maya,Of course you will. You can't run that office by yourself! You're hopeless!
Turnabout goodbyes,6,680,Phoenix,"Uh, I don't know about that..."
Turnabout goodbyes,6,681,Maya,So... bye.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,682,Phoenix,Bye.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,683,Maya,Thanks... Nick.
Turnabout goodbyes,6,684,Edgeworth,"Hah! Don't think you've graduated yet, amateur!"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,685,Judge,Mr. Wright. Perhaps you'd like to rethink that claim?
Turnabout goodbyes,6,686,Phoenix,"Er... yes, Your Honor. (Uh oh... I got a bad feeling about this...)"
Turnabout goodbyes,6,687,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,1,0,Phoenix,It's been two months since Maya left the office... Two months without a single trial. I've had offers... But none I took. That is... until the day that girl showed up.
Rise from the ashes,1,1,Phoenix,(Why do I come here to the office every day? It's not like I want to work...)
Rise from the ashes,1,2,Ema,There you are! Finally! Where have you been!? My sister's trial is tomorrow!
Rise from the ashes,1,3,Phoenix,... ... Um... who are you?
Rise from the ashes,1,4,Ema,"It doesn't matter who I am! It only matters who YOU are! You're the famous defense attorney, Mia Fey!"
Rise from the ashes,1,5,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,1,6,Ema,...
Rise from the ashes,1,7,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,1,8,Ema,"Oh, uh... You're not Mia Fey, are you?"
Rise from the ashes,1,9,Phoenix,"I'm sorry, but Ms. Mia Fey no longer... works here."
Rise from the ashes,1,10,Ema,So you are...? The coffee boy?
Rise from the ashes,1,11,Phoenix,I'm Phoenix Wright... A defense attorney.
Rise from the ashes,1,12,Ema,Wright... Wright... Wait! You're THE Phoenix Wright!? The Phoenix Wright from the Edgeworth murder case!?
Rise from the ashes,1,13,Phoenix,"Um, yes, that's correct. (It wasn't Edgeworth who was murdered, though...)"
Rise from the ashes,1,14,Ema,That's a relief then! You're better than nobody!
Rise from the ashes,1,15,Phoenix,I'm sorry... I'm afraid I'm not taking cases right now.
Rise from the ashes,1,16,Ema,"But, you are Phoenix Wright, right? The undefeated defense attorney?"
Rise from the ashes,1,17,Phoenix,"Look, I'm not accepting any new cases. I'm sorry, but you'll have to try elsewhere."
Rise from the ashes,1,18,Ema,Please! I'm out of time!
Rise from the ashes,1,19,Phoenix,But...
Rise from the ashes,1,20,Ema,"Please, you have to help! I-it's my sister!"
Rise from the ashes,1,21,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,1,22,Phoenix,(Maya...? Could it be...?)
Rise from the ashes,1,23,Phoenix,... Okay. I'll hear you out.
Rise from the ashes,1,24,Ema,"R-really!? Thank you so much! My name's Ema, Ema Skye. I'm a scientific investigator."
Rise from the ashes,1,25,Phoenix,(Scientific investigator?)
Rise from the ashes,1,26,Phoenix,"Ema, was it? So you're a ""scientific investigator""?"
Rise from the ashes,1,27,Ema,Yes! That's right! Is... something wrong?
Rise from the ashes,1,28,Phoenix,"No, it's just, you seem kind of, er, jumpy. Or maybe just... young?"
Rise from the ashes,1,29,Ema,Young? I'll be sixteen years old this year!
Rise from the ashes,1,30,Phoenix,"Oh, I see... wait! Only sixteen!?"
Rise from the ashes,1,31,Ema,"I'm set to be formally assigned to Forensics in three more years. My work is becoming quite well known... At my age, no less!"
Rise from the ashes,1,32,Phoenix,"Um, so what exactly is your current position, then?"
Rise from the ashes,1,33,Ema,"Well, legally speaking... I guess you'd call me an ""Eleventh Grader."" But I'm ready to do my job! At my age, no less!"
Rise from the ashes,1,34,Phoenix,"(Great, another future professional in training...)"
Rise from the ashes,1,35,Phoenix,So what's this about a case? You said the trial's tomorrow?
Rise from the ashes,1,36,Ema,My sister didn't do it! She wouldn't stab someone with a knife! She wouldn't!
Rise from the ashes,1,37,Phoenix,So... it's a murder case.
Rise from the ashes,1,38,Ema,I don't care if there's a witness who saw her do it! She didn't do it! I know she didn't do it! It's a scientific fact!
Rise from the ashes,1,39,Phoenix,And... there's a witness.
Rise from the ashes,1,40,Ema,J-just talk to her! You have to talk to her!
Rise from the ashes,1,41,Phoenix,Right... I suppose I will.
Rise from the ashes,1,42,Ema,"I promised her I'd bring Mia Fey, but..."
Rise from the ashes,1,43,Phoenix,(That's interesting... How would she know Mia?)
Rise from the ashes,1,44,Phoenix,"So, you want to be a scientific investigator when you grow up, then?"
Rise from the ashes,1,45,Ema,"E-excuse me? I'm not a child, I'll have you know!"
Rise from the ashes,1,46,Phoenix,"Still, it's good to have a goal. Albeit a very unusual one."
Rise from the ashes,1,47,Ema,I believe investigations should be done scientifically! Don't you?
Rise from the ashes,1,48,Phoenix,"Uh, yeah. (Sure can't fault her for a lack of enthusiasm.)"
Rise from the ashes,1,49,Ema,"If this case is handled scientifically, I'm sure my sister's name will be cleared!"
Rise from the ashes,1,50,Phoenix,Your sister...?
Rise from the ashes,1,51,Ema,"I've been doing research, you know! I'm developing a new scientific method of case investigation! I'll show you when I'm done!"
Rise from the ashes,1,52,Phoenix,I'm looking forward to it. (Guess I should get down to the Detention Center and talk to her sister.)
Rise from the ashes,1,53,Ema,My sister asked for her specifically. Mia Fey... was a few years below her in school.
Rise from the ashes,1,54,Phoenix,(So she went to the same school as Mia.)
Rise from the ashes,1,55,Ema,"She always told me to go to Mia if I ever needed a defense attorney... And, well... I need one."
Rise from the ashes,1,56,Phoenix,"Um, incidentally, Mia is a woman."
Rise from the ashes,1,57,Ema,"Mia... Yeah, I thought it was a little strange when I saw you, too."
Rise from the ashes,1,58,Phoenix,"Well, it's nice of you to help your sister out like this. You must be close."
Rise from the ashes,1,59,Ema,...
Rise from the ashes,1,60,Phoenix,?
Rise from the ashes,1,61,Ema,"Well... Actually, when she gets like she is now, I kind of hate her."
Rise from the ashes,1,62,Phoenix,(Huh?)
Rise from the ashes,1,63,Ema,But... But she's my only family.
Rise from the ashes,1,64,Phoenix,Your only family? What about your parents?
Rise from the ashes,1,65,Ema,They died in a car accident when I was little.
Rise from the ashes,1,66,Phoenix,Oh... I'm sorry.
Rise from the ashes,1,67,Ema,...
Rise from the ashes,1,68,Phoenix,"(Hmm, I wonder what's wrong with Ema? She got quiet all of a sudden as soon as we arrived.)"
Rise from the ashes,1,69,Lana,Guard... I thought I told you I didn't want visitors.
Rise from the ashes,1,70,Guard,"S-s-s-sorry, ma'am! It's j-j-just, your sister..."
Rise from the ashes,1,71,Lana,"No excuses! Or did you not want a raise this year, hmm?"
Rise from the ashes,1,72,Guard,"U-u-u-understood, ma'am!"
Rise from the ashes,1,73,Phoenix,(Wh-wh-wh-what was that all about?)
Rise from the ashes,1,74,Ema,"H-hi, Lana."
Rise from the ashes,1,75,Lana,Funny. I seem to remember specifically telling you NOT to come here. Perhaps my memory is failing?
Rise from the ashes,1,76,Ema,"L-look... I didn't want to come here either, okay? But your trial's tomorrow and you still don't have a defense attorney!"
Rise from the ashes,1,77,Lana,"I'll be the one in court tomorrow. This has nothing to do with you, Ema. Isn't that right, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,1,78,Phoenix,Hey! How do you know me?
Rise from the ashes,1,79,Lana,Mia mentioned you. I've heard... quite a bit.
Rise from the ashes,1,80,Phoenix,"Er, I'm sorry. What exactly is it that you do...?"
Rise from the ashes,1,81,Lana,"My name is Lana, Lana Skye."
Rise from the ashes,1,82,Lana,I'm Chief Prosecutor for this district.
Rise from the ashes,1,83,Phoenix,"Y-you're a prosecutor!? (Two sisters... one a lawyer. Could this be a coincidence? Ema... Lana... I mean, they're just like...)"
Rise from the ashes,1,84,Ema,"Is something wrong, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,1,85,Lana,There's something you should know from the start.
Rise from the ashes,1,86,Phoenix,W-which is?
Rise from the ashes,1,87,Lana,The suspect in this case has confessed to the crime.
Rise from the ashes,1,88,Phoenix,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,1,89,Ema,W-wait! But the suspect... The suspect is...!
Rise from the ashes,1,90,Lana,"Me. I did it. Well, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,1,91,Phoenix,Well... why don't you begin by telling me exactly what happened.
Rise from the ashes,1,92,Lana,"The crime took place yesterday, February 21, at 5:15 PM."
Rise from the ashes,1,93,Phoenix,That's quite specific.
Rise from the ashes,1,94,Lana,It was in the witness's deposition. A witness clearly saw me committing the crime.
Rise from the ashes,1,95,Phoenix,"Uh... My, that was a bit of bad luck, wasn't it?"
Rise from the ashes,1,96,Lana,The crime took place in the underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office. The body was found in the trunk of my subordinate's car.
Rise from the ashes,1,97,Phoenix,"The Prosecutor's Office, huh? (In your subordinate's car trunk? Classy...)"
Rise from the ashes,1,98,Lana,"I was arrested on the spot. Caught red-handed, as it were."
Rise from the ashes,1,99,Phoenix,"(My, my...)"
Rise from the ashes,1,100,Phoenix,"So, who was the victim?"
Rise from the ashes,1,101,Lana,"An investigator with the Police Department. I suppose the correct term is ""Detective."""
Rise from the ashes,1,102,Ema,A detective...?
Rise from the ashes,1,103,Lana,Death was due to a loss of blood. He was stabbed once in the stomach.
Rise from the ashes,1,104,Phoenix,By... you?
Rise from the ashes,1,105,Lana,"Death wasn't immediate, but the wound was fatal."
Rise from the ashes,1,106,Phoenix,I see...
Rise from the ashes,1,107,Lana,"Allow me to repeat myself, Mr. Wright. The victim was a detective. You know what that means, don't you?"
Rise from the ashes,1,108,Phoenix,Uh oh!
Rise from the ashes,1,109,Ema,What? Mr. Wright? What does it mean?
Rise from the ashes,1,110,Phoenix,"Well, it means..."
Rise from the ashes,1,111,Lana,The police department will consider it a matter of pride to have me found guilty. They will use any means at their disposal to do so.
Rise from the ashes,1,112,Phoenix,(This case gets worse and worse with everything I learn.)
Rise from the ashes,1,113,Phoenix,"So, you're the Chief Prosecutor?"
Rise from the ashes,1,114,Lana,"That is correct. I'm responsible for overseeing every trial handled by prosecutors in this district. I make sure the prosecutors have what they need to do the job, and manage every aspect. Those are my responsibilities, in a nutshell."
Rise from the ashes,1,115,Phoenix,(That's an awfully large nutshell.)
Rise from the ashes,1,116,Lana,"Still, I'm a little surprised. I would think you'd recognize the district's Chief Prosecutor, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,1,117,Phoenix,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,1,118,Lana,"In fact, it seems impossible you wouldn't..."
Rise from the ashes,1,119,Ema,Um... Lana? What happened to your hand?
Rise from the ashes,1,120,Lana,"Oh, this? I cut myself by accident. When I stabbed him, that is."
Rise from the ashes,1,121,Ema,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,1,122,Lana,"I'm not very good at being a criminal, I suppose."
Rise from the ashes,1,123,Phoenix,"(How am I supposed to defend this!? Time to change the subject... Wait, she was in the class ahead of Mia, wasn't she...?)"
Rise from the ashes,1,124,Phoenix,"Um, you were in school with Mia, correct? A few years above her?"
Rise from the ashes,1,125,Lana,"... Ema told you that, too, did she?"
Rise from the ashes,1,126,Ema,"W-well, why not? I did drag him all the way here from his office!"
Rise from the ashes,1,127,Lana,Although it seems he has very little in common with Mia...
Rise from the ashes,1,128,Phoenix,(Hey!)
Rise from the ashes,1,129,Lana,"It was in law school. I was in my third year, and she was auditing the class. She was different than the other students."
Rise from the ashes,1,130,Phoenix,Different?
Rise from the ashes,1,131,Lana,She was strong... She'd do anything to become a defense attorney. Anything. That... was probably why she was attracted to me.
Rise from the ashes,1,132,Phoenix,E-excuse me!?
Rise from the ashes,1,133,Ema,Intellectually attracted! Lana was top of her class in school.
Rise from the ashes,1,134,Lana,I was the best there was.
Rise from the ashes,1,135,Phoenix,Oh...
Rise from the ashes,1,136,Ema,"I'm doing pretty good in school too, by the way!"
Rise from the ashes,1,137,Phoenix,(It sounds a bit different when Ema says it...)
Rise from the ashes,1,138,Lana,"Well, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,1,139,Phoenix,E-excuse me?
Rise from the ashes,1,140,Lana,"As you can plainly see, I am admitting my guilt. I think it's safe to say... there's no way you can take this case. None."
Rise from the ashes,1,141,Ema,"B-but, Lana!"
Rise from the ashes,1,142,Lana,...
Rise from the ashes,1,143,Ema,"You... you were always this way, weren't you? You never think of anyone but yourself."
Rise from the ashes,1,144,Lana,...!
Rise from the ashes,1,145,Ema,"I know you didn't do it, Lana, I know! So... So how can you say you did!?"
Rise from the ashes,1,146,Lana,...
Rise from the ashes,1,147,Ema,"If I lose you... I'll be all alone! I... I hate you, Lana!"
Rise from the ashes,1,148,Lana,... Mr. Wright?
Rise from the ashes,1,149,Phoenix,Y-yes?
Rise from the ashes,1,150,Lana,I believe our discussion here is ended. The rest... I leave to you.
Rise from the ashes,1,151,Phoenix,"...! Um... you mean, you're requesting my services as your defense?"
Rise from the ashes,1,152,Lana,"Don't lose any sleep over it. Your client has confessed, after all. The case is over."
Rise from the ashes,1,153,Phoenix,Right... I'll do what I can to get to the bottom of this.
Rise from the ashes,1,154,Lana,...
Rise from the ashes,1,155,Phoenix,"(Lana has confessed to the crime, yes... But something doesn't fit. It's that look in Ema's eyes. There's something else going on here... and I'm going to find out what!)"
Rise from the ashes,1,156,Ema,"I'm sorry, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,1,157,Phoenix,Huh? About what?
Rise from the ashes,1,158,Ema,My sister... She's not always like that you know.
Rise from the ashes,1,159,Phoenix,... I just never expected to be defending another prosecutor again.
Rise from the ashes,1,160,Ema,"She's changed a lot. She used to be so gentle, always smiling. Everybody liked her."
Rise from the ashes,1,161,Phoenix,"I see... (Sorry, but I'm having trouble imagining that.) What happened to her?"
Rise from the ashes,1,162,Ema,"I don't know for certain myself... I think maybe she... Well, maybe not."
Rise from the ashes,1,163,Phoenix,"(Sounds like there's something there that defies a simple scientific explanation.) Let's go check out this underground parking at the Prosecutor's Office, shall we?"
Rise from the ashes,1,164,Ema,O-Okay!
Rise from the ashes,1,165,Phoenix,So this is the lot where it all happened?
Rise from the ashes,1,166,Ema,Looks like they're still investigating...
Rise from the ashes,1,167,Phoenix,(Funny that my first visit to the Prosecutor's Office should be like this...)
Rise from the ashes,1,168,Ema,Hey everyone! Keep up the good work!
Rise from the ashes,1,169,Phoenix,H-hey! What are you thinking?
Rise from the ashes,1,170,Ema,"Well, they are going to be my coworkers three years from now after all. No harm in saying hello..."
Rise from the ashes,1,171,Phoenix,"Actually, there is. You know attorneys aren't supposed to examine crime scenes?"
Rise from the ashes,1,172,Phoenix,"I'm trying to not stand out too much, here, see?"
Rise from the ashes,1,173,???,"Hey there! You 'specting to go unnoticed here, pardner?"
Rise from the ashes,1,174,Ema,P-Pardner?
Rise from the ashes,1,175,???,"What do we have here? Looks like a bambina got loose from the ranch and is up to no good! Folks gotta learn to keep them dogies tied down, pardner."
Rise from the ashes,1,176,Ema,M-Mr. Marshall!
Rise from the ashes,1,177,Phoenix,(Marshall? Looks more like a sheriff to me...)
Rise from the ashes,1,178,???,"Lookie here, bambina. I know how you feel. But this is my gang's gold strike, see?"
Rise from the ashes,1,179,Ema,Strike...?
Rise from the ashes,1,180,???,"This is our claim, our territory. And the goldmine is... evidence. If you're fixin' to mess with what's ours... You'll regret it, pardner! You know what dreams the cacti out in the desert dream? You want to?"
Rise from the ashes,1,181,Phoenix,(What's this guy talking about!?)
Rise from the ashes,1,182,???,"You head along home now. Happy trails, bambina!"
Rise from the ashes,1,183,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,1,184,Ema,...
Rise from the ashes,1,185,Phoenix,"Was that uh, hombre, a friend of yours?"
Rise from the ashes,1,186,Ema,Uh... kind of... sort of... Yeah. He's a detective.
Rise from the ashes,1,187,Phoenix,(Who thinks he's a sheriff from the Wild West it seems.)
Rise from the ashes,1,188,Ema,Ah hah! A ladder.
Rise from the ashes,1,189,Phoenix,Um... That's a stepladder.
Rise from the ashes,1,190,Ema,"What's the difference? In scientific terms, please."
Rise from the ashes,1,191,Phoenix,"S-scientific, huh?"
Rise from the ashes,1,192,Ema,"Look at the basic nature of things, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,1,193,Phoenix,(This all seems so horribly familiar somehow...)
Rise from the ashes,1,194,Phoenix,What's this? A wallet?
Rise from the ashes,1,195,Phoenix,"Um, excuse me! Officer!"
Rise from the ashes,1,196,Ema,"W-w-waaaait! What are you doing, Mr. Wright!?"
Rise from the ashes,1,197,Phoenix,"What am I doing? I just found this wallet, so I'm handing it over to the police..."
Rise from the ashes,1,198,Ema,"I don't believe it! This is real basic: anything at a crime scene is evidence! Let's be scientific about this, please! Just put it in your pocket."
Rise from the ashes,1,199,Phoenix,H-how is that scientific? (Sounds like theft to me!)
Rise from the ashes,1,200,Ema,"I'm called to duty already, and at my tender age! Here, I'll teach you the trick to examining evidence in detail, okay?"
Rise from the ashes,1,201,Phoenix,"(By the way her eyes are sparkling, I can tell she's been waiting for this...)"
Rise from the ashes,1,202,Ema,"Okay, okay, now. Look at the Court Record! You have to be sure to examine evidence carefully on all sides! Now. Let's start examining! From every angle!"
Rise from the ashes,1,203,Ema,Oh look! I think there might be a clue there. You should check it out! Press the Examine button.
Rise from the ashes,1,204,Phoenix,"This... This is an ID card. (Detective Bruce Goodman, ID # 5842189...)"
Rise from the ashes,1,205,Ema,See? Well? Isn't scientific investigation useful?
Rise from the ashes,1,206,Phoenix,"I guess... Though I don't see what ""science"" has to do with it."
Rise from the ashes,1,207,Ema,Let's be sure to examine every piece of evidence we find!
Rise from the ashes,1,208,Phoenix,(I guess I've got to be on my toes from now on...)
Rise from the ashes,1,209,Ema,"Well, no time to waste! Let's get hunting for clues! Hmm... I wonder what this is?"
Rise from the ashes,1,210,???,"Well, pardner. Looks like you got no intention of going home quietly."
Rise from the ashes,1,211,Phoenix,(The sheriff!)
Rise from the ashes,1,212,???,"Like I said before, this here's our claim. You'd best be moseying along. Unless you're fixing to bite the bullet."
Rise from the ashes,1,213,Phoenix,(Gah! Scary!)
Rise from the ashes,1,214,Ema,C-could you just tell us one thing...? Who owns that car?
Rise from the ashes,1,215,???,"Well, well. The little filly's got a good nose on her! You want to know who rides that red mustang with the body in her saddle, eh?"
Rise from the ashes,1,216,Ema,Please!
Rise from the ashes,1,217,???,"No problem, pardner. 'Bout time for vittles anyway. Get yourself to the saloon up on the 12th floor of the Prospector's Office. Might just find you a cervesa you like."
Rise from the ashes,1,218,Phoenix,"(Prospector's Office? Where does this guy think he is? And when, for that matter!?)"
Rise from the ashes,1,219,Ema,"Note to self: look up vittles, saloon, cervesa."
Rise from the ashes,1,220,Phoenix,(Maybe we should check out room 1202... the High Prosecutor's Office!)
Rise from the ashes,1,221,???,"In any case, stay away from the car. You can look around here all you like, just keep your paws off our claim."
Rise from the ashes,1,222,Phoenix,(Right... great.)
Rise from the ashes,1,223,Ema,"Great! Maybe there are some clues around here, Mr. Wright! Let's check it out!"
Rise from the ashes,1,224,Angel,Excuse me? Were you two all set?
Rise from the ashes,1,225,Ema,Us?
Rise from the ashes,1,226,Phoenix,(What's this? She couldn't be...)
Rise from the ashes,1,227,Ema,Y-you're selling lunches? Here? This is a crime scene!
Rise from the ashes,1,228,Angel,"Hello! Half n' Half, was it?"
Rise from the ashes,1,229,Ema,"Oh. Uh, thanks."
Rise from the ashes,1,230,Angel,"And you, sir?"
Rise from the ashes,1,231,Phoenix,Y-yes?
Rise from the ashes,1,232,Angel,Some Crunchy Goodness coming at you!
Rise from the ashes,1,233,Phoenix,Uh... thanks. (Interesting way of doing business.)
Rise from the ashes,1,234,Angel,This area is off limits to anyone without clearance. Especially passers-by. Or are you officers?
Rise from the ashes,1,235,Ema,"Uh... no, but you... You don't exactly look like the type to have clearance."
Rise from the ashes,1,236,Angel,"Well, that's hardly a way to greet someone! Even if my days as the ""Cough-up Queen"" are over..."
Rise from the ashes,1,237,Phoenix,C-cough-up? Huh?
Rise from the ashes,1,238,Ema,"You know, I'm feeling kind of full. Maybe I'll pass on lunch..."
Rise from the ashes,1,239,Angel,"I'm quite connected to this case, you see. The images are burned into my eyes, you might say. Yes, all the sordid secrets..."
Rise from the ashes,1,240,Ema,Secrets...?
Rise from the ashes,1,241,Angel,"Dear me. You are a slow one, aren't you? I'm referring to the murder. The stabbing of that detective."
Rise from the ashes,1,242,Phoenix,Whaaaat!?
Rise from the ashes,1,243,Lana,A witness clearly saw me committing the crime.
Rise from the ashes,1,244,Ema,You mean you're the witness my sister was talking about?
Rise from the ashes,1,245,Phoenix,Please! Cough-up Queen! Tell us what happened!
Rise from the ashes,1,246,Angel,The name is Angel Starr. Don't you go forgetting it. Or before you know it I'll have you whimpering at my heels.
Rise from the ashes,1,247,Phoenix,"Y-y-yes, ma'am! (Yipes! She means it!)"
Rise from the ashes,1,248,Angel,Somehow... I knew. Yesterday was a day of destiny... I knew something was going to happen... Just like I know that the Daily Special on Friday every week is salmon.
Rise from the ashes,1,249,Phoenix,Destiny...? Was yesterday special for some reason?
Rise from the ashes,1,250,Angel,"You're a defense attorney, right? You should know then. You should know the foul misdeeds of the evil ones who haunt this den of inequity!"
Rise from the ashes,1,251,Ema,E-evil ones?
Rise from the ashes,1,252,Angel,"Prosecutors! They have no qualms at all about blackening the name of innocents! And yesterday they paid homage to the most evil one of all! They gave an award for ""King of Prosecutors""... What a farce!"
Rise from the ashes,1,253,Ema,"So, she's saying... There was some sort of prosecutor's convention yesterday."
Rise from the ashes,1,254,Angel,I was almost compelled to lace their lunches with something foul...
Rise from the ashes,1,255,Ema,"Do you have a personal grievance against prosecutors, or something? Or is there some kind of scientific evidence of this, um, ""evil""?"
Rise from the ashes,1,256,Angel,"Young miss... Mock me at your own risk! You'll soon find out why they call me the ""Cough-up Queen""!"
Rise from the ashes,1,257,Ema,Ew!
Rise from the ashes,1,258,Angel,"The most heinous of all the evil ones, the one they awarded yesterday... It was in his car that they found the body! Proof that he devours the evilest lunches of all!"
Rise from the ashes,1,259,Ema,R-really!?
Rise from the ashes,1,260,Phoenix,(Really what? I'm totally confused... One thing's clear. This lunch lady has a thing against prosecutors.)
Rise from the ashes,1,261,Phoenix,"So, what exactly was it that you witnessed, Ms. Starr?"
Rise from the ashes,1,262,Angel,"It was a fascinating spectacle, to be sure! I now feel I know what they say when they talk about a ""woman's wrath."" To see Lana Skye wield that knife so..."
Rise from the ashes,1,263,Phoenix,!
Rise from the ashes,1,264,Angel,"Her knife flashed in anger, bringing him to a sad end. It was truly a sight to see."
Rise from the ashes,1,265,Ema,Y-you mean you saw the very moment of the crime!?
Rise from the ashes,1,266,Angel,The sound of his silvery ties to this world being cruelly cut still rings in my ears. And the rhythmic beat of Lana Skye's knife...
Rise from the ashes,1,267,Phoenix,Wait a second! You know Lana Skye?
Rise from the ashes,1,268,Angel,"Hmph. Of course. It's quite a feat... becoming Chief Prosecutor. How many lunchboxes of sin did she pack to make that journey, I wonder!"
Rise from the ashes,1,269,Ema,She... always travels light.
Rise from the ashes,1,270,Phoenix,(Now why would this pretty lunch lady know the Chief Prosecutor's name?)
Rise from the ashes,1,271,Ema,"Um... Could we ask you a bit about yourself, Ms. Starr?"
Rise from the ashes,1,272,Angel,"I come here every day to sell lunches. I import only the freshest and best from the Far East. For some reason, the box lunches are a hit here."
Rise from the ashes,1,273,Ema,Why not make the lunches here rather than import them?
Rise from the ashes,1,274,Angel,Did you say something?
Rise from the ashes,1,275,Ema,N-no...
Rise from the ashes,1,276,Angel,Only true connoisseurs can understand... The kind you can only tell someone who has tried General Tso's Trilobite lunch set.
Rise from the ashes,1,277,Ema,Ah... Nevermind... You win.
Rise from the ashes,1,278,Phoenix,(I don't even want to appreciate part of a trilobite's flavor.)
Rise from the ashes,1,279,Angel,"Anyway, I come here every day to sell lunches. My boyfriend works in the security room here at the Prosecutor's Office."
Rise from the ashes,1,280,Ema,Y-your boyfriend?
Rise from the ashes,1,281,Angel,See the security room over there?
Rise from the ashes,1,282,Phoenix,The glass-walled booth?
Rise from the ashes,1,283,Angel,"I sell my lunches and, since I'm here anyway, I drop in to see him."
Rise from the ashes,1,284,Phoenix,(Since you're here anyway... I guess selling lunches is more important than romance.)
Rise from the ashes,1,285,Ema,"So, to scientifically analyze the data available so far... You, Ms. Starr, are a lunch vendor with an ulterior motive for coming here!"
Rise from the ashes,1,286,Phoenix,(Useful analysis. Not.)
Rise from the ashes,1,287,Phoenix,"Did you have a bad experience with a prosecutor, Ms. Starr? I sense some... hostility."
Rise from the ashes,1,288,Angel,"Hostility? Hah! Perhaps. Prosecutors are all alike. And the bigger they get, the worse they smell. Kind of like 10-day old clams in the chowder."
Rise from the ashes,1,289,Phoenix,(I wonder if Ms. Starr was involved in some sort of legal trouble in the past?)
Rise from the ashes,1,290,Ema,"That'd be a sure cause of food poisoning! Scientifically speaking, of course. I mean, now you're talking ""Cough-up Queen""!"
Rise from the ashes,1,291,Phoenix,"(I thought she was just a lunch vendor, but now I'm not so sure...)"
Rise from the ashes,1,292,Ema,"This is the kind of room that just screams ""I can do the job."" Quite a change from your office, really."
Rise from the ashes,1,293,Phoenix,Thanks.
Rise from the ashes,1,294,Ema,"Look, look! There's a trophy or something here!"
Rise from the ashes,1,295,Phoenix,"(A trophy? What, that shield?)"
Rise from the ashes,1,296,Ema,"It takes real nerve to display stuff like this. Whoever's office this is, he must be a real stuck-up jerk!"
Rise from the ashes,1,297,Edgeworth,"Mr. Phoenix Wright... You never tire of prying into other people's business, do you?"
Rise from the ashes,1,298,Phoenix,"(That voice...!) Long time, no see, Edgeworth."
Rise from the ashes,1,299,Ema,Huh? Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! M-M-Mr. Edgeworth!
Rise from the ashes,1,300,Phoenix,...! You know him from somewhere?
Rise from the ashes,1,301,Ema,"O-of course! I'm his biggest fan! My sister introduced us once, and..."
Rise from the ashes,1,302,Phoenix,"(Right... her sister was the Chief Prosecutor, after all.)"
Rise from the ashes,1,303,Edgeworth,Well? What brings you here? I'll warn you... I've been known to be a real stuck-up jerk...
Rise from the ashes,1,304,Ema,"N-no! Did I...? No! It was just, Mr. Wright here, he..."
Rise from the ashes,1,305,Phoenix,Hey! Don't blame me!
Rise from the ashes,1,306,Ema,W-we're just here to investigate a murder case!
Rise from the ashes,1,307,Edgeworth,Murder...?
Rise from the ashes,1,308,Ema,"A body was found in this nasty, bright red sports car in the parking lot..."
Rise from the ashes,1,309,Edgeworth,Hmm? That would be my car. What of it?
Rise from the ashes,1,310,Ema,Whaaaaaaaaaaaa!? Y-y-y-your car!?
Rise from the ashes,1,311,Phoenix,"(I'll say one thing, she certainly can scream.)"
Rise from the ashes,1,312,Phoenix,"So, the body was found in your car?"
Rise from the ashes,1,313,Edgeworth,"Go ahead, say it, Wright. You think I did it, don't you? After you went through all that trouble to help me last year, no less."
Rise from the ashes,1,314,Ema,"N-no, we don't think you did it! I mean, it was my sister who stabbed him... Uh, wait, no, she didn't do that! I mean..."
Rise from the ashes,1,315,Edgeworth,"Wait... So you're the Chief Prosecutor's little sister, then?"
Rise from the ashes,1,316,Ema,"Y-yes sir! Ema Skye! It, uh... It's nice to meet you again!"
Rise from the ashes,1,317,Phoenix,(Now that didn't sound forced at all...)
Rise from the ashes,1,318,Edgeworth,"Ah, now I remember. You've... really grown. I'll admit, it was a surprise to me, too. To think that my own car would become the scene of a murder. More surprising still... Now I'm forced to prove my superior's guilt."
Rise from the ashes,1,319,Phoenix,I can understand... W-wait!... What did you say!?
Rise from the ashes,1,320,Edgeworth,"Lana Skye is the Chief Prosecutor... the top prosecutor in the district. She can't prosecute herself, so I'll be the prosecutor at the trial tomorrow."
Rise from the ashes,1,321,Ema,You!? Mr. Edgeworth...
Rise from the ashes,1,322,Edgeworth,To be honest... It's a bit of a miracle I'm still here at all.
Rise from the ashes,1,323,Phoenix,What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,1,324,Edgeworth,"Rumors. You've heard the rumors about me, haven't you?"
Rise from the ashes,1,325,Phoenix,"(Miles Edgeworth... It's hard to remember a time when there WEREN'T rumors about this guy... Forging evidence, arranging false testimony, illegal searches, you name it...)"
Rise from the ashes,1,326,Edgeworth,"Thanks to you, my innocence was established in the trial at the end of last year. However, there are some who say I'm the one responsible for the current incident."
Rise from the ashes,1,327,Phoenix,Wh-what? That's crazy!
Rise from the ashes,1,328,Edgeworth,Hmph. Some people need very little excuse to think ill of others. It's a fact of life. Impossible to stop.
Rise from the ashes,1,329,Ema,But...
Rise from the ashes,1,330,Edgeworth,Some of them even go so far as to present me with toys like this... They think it's funny.
Rise from the ashes,1,331,Phoenix,(Toys? That bronze shield? There's got to be a story behind that one...)
Rise from the ashes,1,332,Phoenix,I've been wondering... what the heck is this?
Rise from the ashes,1,333,Ema,"It has a big ""K"" on it."
Rise from the ashes,1,334,Edgeworth,*mumbles* of Prosecutors...
Rise from the ashes,1,335,Phoenix,Huh? What's that?
Rise from the ashes,1,336,Edgeworth,"It's the ""King of Prosecutors"" trophy."
Rise from the ashes,1,337,Ema,"K-K-K... ""King of Prosecutors""!?"
Rise from the ashes,1,338,Edgeworth,It's a great honor. They send that shield to the best prosecutor each year. What! So?
Rise from the ashes,1,339,Phoenix,"So that ""K""... that's..."
Rise from the ashes,1,340,Ema,"""K"" stands for ""King""?"
Rise from the ashes,1,341,Edgeworth,"Yeah, you got a problem with that? I didn't design the thing!"
Rise from the ashes,1,342,Ema,"""King of Prosecutors""... Kind of like ""Employee of the Month,"" only better!"
Rise from the ashes,1,343,Phoenix,"So, in other words, you were the best of the best this year, huh?"
Rise from the ashes,1,344,Edgeworth,"You can take that foolish grin elsewhere, Wright. I lost a day of work to receive that travesty."
Rise from the ashes,1,345,Ema,Huh? Why's that?
Rise from the ashes,1,346,Edgeworth,I had to go to the Police Department ceremony to receive that broken shield.
Rise from the ashes,1,347,Phoenix,The Police Department?
Rise from the ashes,1,348,Edgeworth,"Yes. Right next to the Police Station downtown. You've been there, correct?"
Rise from the ashes,1,349,Phoenix,Where Detective Gumshoe works? Yeah.
Rise from the ashes,1,350,Ema,"Um, I was wondering something about your shield... Why is it broken?"
Rise from the ashes,1,351,Edgeworth,What does it matter? I've got more important things to worry about.
Rise from the ashes,1,352,Ema,Oh. Right...
Rise from the ashes,1,353,Phoenix,"(He doesn't seem too concerned about his award, for better or for worse.)"
Rise from the ashes,1,354,Edgeworth,Yesterday was a very busy day for the Prosecutor's Office.
Rise from the ashes,1,355,Ema,Maybe... we should ask him more about yesterday?
Rise from the ashes,1,356,Phoenix,Could you tell me more about yesterday... the day of the murder?
Rise from the ashes,1,357,Edgeworth,Yesterday was the annual cleaning day at the Prosecutor's Office.
Rise from the ashes,1,358,Ema,Cleaning day?
Rise from the ashes,1,359,Edgeworth,"Working with the Police Department, we sort and file all evidence for solved cases. We call it ""evidence transferral."""
Rise from the ashes,1,360,Ema,"Wiping your hands of old cases, in other words."
Rise from the ashes,1,361,Edgeworth,"Oh, and another thing... A ceremony was held at the Police Department. There's an annual review and awards for outstanding police officers and prosecutors."
Rise from the ashes,1,362,Phoenix,And that's when you got the shield?
Rise from the ashes,1,363,Edgeworth,I was at the police department yesterday afternoon... I got back here at 5:12.
Rise from the ashes,1,364,Phoenix,That's... very precise.
Rise from the ashes,1,365,Ema,"People like myself and Mr. Edgeworth pride ourselves on our precision, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,1,366,Edgeworth,"No, I place little faith in my memory. The only thing I trust is solid evidence."
Rise from the ashes,1,367,Edgeworth,This is the parking stub from the underground lot.
Rise from the ashes,1,368,Phoenix,(The murder took place around 5:15...)
Rise from the ashes,1,369,Ema,So the murder happened right after you got back.
Rise from the ashes,1,370,Edgeworth,"What, Wright? I'd appreciate it if you'd direct that suspicious glare elsewhere."
Rise from the ashes,1,371,Meekins,"Um...! Excuse me! But is Mr. Edgeworth, uh... anywhere on the premises?"
Rise from the ashes,1,372,Edgeworth,I'm Edgeworth. What is it?
Rise from the ashes,1,373,Meekins,"I'm here, sir, at the request of the Chief, sir! I've got your report, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,1,374,Edgeworth,Report? What? Did you find new evidence in the case against Chief Prosecutor Skye!?
Rise from the ashes,1,375,Phoenix,(I don't like the way this conversation is going at all...)
Rise from the ashes,1,376,Meekins,"Er... Skye, sir? No, sir! No name of that kind, sir! Not in this report, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,1,377,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,1,378,Phoenix,(I think I just heard Edgeworth's lid blow.)
Rise from the ashes,1,379,Ema,"Mr. Edgeworth's lid isn't on very tight, is it?"
Rise from the ashes,1,380,Edgeworth,"I made a clear request to the Police Department, did I not? I need to focus on the trial tomorrow, so don't bring me anything unrelated!"
Rise from the ashes,1,381,Meekins,"Sir! But, but sir! I'm just following orders, sir! They told me to bring this to you! I wasn't aware of the peculiars of your arrangement with us, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,1,382,Edgeworth,Give me your name!
Rise from the ashes,1,383,Meekins,"U-uh, yes... yes, Sir! M-M-Meekins, sir. Officer Meekins!"
Rise from the ashes,1,384,Edgeworth,Right. Officer Meekins? Take your report and leave. And good luck with that raise next month.
Rise from the ashes,1,385,Meekins,"*whimper* B-but, sir, I d-didn't know!"
Rise from the ashes,1,386,Phoenix,(Poor guy. Looks like he was absent on the day they gave out brains and good luck.)
Rise from the ashes,1,387,Edgeworth,Wright.
Rise from the ashes,1,388,Phoenix,"Y-yes, sir!? (Gah! He caught me off guard!)"
Rise from the ashes,1,389,Edgeworth,"As you can see, I'm busy. You may leave now."
Rise from the ashes,1,390,Ema,"L-let's do as he says, Mr. Wright!"
Rise from the ashes,1,391,Edgeworth,The victim was a detective from the same department as that patrolman just now. Go down to the Police Department. You can ask more there.
Rise from the ashes,1,392,Phoenix,U-uh... Thanks. (He seems to have finally calmed down at least.)
Rise from the ashes,1,393,Ema,Whew... We're finally here. Why would they put the detectives so far away from the Prosecutor's Office?
Rise from the ashes,1,394,Phoenix,"That took almost 30 minutes by taxi... and traffic wasn't even that bad. This is my first time to the Police Department, actually. ? Hold on, what's that?"
Rise from the ashes,1,395,Ema,Disturbing! Why does it undulate like that?
Rise from the ashes,1,396,Phoenix,"Oh, wait I know. This is the ""Blue Badger."" They're trying to make him the police mascot."
Rise from the ashes,1,397,Ema,"Wow, Mr. Wright! You know a lot about the Police Department! Still, he does seem familiar, somehow..."
Rise from the ashes,1,398,Phoenix,Forget the Blue Badger! Who's that next to him!?
Rise from the ashes,1,399,Ema,Someone appears to be... dancing with the Blue Badger... Uh oh. He noticed me.
Rise from the ashes,1,400,Phoenix,He sure is running over here fast...
Rise from the ashes,1,401,Gumshoe,"H-h-h-hey, pal! W-w-w-what're you doin' here!?"
Rise from the ashes,1,402,Phoenix,"That's my line, Detective Gumshoe. Specifically, why were you dancing over there?"
Rise from the ashes,1,403,Gumshoe,"What!? Um, well..."
Rise from the ashes,1,404,Phoenix,"(Well, at least he doesn't seem to be busy. This is our chance to get information!)"
Rise from the ashes,1,405,Gumshoe,"Hey! I'll have you know I'm a very busy man, pal."
Rise from the ashes,1,406,Gumshoe,"I'll give you one word of advice, pal. You'd better not agree to defend the suspect in this case."
Rise from the ashes,1,407,Ema,Wh... Why not?
Rise from the ashes,1,408,Gumshoe,Huh? Well... It's just that the Chief Prosecutor has confessed to the crime. She says she summoned the detective to the Prosecutor's Office and... she killed him.
Rise from the ashes,1,409,Ema,"But, what if she's not telling the truth!?"
Rise from the ashes,1,410,Gumshoe,"Yes, well... no! C'mon, pal! There's plenty of evidence against her!"
Rise from the ashes,1,411,Ema,B-but what if the evidence was faked?
Rise from the ashes,1,412,Gumshoe,"Hey, pal. Can I speak to you for a second?"
Rise from the ashes,1,413,Phoenix,Huh? Me?
Rise from the ashes,1,414,Gumshoe,Why is this little girl so peeved at me?
Rise from the ashes,1,415,Phoenix,She's a relative of the suspect. Lana Skye's sister.
Rise from the ashes,1,416,Gumshoe,Whoa!!! The Chief Prosecutor's little sister!?
Rise from the ashes,1,417,Ema,"Just, please investigate this case carefully, okay? Scientifically!"
Rise from the ashes,1,418,Gumshoe,"Yessir! Oh, by the way. You might want to keep your voices down. You don't want to be overheard using words like ""faked""..."
Rise from the ashes,1,419,Ema,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,1,420,Gumshoe,It's just... it's a sensitive issue with us these days.
Rise from the ashes,1,421,Ema,"So... what are you doing here, Detective Gumshoe?"
Rise from the ashes,1,422,Gumshoe,"Me? Oh, well... nothing, really. They kicked me out of Criminal Affairs..."
Rise from the ashes,1,423,Phoenix,Detective Gumshoe! What did you do this time?
Rise from the ashes,1,424,Gumshoe,"Whaddya mean, ""this time""!?"
Rise from the ashes,1,425,Ema,"Then, what happened? I know things are busy right now... I mean... with my sister's case and all..."
Rise from the ashes,1,426,Gumshoe,It's true. We've never had a Chief Prosecutor murder anyone before! Only the highest-ranked people are being let into Criminal Affairs now... The lowest ranking guy in there is our chief of detectives. They're not letting any of us rank-and-file detectives in at all.
Rise from the ashes,1,427,Ema,None of you?
Rise from the ashes,1,428,Phoenix,"(I know this is an important trial, but isn't that a little odd?)"
Rise from the ashes,1,429,Gumshoe,"So, anyway, I thought I'd spend the day getting the badger dance down pat."
Rise from the ashes,1,430,Ema,Um... Isn't there anything else you could be doing?
Rise from the ashes,1,431,Gumshoe,"The Chief of Police himself is directing this investigation, pal. And Officer Marshall was assigned to the underground parking lot."
Rise from the ashes,1,432,Ema,Officer Marshall...
Rise from the ashes,1,433,Phoenix,"(Now that I think about it, Ema did seem to know that Marshall guy.)"
Rise from the ashes,1,434,Gumshoe,"A patrolman in charge of a crime scene... It's unheard of, pal!"
Rise from the ashes,1,435,Phoenix,"Um, Detective Gumshoe? What can you tell me about this?"
Rise from the ashes,1,436,Gumshoe,"Huh? Hey, pal! This is a detective's ID card! You can't just keep that! You have to turn it in to the police! It's people like you that get me into so much trouble all the time!"
Rise from the ashes,1,437,Phoenix,(Meaning Detective Gumshoe must drop his card a lot.)
Rise from the ashes,1,438,Gumshoe,"Hmm... let's see... ""Bruce Goodman""... Goodman... Sounds familiar... ... Nah, my mistake."
Rise from the ashes,1,439,Ema,"But, don't you work together with him in Criminal Affairs?"
Rise from the ashes,1,440,Gumshoe,Whoa!!! Now I remember! Bruce Goodman! He's the victim!
Rise from the ashes,1,441,Phoenix,(That's what I thought...)
Rise from the ashes,1,442,Ema,"Can you tell us more, Detective Gumshoe?"
Rise from the ashes,1,443,Phoenix,So... this ID card belonged to the victim?
Rise from the ashes,1,444,Gumshoe,"He was a detective, like myself. Detective Bruce Goodman."
Rise from the ashes,1,445,Ema,"Hmm... Don't you think it's strange? I mean, why would the victim's ID card be lying on the ground where we found it?"
Rise from the ashes,1,446,Gumshoe,"Well, Detective Goodman should have been at the Police Department yesterday. There was an evidence transferal for a case he handled two years ago."
Rise from the ashes,1,447,Ema,Evidence transferal... Mr. Edgeworth mentioned that too. But... Detective Goodman was killed at the Prosecutor's Office...
Rise from the ashes,1,448,Gumshoe,"Well, that's the thing... It's hard to say this, but... Word is that Chief Prosecutor Skye called him out there, to the parking lot."
Rise from the ashes,1,449,Phoenix,(And Lana's confessing as much...)
Rise from the ashes,1,450,Gumshoe,"Found in Mr. Edgeworth's car, stabbed with Mr. Edgeworth's knife, huh... What would drive Chief Prosecutor Skye to do such a thing?"
Rise from the ashes,1,451,Ema,...
Rise from the ashes,1,452,Gumshoe,"W-wait, I didn't mean... I mean, sure, of course someone else really did it! Someone who must have, um... Someone who must have a grudge against Mr. Edgeworth!"
Rise from the ashes,1,453,Phoenix,(The car and the knife do seem a little too well-organized to be a coincidence.)
Rise from the ashes,1,454,Ema,Poor Mr. Edgeworth... What could have happened?
Rise from the ashes,1,455,Phoenix,(We have to find out a little more about what's going on with Edgeworth...)
Rise from the ashes,1,456,Gumshoe,"He's in a tough spot, again..."
Rise from the ashes,1,457,Phoenix,"""Again""...?"
Rise from the ashes,1,458,Gumshoe,"Well, it all started with the murder of that defense attorney, Hammond."
Rise from the ashes,1,459,Ema,But Edgeworth was found innocent!
Rise from the ashes,1,460,Gumshoe,"Listen, pal, there have always been rumors about Edgeworth. Forging evidence, making deals with witnesses... Nothing outright, but there were always whispered rumors. Ever since he was accused of murder, no one's whispering. They're practically shouting!"
Rise from the ashes,1,461,Ema,But... but there's no evidence against him!
Rise from the ashes,1,462,Gumshoe,"Well, Mr. Edgeworth has always had unusually strong ties to the department higher-ups. It's only natural that people would be suspicious."
Rise from the ashes,1,463,Phoenix,(I had no idea he was under the gun...)
Rise from the ashes,1,464,Gumshoe,"Anyway, this latest case has started a new rumor. People say the only reason he took this case... is because he's aiming for the Chief Prosecutor position himself!"
Rise from the ashes,1,465,Phoenix,W-what!?
Rise from the ashes,1,466,Gumshoe,"But I know the truth, pal! Nobody wants to be the one who has to prosecute the chief prosecutor! Mr. Edgeworth is biting the bullet on this one! He's doing this for all of us!"
Rise from the ashes,1,467,Gumshoe,"... And that's all I know about that. I'm not officially on the case, you know."
Rise from the ashes,1,468,Ema,Thank you!
Rise from the ashes,1,469,Phoenix,"Why aren't you handling the case, Detective Gumshoe? We met the guy who is... what was his name? The guy in the parking lot..."
Rise from the ashes,1,470,Gumshoe,That'd be Officer Marshall. He was appointed directly by the Chief of Police...
Rise from the ashes,1,471,Phoenix,Officer Marshall... Is he some kind of Wild West sheriff or something?
Rise from the ashes,1,472,Gumshoe,"No, Jake Marshall's just a regular officer... From West LA."
Rise from the ashes,1,473,Phoenix,"For a moment there, I wasn't sure."
Rise from the ashes,1,474,Gumshoe,"Look, pal, let me try to make things a little easier for you. Show them this and they'll let you examine the crime scene... maybe."
Rise from the ashes,1,475,Phoenix,(I'll be surprised if this gets us anywhere...)
Rise from the ashes,1,476,Gumshoe,"Just act like you're supposed to be there, and nobody will look at you twice, pal!"
Rise from the ashes,1,477,Phoenix,(Looks like the investigation is still going...)
Rise from the ashes,1,478,Angel,I have to be getting back to the shop...
Rise from the ashes,1,479,Marshall,Sorry... Looks like I'll be stuck in this pit 'til the sun sleeps.
Rise from the ashes,1,480,Angel,"I'll see you in my dreams tonight, then, baby."
Rise from the ashes,1,481,Angel,Oh! Still here?
Rise from the ashes,1,482,Ema,"Ah, h-hello."
Rise from the ashes,1,483,Angel,"Why the surprised looks? Didn't I mention...? I've got a boyfriend in Criminal Affairs, too."
Rise from the ashes,1,484,Phoenix,(What happened to the security guard!?)
Rise from the ashes,1,485,Marshall,"Hey! What's wrong, bambina? You're lookin' like a dogie that's lost its herd!"
Rise from the ashes,1,486,Phoenix,(Jake Marshall... Strange guy to put in charge of a crime scene.)
Rise from the ashes,1,487,Ema,There's something I wanted to ask you!
Rise from the ashes,1,488,Marshall,The scene of the crime... a cold grave for men who've lost their dreams... And me? I watch over them as they sleep... dreaming of the desert's harsh judgment. ...
Rise from the ashes,1,489,Ema,He's asleep.
Rise from the ashes,1,490,Phoenix,Well... should we show this hopeless case something to catch his interest?
Rise from the ashes,1,491,Phoenix,Would you mind reading this for me?
Rise from the ashes,1,492,Marshall,"What's this? I warn you, fan letters to me go right in the spittoon!"
Rise from the ashes,1,493,Phoenix,It's a letter of introduction from Detective Gumshoe. May we investigate?
Rise from the ashes,1,494,Marshall,"Gumshoe...? Ah, that old cowdog? Hmm... He holding a birthday party or something?"
Rise from the ashes,1,495,Phoenix,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,1,496,Marshall,"Look, where it should say letter of ""introduction""... It says ""invitation."""
Rise from the ashes,1,497,Phoenix,"Ah... I think he just miswrote it. (Great, Detective Gumshoe. I owe you one...)"
Rise from the ashes,1,498,Marshall,"No worries. This proves it's from Detective Gumshoe, better than a blood test. Guess I'd better let you in, then."
Rise from the ashes,1,499,Ema,"Th-thank you, Officer Marshall!"
Rise from the ashes,1,500,Phoenix,"(Officer Marshall isn't a ""detective""... he's a ""patrolman""... That reminds me of something...)"
Rise from the ashes,1,501,Ema,That is odd! Isn't a crime scene supposed to be handled by a detective or higher?
Rise from the ashes,1,502,Marshall,"Well, folks. The clues are calling! Welcome to our gold strike. Be like the settler! Strike out for lands unknown! Manifest Destiny! Let's have a hootenanny!"
Rise from the ashes,1,503,Ema,"Note to self: police investigations are like settling land. Well, Mr. Wright, what do you say!?"
Rise from the ashes,1,504,Phoenix,(I say I won't be needing this anymore...)
Rise from the ashes,1,505,Phoenix,What's this? Looks like a note of some sort.
Rise from the ashes,1,506,Ema,Look! Something's written on it!
Rise from the ashes,1,507,Phoenix,"You're right. Let's see... ""6-7SÂ 12/2""..."
Rise from the ashes,1,508,Ema,"There's a name printed on the paper above that... ""Goodman."""
Rise from the ashes,1,509,Phoenix,(Maybe it fell out of his pocket when he was killed.)
Rise from the ashes,1,510,Ema,"Well? So? What does it mean, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,1,511,Phoenix,How am I supposed to know?
Rise from the ashes,1,512,Ema,"Note to self: for deductive reasoning, go to Edgeworth, not Wright."
Rise from the ashes,1,513,Phoenix,(I'm sure Edgeworth wouldn't know what this means either.)
Rise from the ashes,1,514,Phoenix,Officer Marshall? Could you tell us more about the victim?
Rise from the ashes,1,515,Marshall,"... Good men always die young. Remember that, pardner."
Rise from the ashes,1,516,Phoenix,Um... could you be a little more specific?
Rise from the ashes,1,517,Ema,"Bruce Goodman... He was a detective, right?"
Rise from the ashes,1,518,Marshall,"Well, well, aren't you a feisty dogie there now. Detective Goodman was stabbed here at 5:15... The smiling Madonna told me the tale..."
Rise from the ashes,1,519,Phoenix,"(I think he means the witness, Ms. Angel Starr.)"
Rise from the ashes,1,520,Marshall,One stab to the chest. A fine piece of work. This here's the autopsy report.
Rise from the ashes,1,521,Ema,Was my sister involved with the victim in any way?
Rise from the ashes,1,522,Marshall,"Funny you should mention that, bambina. Chief Prospector Skye and Detective Goodman... had nothing in common at all."
Rise from the ashes,1,523,Ema,Nothing in common...?
Rise from the ashes,1,524,Marshall,They apparently worked together on a case a few years back.
Rise from the ashes,1,525,Phoenix,(So... there's no motive!)
Rise from the ashes,1,526,Marshall,Goodman wasn't a particularly gifted detective. That's one reason why he didn't do much work with the Chief Prospector...
Rise from the ashes,1,527,Ema,"But, my sister called the victim here on the day of the murder, right? Here... to this parking lot?"
Rise from the ashes,1,528,Marshall,So it seems. Like calling an unarmed man to a shootout at high noon.
Rise from the ashes,1,529,Phoenix,"Um, I don't mean any offense, but... Officer Marshall, you're a patrolman, right? Not a detective."
Rise from the ashes,1,530,Marshall,You callin' me out? They shoot you for that in Texas.
Rise from the ashes,1,531,Phoenix,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,1,532,Marshall,"I was one of them fancy-shoed ""Detectives"" till two years ago, to tell ya the truth."
Rise from the ashes,1,533,Phoenix,"Oh, really? (Now he tells me!)"
Rise from the ashes,1,534,Ema,"But, you're a patrolman now. So how can you be in charge of a crime scene?"
Rise from the ashes,1,535,Marshall,"Nothing gets by you, does it, bambina?"
Rise from the ashes,1,536,Phoenix,"So, why are you in charge?"
Rise from the ashes,1,537,Marshall,No reason. We're just short on hands right now. I'm keeping an eye out in the meantime.
Rise from the ashes,1,538,Ema,"That's odd, though. Detective Gumshoe was saying he had nothing to do... nothing important, at least."
Rise from the ashes,1,539,Marshall,"He's nothing but a sad ol' cowdog, that can't find his tail. Maybe it's because he runs with that Edgeworth, eh?"
Rise from the ashes,1,540,Phoenix,Edgeworth...?
Rise from the ashes,1,541,Marshall,"That cowdog's been kicked out of this cattle run... by order of the Chief of Police. Just, he don't realize it yet."
Rise from the ashes,1,542,Phoenix,"(Detective Gumshoe, kicked out of the investigation!?)"
Rise from the ashes,1,543,Phoenix,That looks like a cell phone.
Rise from the ashes,1,544,Ema,Scientific analysis would suggest this belonged to the victim! I can't think of anyone else it could belong to...
Rise from the ashes,1,545,Phoenix,(What's so scientific about that!?) Should we check it out?
Rise from the ashes,1,546,Phoenix,(Right! Let's check it out.)
Rise from the ashes,1,547,Ema,Hmm. The display is still on the redial button.
Rise from the ashes,1,548,Phoenix,Redial...?
Rise from the ashes,1,549,Ema,"Um, Mr. Wright? Most phones keep a record of all the calls you've made and received. You just press the blue button to dial the last number you called. Convenient, isn't it? I'm surprised you didn't know about it."
Rise from the ashes,1,550,Phoenix,"Sorry to disappoint you, but even I know about things like ""redial."""
Rise from the ashes,1,551,Ema,"Huh? Oh, I'm sorry! It's just, you never know with people from your generation."
Rise from the ashes,1,552,Phoenix,(Whatever... Let's check this phone out.)
Rise from the ashes,1,553,Phoenix,"(Now, I wonder who the owner of this phone called last...)"
Rise from the ashes,1,554,Ema,"Note to self: a defense attorney doesn't think first, he just pushes the button."
Rise from the ashes,1,555,Cellular,*beep*
Rise from the ashes,1,556,Cellular,...
Rise from the ashes,1,557,Phoenix,Hey! That song! I know that!
Rise from the ashes,1,558,Marshall,Hey! What's going on over there?
Rise from the ashes,1,559,Cellular,*beep*
Rise from the ashes,1,560,Phoenix,"Ah! Oh, s-sorry."
Rise from the ashes,1,561,Marshall,"I see you, pardner! You pressed redial on that there phone, didn't you?"
Rise from the ashes,1,562,Phoenix,"Uh, well, yeah..."
Rise from the ashes,1,563,Ema,"Whose phone is this, anyway? It was on the ground over there..."
Rise from the ashes,1,564,Marshall,Whose is it? That belongs to Chief Prospector Skye.
Rise from the ashes,1,565,Ema,What? It's my sister's!?
Rise from the ashes,1,566,Marshall,"She apparently dropped it when she was taken into custody, right after the crime. Look... the last call was made right when the murder occurred! Looks like she was fixing to call someone. Except she only spoke for a few seconds, according to this."
Rise from the ashes,1,567,Phoenix,Who did she call!?
Rise from the ashes,1,568,Marshall,"No idea. Sorry, pardner. Now, I got a question for you, pardner. I heard a phone ring just now... one of those new- fangled ring-tunes."
Rise from the ashes,1,569,Phoenix,"Oh? That? Oh... I'm sorry, that was my phone."
Rise from the ashes,1,570,Marshall,W-w-what!? Your phone!?
Rise from the ashes,1,571,Phoenix,"Yeah, uh, it's kind of strange, but... Someone called me right as we picked up the other phone, a wrong number..."
Rise from the ashes,1,572,Marshall,"... I hope you're not lying... They shoot you for that in Texas, pardner!"
Rise from the ashes,1,573,Phoenix,"(Uh oh, I've incited the wrath of the Lone Star patrolman...)"
Rise from the ashes,1,574,Ema,So there's no connection between Detective Goodman and my sister!
Rise from the ashes,1,575,Marshall,"That's correct, but... There's a goldmine of evidence against her..."
Rise from the ashes,1,576,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,1,577,Marshall,"And the prospector tomorrow is none other than Edgeworth himself... I'm afraid your sister's fate is decided, bambina. Many condolences."
Rise from the ashes,1,578,Ema,Officer Marshall!
Rise from the ashes,1,579,Marshall,"Yeah, bambina?"
Rise from the ashes,1,580,Ema,"H-how can you say that! You and my sister, you were..."
Rise from the ashes,1,581,Phoenix,(Is there something between this cop and her sister that I don't know about?)
Rise from the ashes,1,582,Marshall,"...! I apologize, bambina. Something must have gotten to me. Maybe it's that dry wind that's a-blowin' through the Prospector's Office."
Rise from the ashes,1,583,Phoenix,"(Dry wind or ill will, someone's up to something here... but who?)"
Rise from the ashes,1,584,Marshall,Suspicions about Mr. Edgeworth have been flying around for nearly two years now.
Rise from the ashes,1,585,Phoenix,"Forged evidence... arranging testimonies, you name it."
Rise from the ashes,1,586,Marshall,"He was unbeatable because he did whatever it took to win. Unbeatable that is, until he met you."
Rise from the ashes,1,587,Ema,"But rumors are just... rumors, aren't they? These are prosecutors we're talking about! Evidence is everything to them!"
Rise from the ashes,1,588,Marshall,"If you follow the rumors about Edgeworth to their source, you find one person... But... they're off limits. Untouchable, you might say."
Rise from the ashes,1,589,Phoenix,One person? Who?
Rise from the ashes,1,590,Marshall,Bambina...It's your sister. Chief Prospector Lana Skye.
Rise from the ashes,1,591,Ema,What!? My sister...?
Rise from the ashes,1,592,Marshall,"Edgeworth couldn't rustle all those cattle by himself. Some people load their guns with bullets, some people load them with ""deals."""
Rise from the ashes,1,593,Phoenix,"What, you're saying Edgeworth was making deals to win trials?"
Rise from the ashes,1,594,Marshall,"""Where there's gunshots, there's bound to be bullets."" That's what the old-timers say. There's a big ol' secret hidden around here somewhere. Everyone knows it."
Rise from the ashes,1,595,Phoenix,(Is that why Detective Gumshoe was taken off the case...? Did they target him because he was closest to Edgeworth?)
Rise from the ashes,1,596,Ema,"So, well, how are we doing, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,1,597,Phoenix,"I guess we got some clues... We have an autopsy report, a note from the victim, and a cell phone..."
Rise from the ashes,1,598,Ema,So... you think we'll be okay?
Rise from the ashes,1,599,Phoenix,"Well, the only thing still bothering me is that Lana is confessing to the crime. She says she did it!"
Rise from the ashes,1,600,Ema,No problem! I can guarantee that she's not the criminal.
Rise from the ashes,1,601,Phoenix,"Oh by the way, Ema?"
Rise from the ashes,1,602,Ema,Yes?
Rise from the ashes,1,603,Phoenix,I know that song your phone plays when it rings...
Rise from the ashes,1,604,Ema,What...?
Rise from the ashes,1,605,Cellular,...
Rise from the ashes,1,606,Cellular,*beep*
Rise from the ashes,1,607,Phoenix,"It's the Steel Samurai theme song, isn't it? That popular TV show... for kids?"
Rise from the ashes,1,608,Ema,...!
Rise from the ashes,1,609,Phoenix,"The phone that just rang wasn't mine... it was yours. At 5:18, just after the murder took place... Your sister called you, didn't she, Ema?"
Rise from the ashes,1,610,Ema,I...I'm sorry!
Rise from the ashes,1,611,Phoenix,Can you tell me what you talked about?
Rise from the ashes,1,612,Ema,I... She hung up right away.
Rise from the ashes,1,613,Phoenix,I see...
Rise from the ashes,1,614,Phoenix,"(A detective is murdered, and the suspect is the top prosecutor in the district. I've got a bad feeling about this... Like... maybe I still don't know everything that went on here...)"
Rise from the ashes,2,0,Lana,"How did the investigation go yesterday, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,2,1,Phoenix,"Frankly, there are still a lot of... gray areas."
Rise from the ashes,2,2,Ema,"Or rather, the whole thing is one big gray area..."
Rise from the ashes,2,3,Lana,"Don't worry about me, no matter what the outcome. I'm ready to accept my fate."
Rise from the ashes,2,4,Ema,"I believe in you, sis."
Rise from the ashes,2,5,Lana,"Mr. Wright, let me offer you a word of advice."
Rise from the ashes,2,6,Phoenix,Yes?
Rise from the ashes,2,7,Lana,"A defense attorney should never ""believe"" their client."
Rise from the ashes,2,8,Ema,...!
Rise from the ashes,2,9,Lana,The defendant is called to trial because they are suspected of wrongdoing! Never forget that.
Rise from the ashes,2,10,Phoenix,"Ms. Skye, you... You remind me a lot of Mia. But there is one decisive difference between you and her."
Rise from the ashes,2,11,Lana,And that is?
Rise from the ashes,2,12,Phoenix,You're not a defense attorney.
Rise from the ashes,2,13,Lana,"... I believe it's almost time for the trial. Good luck, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,2,14,Phoenix,(My first trial without a Fey helping me... No one's going to bail me out this time... I'll be alone in there... So I have to discover the truth all by myself!)
Rise from the ashes,2,15,Ema,"Let's do it, Mr. Wright! I'll be with you the whole way!"
Rise from the ashes,2,16,Judge,The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye.
Rise from the ashes,2,17,Phoenix,"The defense is ready, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,2,18,Edgeworth,"The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,2,19,Phoenix,(Edgeworth... I haven't been in court since Edgeworth's trial... It's been a while now.)
Rise from the ashes,2,20,Edgeworth,"I hope that personal feelings will not be a part of the proceedings today, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,2,21,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,2,22,Edgeworth,"I will choose the path I think is right, regardless of what those around me might say. The judgment to be made here is in our hands, not those of anyone else."
Rise from the ashes,2,23,Judge,"Very well, Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement please."
Rise from the ashes,2,24,Edgeworth,"Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye has committed an unpardonable crime. Not only this, but she was rash enough to commit it in the Prosecutor's Office lot!"
Rise from the ashes,2,25,Ema,Wow... He's much more forceful in person. I suddenly feel like confessing to everything!
Rise from the ashes,2,26,Edgeworth,"However, she will now pay for her rashness with her life. There was a witness to her crime... A ""professional"" witness!"
Rise from the ashes,2,27,Judge,"Well then, call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth!"
Rise from the ashes,2,28,Edgeworth,"The prosecution calls its first witness, Ms. Angel Starr, to the stand."
Rise from the ashes,2,29,Phoenix,"(The ""Cough-up Queen""...?)"
Rise from the ashes,2,30,Judge,Hmm? Haven't I seen you somewhere...?
Rise from the ashes,2,31,Angel,"You ordered the Caviar Lunch, right?"
Rise from the ashes,2,32,Judge,Ho ho! Caviar! I've never eaten caviar before!
Rise from the ashes,2,33,Phoenix,(The judge is really wolfing it down...)
Rise from the ashes,2,34,Angel,"Ah, and for you... I have a Fiesta Bowl."
Rise from the ashes,2,35,Phoenix,Uh... thanks.
Rise from the ashes,2,36,Edgeworth,Will the witness state her name and profession?
Rise from the ashes,2,37,Angel,"Ah, and you, sir... Did you order ""The Fingerprint"" lunchbox?"
Rise from the ashes,2,38,Edgeworth,"It is too early for lunch. Your name and profession, please."
Rise from the ashes,2,39,Angel,"... Well, Your Honor? How does it taste?"
Rise from the ashes,2,40,Judge,So this is why everyone raves about caviar! It's so tasty it hurts! I always thought caviar would taste like pickled tapioca.
Rise from the ashes,2,41,Phoenix,(What the heck does pickled tapioca taste like!?)
Rise from the ashes,2,42,Edgeworth,Name. Profession. Now.
Rise from the ashes,2,43,Angel,"Me? The name is Angel Starr. Don't go forgetting it. I find myself running Lunchland these days. Is... that what you wanted me to say, Mr. Edgeworth?"
Rise from the ashes,2,44,Edgeworth,"Very well, witness. Please describe the incident to us."
Rise from the ashes,2,45,Judge,The prosecution will wait! I'm not finished eating...
Rise from the ashes,2,46,Phoenix,(Hurry it up!)
Rise from the ashes,2,47,Judge,"Mmmm... Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. As you know, we usually call on the police to provide a description of the crime..."
Rise from the ashes,2,48,Angel,"Your Honor, as Mr. Edgeworth has said to the court... I am a... ""professional."""
Rise from the ashes,2,49,Judge,Uh... Huh? What exactly does that mean?
Rise from the ashes,2,50,Edgeworth,"Until two years ago, Ms. Angel Starr was a special investigator with the police. She was a first-rate homicide detective."
Rise from the ashes,2,51,Ema,Wh-whaaaat!? Ms. Starr was a detective!?
Rise from the ashes,2,52,Judge,... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-hah! I-I know who you are!!! Cough-up...!?
Rise from the ashes,2,53,Angel,"Cough-up Queen Angel Starr, Your Honor. Long time no see."
Rise from the ashes,2,54,Judge,"V-v-very well! Y-you may continue with the description, Ms. Starr!"
Rise from the ashes,2,55,Phoenix,(Just who is this lady!?)
Rise from the ashes,2,56,Angel,If I might have the court's attention over here... The parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office is divided into two blocks. A Block is for the Prosecutor's Office personnel. B Block is for visitors and clients... A chain divider separates the two blocks.
Rise from the ashes,2,57,Judge,"I suppose that's to keep visitors from taking up prosecutor's spaces, yes."
Rise from the ashes,2,58,Angel,"The crime took place by a car in the back of A Block, in the car's trunk. The killer stabbed the victim with a knife and went to drive the body out. Unfortunately for her there was a witness, and an arrest was made on the spot."
Rise from the ashes,2,59,Judge,"And who was this valiant ""witness""...?"
Rise from the ashes,2,60,Angel,"Why, it was me, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,2,61,Judge,"Witness, did you see the very moment of the crime?"
Rise from the ashes,2,62,Angel,"Of course, Your Honor. Immediately after that, I apprehended the Chief Prosecutor."
Rise from the ashes,2,63,Judge,"Hmm... It seems rather cut and dry, doesn't it? Well, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,2,64,Phoenix,"Uh... I can't agree on principle, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,2,65,Angel,"It seems that some poor losers are unwilling to accept the truth, Your Honor. Shall I proceed to crush what little hope they have remaining?"
Rise from the ashes,2,66,Judge,"If you can... Then give them your worst, Ms. Starr!"
Rise from the ashes,2,67,Phoenix,"(Wait, are they talking about me...!?)"
Rise from the ashes,2,68,Judge,Hmm... Bringing a lunchbox to your boyfriend? How touching!
Rise from the ashes,2,69,Edgeworth,Hmph. As you can see... There is no room for doubt.
Rise from the ashes,2,70,Judge,"The key ""point"" of your testimony seems to be nothing other than... the point of the knife which you saw being stabbed into Detective Goodman!"
Rise from the ashes,2,71,Angel,So... how does it feel to be so utterly crushed?
Rise from the ashes,2,72,Phoenix,I... I'm still thinking about that.
Rise from the ashes,2,73,Ema,"I-it's merely a flesh wound, Mr. Wright!"
Rise from the ashes,2,74,Judge,"Very well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness."
Rise from the ashes,2,75,Angel,"Somehow, I always knew a day like this would come."
Rise from the ashes,2,76,Phoenix,How did you know!?
Rise from the ashes,2,77,Angel,I respect the prosecutors' basic abhorrence of crime. Yet their methods are ugly and twisted. Twisted methods will always lead to tragedy.
Rise from the ashes,2,78,Edgeworth,The lunchlady's uninformed opinion is duly noted.
Rise from the ashes,2,79,Angel,Given that they are used to erasing inconvenient evidence at their whim... Killing off a detective that knew too much is merely an extension of that.
Rise from the ashes,2,80,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,2,81,Ema,Ms. Starr... do you have something personal against prosecutors?
Rise from the ashes,2,82,Angel,"I felt that I had found my dream job when I became an investigator... And if I hadn't been laid off by those prosecutors over there, I'd still be one."
Rise from the ashes,2,83,Phoenix,Laid off...? (She was fired...)
Rise from the ashes,2,84,Angel,"To me, prosecutors are nothing more than worms. That said, I am a pro, as you know. My testimony is unbiased... and flawless."
Rise from the ashes,2,85,Judge,"Very well. You may continue, Ms. Starr."
Rise from the ashes,2,86,Angel,I was on my way to deliver a lunchbox to my boyfriend...
Rise from the ashes,2,87,Phoenix,This boyfriend... he's the detective?
Rise from the ashes,2,88,Angel,Not that boyfriend. The security guard.
Rise from the ashes,2,89,Judge,"Th-""that"" boyfriend? You have... several?"
Rise from the ashes,2,90,Angel,"Yes. ""This"" boyfriend, ""that"" boyfriend, and ""the other"" boyfriend. Care to join? The ""yet another"" boyfriend position is still open for applicants."
Rise from the ashes,2,91,Judge,"... I-I'll stick with the lunch, thanks."
Rise from the ashes,2,92,Ema,Note to self: the judge had to think before replying.
Rise from the ashes,2,93,Angel,"The security guard room is in the lot, in A Block. It's up on the second level so you can see everything from there."
Rise from the ashes,2,94,Phoenix,"(That would be the room with the ""SECURITY"" sign.) Incidentally, did you bring your lunchboxes by car?"
Rise from the ashes,2,95,Angel,"Since I'm a visitor now, I parked in B Block."
Rise from the ashes,2,96,Ema,So... she was in B Block when she witnessed the crime.
Rise from the ashes,2,97,Angel,When I sensed something... perhaps it was my finely-honed detective instincts working.
Rise from the ashes,2,98,Phoenix,"You ""sensed"" something? So, you're saying you had a premonition of the murder?"
Rise from the ashes,2,99,Angel,It felt like... how would you say... Oh yes... It was like the feeling you get when you view a pumpkin chock full of seeds!
Rise from the ashes,2,100,Judge,I have no idea what that means.
Rise from the ashes,2,101,Phoenix,"Speaking of a ""detective's instincts""... Wasn't the victim, Mr. Bruce Goodman, also a detective?"
Rise from the ashes,2,102,Angel,"Yes, well, he was like a young cheese."
Rise from the ashes,2,103,Judge,A... young cheese?
Rise from the ashes,2,104,Angel,"A pale white cheese, not yet tangy with experience on the streets. A greenhorn."
Rise from the ashes,2,105,Judge,"Hmm... I, of course, am hard, yellowed, sharp as a tack."
Rise from the ashes,2,106,Ema,"I bet you stink, too."
Rise from the ashes,2,107,Angel,"In any case, there, in the lot, I felt something stirring in the back of my mind..."
Rise from the ashes,2,108,Angel,"Then, through a wire fence, I saw the chief prosecutor standing next to a garish car."
Rise from the ashes,2,109,Phoenix,"By ""garish car,"" you mean..."
Rise from the ashes,2,110,Angel,"Mr. Edgeworth's car, yes."
Rise from the ashes,2,111,Judge,M-Mr. Edgeworth's!?
Rise from the ashes,2,112,Angel,"Incidentally, the knife with which the victim was stabbed was also Mr. Edgeworth's. Wasn't it?"
Rise from the ashes,2,113,Edgeworth,"... Indeed, it was."
Rise from the ashes,2,114,Judge,Hmm! What an odd case this is. And the person you saw... you are sure it was the defendant?
Rise from the ashes,2,115,Angel,I saw her from no further than thirty feet away. I am certain it was her.
Rise from the ashes,2,116,Phoenix,"(If she's telling the truth, we're doomed!)"
Rise from the ashes,2,117,Ema,"Let's just do what we can! Even if we don't have any proof, we can always complain!*"
Rise from the ashes,2,118,Phoenix,"Witness! In your testimony, you clearly stated the following: Prosecutors are nothing more than worms. Ergo! You are a biased witness!"
Rise from the ashes,2,119,Angel,"You might want to keep those silly opinions to YOURSELF in the future, rookie."
Rise from the ashes,2,120,Phoenix,Huh? Rookie?
Rise from the ashes,2,121,Angel,Unless you're willing to risk the consequences of doubting me? I'll fry you like a fritter! Crispy on the outside... chewy on the inside!!!
Rise from the ashes,2,122,Judge,That... That was inspiring!
Rise from the ashes,2,123,Ema,I believe I've heard that tag line elsewhere... you could cry plagiarism?
Rise from the ashes,2,124,Angel,I may be relegated to the lowly post of lunchlady... But my instincts are honed!
Rise from the ashes,2,125,Judge,A-a photograph! You took this!?
Rise from the ashes,2,126,Angel,"The moment I witnessed the crime, my reflexes took over and snap! I took a picture. In fact... One of my lunchboxes is rigged with a camera."
Rise from the ashes,2,127,Phoenix,(I suppose that's more exciting than just hanging it around your neck.)
Rise from the ashes,2,128,Edgeworth,Er... this is my first time seeing this photograph.
Rise from the ashes,2,129,Angel,"You think I'd show it to you, a prosecutor? Think again."
Rise from the ashes,2,130,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,2,131,Angel,My boyfriend works in the photography division of Criminal Affairs.
Rise from the ashes,2,132,Judge,Well... This is most certainly the defendant!
Rise from the ashes,2,133,Phoenix,"(Uh oh, that is unmistakably Lana Skye!)"
Rise from the ashes,2,134,Edgeworth,"So, what was the defendant doing at the time?"
Rise from the ashes,2,135,Angel,The chief prosecutor was holding a knife in her right hand....
Rise from the ashes,2,136,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,137,Phoenix,Tell me more about this knife that the suspect was carrying.
Rise from the ashes,2,138,Angel,"Well, I'd say the blade was about 10 centimeters long. Is that right, Mr. Edgeworth? It is your knife, after all."
Rise from the ashes,2,139,Edgeworth,"Er... Ahem, yes, that's about right."
Rise from the ashes,2,140,Angel,"Prosecutors are, by nature, well-versed in the location of a man's vital organs. I'm sure it was easier than boiling an egg for my egg salad surprise set."
Rise from the ashes,2,141,Phoenix,"Y-you can't testify as to her ability to kill an egg! I mean, a person!"
Rise from the ashes,2,142,Angel,Hmm? Perhaps a chicken salad set would have been a better metaphor?
Rise from the ashes,2,143,Edgeworth,"So, the defendant was holding a knife. What then?"
Rise from the ashes,2,144,Angel,"Then, she thrust the pointy tip of the knife into Detective Goodman's chest!"
Rise from the ashes,2,145,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,146,Phoenix,"Tell the court why you didn't try to stop this crime! You did see her raise the knife to strike, no?"
Rise from the ashes,2,147,Judge,Hmm... The defense has a point.
Rise from the ashes,2,148,Angel,"Unfortunately, by the time I realized what was going on, it was already too late."
Rise from the ashes,2,149,Phoenix,Too late...?
Rise from the ashes,2,150,Angel,Yes... the next moment... The chief prosecutor brought down the murder weapon!
Rise from the ashes,2,151,Phoenix,I... I see.
Rise from the ashes,2,152,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,153,Phoenix,And you witnessed this? You saw Ms. Skye stab the victim with the knife?
Rise from the ashes,2,154,Angel,"As I've already said, yes! I swear it on my finest ""Salmon Swirl"" lunch!"
Rise from the ashes,2,155,Judge,Hmm!!! I'm sure that is a fine lunch!
Rise from the ashes,2,156,Phoenix,"But... isn't that odd? Look at this photograph! This is the photograph you took of the very moment of the crime, is it not? Then why is Ms. Skye not holding a knife!?"
Rise from the ashes,2,157,Angel,...
Rise from the ashes,2,158,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,2,159,Judge,"... Ahem. Mr. Edgeworth, your thoughts?"
Rise from the ashes,2,160,Edgeworth,Objection.
Rise from the ashes,2,161,Phoenix,"Let's be a little more careful with our evidence, shall we?*"
Rise from the ashes,2,162,Edgeworth,"It is you that needs to be more careful, Mr. Wright!*"
Rise from the ashes,2,163,Judge,"What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?"
Rise from the ashes,2,164,Edgeworth,This photograph was not taken the moment before the stabbing... This was taken the moment AFTER the stabbing!
Rise from the ashes,2,165,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,166,Phoenix,H-how can you tell that!?
Rise from the ashes,2,167,Angel,Blood splatter.
Rise from the ashes,2,168,Phoenix,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,2,169,Angel,See the dark crimson stain on the Chief Prosecutor's coat?
Rise from the ashes,2,170,Phoenix,(It's a black-and-white photograph!)
Rise from the ashes,2,171,Judge,"Ah... yes, it's hard to tell, but this could be blood."
Rise from the ashes,2,172,Edgeworth,"Well, Mr. Wright? I see no problem here. No problem... except you."
Rise from the ashes,2,173,Ema,Mr. Wright! Are you going to just sit there and take that kind of abuse!?
Rise from the ashes,2,174,Phoenix,(Argh... You got a better idea?)
Rise from the ashes,2,175,Phoenix,"Wait! That contradicts what the witness said in her testimony! Namely, that she took the picture the ""moment"" she witnessed the crime!"
Rise from the ashes,2,176,Angel,"Well, it seems I was slightly unclear. My apologies."
Rise from the ashes,2,177,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,2,178,Angel,...
Rise from the ashes,2,179,Phoenix,Th-that's it!?
Rise from the ashes,2,180,Angel,"If you run out of lunch, you order seconds. Problem solved! If you don't like it, try ordering the jumbo sized lunch from the get-go!"
Rise from the ashes,2,181,Ema,"Good advice. I'm not sure I understood it, but... good advice."
Rise from the ashes,2,182,Angel,"I didn't have time to stop her. Prosecutor Skye was cold, calculating, like a robot. She killed without pain or remorse! It was a premeditated murder!"
Rise from the ashes,2,183,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,184,Phoenix,P-premeditated!? How do you know!?
Rise from the ashes,2,185,Edgeworth,Look at the chief prosecutor's hands in that photograph.
Rise from the ashes,2,186,Judge,Well...! Are those... gloves?
Rise from the ashes,2,187,Edgeworth,"Surgical gloves made of thin rubber, most likely. Why would she have those on?"
Rise from the ashes,2,188,Phoenix,Uh...
Rise from the ashes,2,189,Edgeworth,"If it was not premeditated, she would not be wearing those gloves!"
Rise from the ashes,2,190,Phoenix,Waaaaaargh!
Rise from the ashes,2,191,Judge,These gloves do seem to tell a tale of premeditation!
Rise from the ashes,2,192,Angel,Premeditated murder... a serious offense.
Rise from the ashes,2,193,Judge,Witness! Add this to your testimony!
Rise from the ashes,2,194,Angel,The murder was planned! The rubber gloves prove it!
Rise from the ashes,2,195,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,196,Phoenix,"What if she was just in the habit of wearing gloves? Like, driving gloves?"
Rise from the ashes,2,197,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,198,Edgeworth,"The gloves were admitted as evidence when the defendant was arrested! They were rubber gloves, of the kind used for autopsies!"
Rise from the ashes,2,199,Angel,"In other words, when the chief prosecutor came to the crime scene... She came to do murder! It's the only possible conclusion one can make. Everything was planned, it was a premeditated crime!"
Rise from the ashes,2,200,Phoenix,Arrrrgh!
Rise from the ashes,2,201,Judge,"Impressive! I'm sorry they took you off the force, Ms. Starr!"
Rise from the ashes,2,202,Phoenix,"(This is bad... She's got them thinking this was all planned... If she can prove this claim, the trial's already over! I've got to think of a way to show that this wasn't premeditated!)"
Rise from the ashes,2,203,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,204,Phoenix,"Witness, do you know what this is?"
Rise from the ashes,2,205,Angel,"Are you trying to test me? I sell box lunches for a living, you know. That's a knife. THE knife. The knife that was in Mr. Edgeworth's trunk!"
Rise from the ashes,2,206,Edgeworth,"Indeed, it is my knife."
Rise from the ashes,2,207,Phoenix,The defense has a request. We ask that the witness provide an ACCURATE testimony.
Rise from the ashes,2,208,Angel,"What's that, Rookie?"
Rise from the ashes,2,209,Phoenix,In your testimony... You stated that Lana Skye planned this murder. And that's why she was wearing those special gloves.
Rise from the ashes,2,210,Judge,Seems like a natural conclusion to me! The gloves do indicate planning...
Rise from the ashes,2,211,Phoenix,However! Why would she not also prepare the most important thing... the murder weapon!?
Rise from the ashes,2,212,Angel,Oh.
Rise from the ashes,2,213,Phoenix,"This knife just happened to be in the trunk of that car. Ladies and gentlemen, if you're going to plan a murder, you don't forget the weapon!"
Rise from the ashes,2,214,Angel,Ugh... Woooooooorrrgh!
Rise from the ashes,2,215,Judge,Order! Order! Order!
Rise from the ashes,2,216,Phoenix,(Great! Now the tide is turning in our favor!)
Rise from the ashes,2,217,Ema,"Great show, Mr. Wright! My sister's as good as free!"
Rise from the ashes,2,218,Edgeworth,Wright. I believe the next lunch you'll be eating is... humble pie!
Rise from the ashes,2,219,Phoenix,W-what!?
Rise from the ashes,2,220,Edgeworth,"I hope you weren't deluding yourself into thinking that the ""tide has turned."" Not over such a trifling detail!"
Rise from the ashes,2,221,Phoenix,B-but this shoots a hole in the whole premeditated theory!
Rise from the ashes,2,222,Edgeworth,Bah! The prosecution could care less if it was premeditated or not. The only one who seems to care is that lunchlady over there.
Rise from the ashes,2,223,Angel,!
Rise from the ashes,2,224,Edgeworth,"The defendant, Lana Skye, murdered a detective with a knife. That is the only thing the prosecution need prove. Nothing else."
Rise from the ashes,2,225,Angel,"Very good, Mr. Prosecutor... I suppose you think you're clever now? But you know as well as I do that she planned on killing him! It was planned! If it wasn't, why would she have been wearing..."
Rise from the ashes,2,226,Judge,I believe I'd like to hear your testimony again.
Rise from the ashes,2,227,Edgeworth,"Witness, please tell us only what you ""saw,"" not what you ""thought."""
Rise from the ashes,2,228,Angel,How dare you! My powers of deduction are not to be underestimated!
Rise from the ashes,2,229,Phoenix,(Really now...)
Rise from the ashes,2,230,Judge,"The victim was summoned from the Police Department to the Prosecutor's Office.. It does sound a lot like premeditation, doesn't it!?"
Rise from the ashes,2,231,Ema,"So, if I order pizza, does that mean I'm planning to kill the delivery boy?"
Rise from the ashes,2,232,Judge,"In any case, the defense may now cross-examine the witness."
Rise from the ashes,2,233,Angel,Lana Skye intended to murder Detective Goodman!
Rise from the ashes,2,234,Phoenix,"You've said that, but you haven't told us how you know!"
Rise from the ashes,2,235,Angel,"That's what I'm about to tell you, Rookie!"
Rise from the ashes,2,236,Judge,I believe what she just said was a mere prelude to the story she is about to tell. Try not to interrupt her again.
Rise from the ashes,2,237,Angel,Rookie... Never interrupt a storyteller! It's like pulling a bun out of the oven half-baked!
Rise from the ashes,2,238,Phoenix,"(Something's half-baked here alright, and it's you!)"
Rise from the ashes,2,239,Edgeworth,"Try not to confuse the defense, witness. They're not very quick on their feet. Now, why did you believe the suspect had intentions to murder the victim?"
Rise from the ashes,2,240,Angel,Her actions speak for themselves!
Rise from the ashes,2,241,Angel,That's why she called the victim all the way to the Prosecutor's Office.
Rise from the ashes,2,242,Phoenix,You have no proof that Ms. Skye called him there!
Rise from the ashes,2,243,Angel,You have no proof that she didn't!
Rise from the ashes,2,244,Judge,"Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth, thoughts?"
Rise from the ashes,2,245,Edgeworth,"There is no record of a call made on the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye's phone."
Rise from the ashes,2,246,Angel,She might have written him a letter!
Rise from the ashes,2,247,Phoenix,"(C'mon! You could have tried ""public phone"" first, at least!)"
Rise from the ashes,2,248,Edgeworth,"In any case, the victim came to the Prosecutor's Office, where he was murdered."
Rise from the ashes,2,249,Judge,I'm sure he had a reason to be there. Witness? Why do you think it was the suspect who summoned the victim that day?
Rise from the ashes,2,250,Angel,I'm sure the Chief Prosecutor had a grudge against the victim.
Rise from the ashes,2,251,Phoenix,"What kind of ""grudge""!?"
Rise from the ashes,2,252,Angel,"Well, I wouldn't know that."
Rise from the ashes,2,253,Phoenix,Of course you don't! That's because she didn't have a grudge!
Rise from the ashes,2,254,Angel,Rookie... I have a lunchbox here. Now... what's inside?
Rise from the ashes,2,255,Phoenix,H-how am I supposed to know!?
Rise from the ashes,2,256,Angel,"See? We agree there is a lunchbox here, but we don't know what's inside! A person's life is like a lunchbox with pretzels. Don't you agree?"
Rise from the ashes,2,257,Judge,I-I get it! That's why my lunch was so salty!
Rise from the ashes,2,258,Phoenix,(This judge isn't very good with metaphors...)
Rise from the ashes,2,259,Edgeworth,The suspect had a grudge against Detective Goodman. Will you tell us your basis for thinking this?
Rise from the ashes,2,260,Angel,It's simple...
Rise from the ashes,2,261,Angel,Nothing else could drive that human machine to plunge the knife in again and again...
Rise from the ashes,2,262,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,263,Phoenix,"A ""human machine""!? That's a contradiction!"
Rise from the ashes,2,264,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,265,Edgeworth,"Please... Can't you find fault with something of substance, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,2,266,Ema,Note to self: Mr. Edgeworth's sighs smell like citrus fruit.
Rise from the ashes,2,267,Phoenix,"Umm... You say ""again and again""... how many times did she stab him, exactly?"
Rise from the ashes,2,268,Angel,"We often say ""chop into a thousand pieces,"" but we don't actually mean 1,000 pieces. What difference does it make if the deed is done!?"
Rise from the ashes,2,269,Phoenix,(How come she's getting mad at me!?)
Rise from the ashes,2,270,Judge,Let's just say she stabbed him several times and leave it at that.
Rise from the ashes,2,271,Phoenix,"(Leave it at that!? This is a murder case, people!)"
Rise from the ashes,2,272,Ema,"Mr. Wright, you should speak up if you have an objection, you know!"
Rise from the ashes,2,273,Angel,Her red muffler looked like blood to me... that's how ghastly the whole scene was.
Rise from the ashes,2,274,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,275,Phoenix,Her red muffler?
Rise from the ashes,2,276,Angel,"Yes, like a scarf. The Chief Prosecutor always wears one around her neck. So she can be easily hanged at a moment's notice, I suppose..."
Rise from the ashes,2,277,Phoenix,(She's right... Ms. Skye was wearing a red scarf... wasn't she?) But wait... Isn't it odd that you mistook that for splattered blood?
Rise from the ashes,2,278,Angel,...
Rise from the ashes,2,279,Judge,"Well, people often mistake my beard... For a bib."
Rise from the ashes,2,280,Phoenix,(A judge with a bib. That's why this place feels so much like kindergarten sometimes.)
Rise from the ashes,2,281,Angel,Actually... I do think I saw some traces of blood on her chest...
Rise from the ashes,2,282,Edgeworth,"However, the autopsy report is clear on this matter. There was only one knife wound."
Rise from the ashes,2,283,Angel,...
Rise from the ashes,2,284,Phoenix,"(Apparently, Ms. Starr isn't entirely sure of her own testimony.)"
Rise from the ashes,2,285,Ema,Mr. Wright! This is our chance!!!
Rise from the ashes,2,286,Phoenix,"Chance for what, I wonder...?"
Rise from the ashes,2,287,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,288,Phoenix,Ms. Starr! I demand an explanation...
Rise from the ashes,2,289,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,290,Edgeworth,The witness is clearly not suited for detective work.
Rise from the ashes,2,291,Angel,W-what!?
Rise from the ashes,2,292,Edgeworth,The suspect was not wearing a scarf or muffler of any kind when she stabbed the victim. And you've proved it yourself! With this photograph!
Rise from the ashes,2,293,Angel,Huh? B-but that... That can't be!
Rise from the ashes,2,294,Edgeworth,"Only a true professional could be so clueless. I'm sure you'll make a good lunchlady, have no fear."
Rise from the ashes,2,295,Judge,Hmm! Harsh words! But good!
Rise from the ashes,2,296,Ema,"In the end, Mr. Edgeworth prevails!"
Rise from the ashes,2,297,Phoenix,"(What was my objection, chopped liver!?)"
Rise from the ashes,2,298,Angel,"B-but it was there, a scarf, no, not that, but something red! Really!"
Rise from the ashes,2,299,Edgeworth,"Well now, where were we? The witness has given us an entertaining interlude, now back to business."
Rise from the ashes,2,300,Angel,Wh-what!?
Rise from the ashes,2,301,Judge,"Very well, witness, continue your testimony. You saw the crime, and apprehended the suspect... Tell us about that."
Rise from the ashes,2,302,Angel,"...... Very well. I do remember some things accurately, at least."
Rise from the ashes,2,303,Phoenix,"(Ultimately, we couldn't shake the most important part of her testimony.)"
Rise from the ashes,2,304,Ema,The most important part...?
Rise from the ashes,2,305,Phoenix,The part where your sister stabs the victim! (This next testimony might just be the moment of truth!)
Rise from the ashes,2,306,Judge,"You are quite determined about this scarf, aren't you?"
Rise from the ashes,2,307,Angel,I strike like a snake and bite like a cobra! That's me. Angel Starr.
Rise from the ashes,2,308,Phoenix,"That wasn't a very good metaphor. First of all, a cobra is a kind of snake."
Rise from the ashes,2,309,Angel,"Don't bother me with details, unless you want to get bitten!"
Rise from the ashes,2,310,Phoenix,N-no thanks!
Rise from the ashes,2,311,Ema,Note to self: Attorney Wright gets bitten by snake.
Rise from the ashes,2,312,Angel,"The chief prosecutor tried to resist, but her efforts were in vain. She knocked my hands aside, kicked over an oil drum..."
Rise from the ashes,2,313,Phoenix,O-oil drum? (Hard to imagine...)
Rise from the ashes,2,314,Angel,"Oh, she's beautiful, but deadly! A predator, this one! A leopard woman! Rowr!"
Rise from the ashes,2,315,Judge,"Very well, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you will."
Rise from the ashes,2,316,Angel,"After the murder, the suspect attempted to run behind a partition off to her side."
Rise from the ashes,2,317,Phoenix,"So where is this ""partition"" on the floor plans?"
Rise from the ashes,2,318,Edgeworth,I'm sure she means this wall next to the car.
Rise from the ashes,2,319,Phoenix,(That's right... There was a wall there... about 6 feet high.)
Rise from the ashes,2,320,Angel,She was obviously trying to hide herself. Quite a natural thing for a criminal to do!
Rise from the ashes,2,321,Edgeworth,And what did you do then?
Rise from the ashes,2,322,Angel,"I quickly caught her, explained her rights to her, and arrested her on the spot."
Rise from the ashes,2,323,Phoenix,"You say ""quickly""... were you close to the suspect?"
Rise from the ashes,2,324,Angel,As I just said! I was only 30 feet away from her the whole time.
Rise from the ashes,2,325,Phoenix,(Hmm... maybe I should press her for more details?)
Rise from the ashes,2,326,Phoenix,"I'd like to see this on the floor plans, just to be safe. The Lunchland car was..."
Rise from the ashes,2,327,Edgeworth,"She was a ""visitor,"" thus, she was parked in B Block."
Rise from the ashes,2,328,Phoenix,"So, you witnessed the murder from... here?"
Rise from the ashes,2,329,Judge,"That would make it about 30 feet from the car, yes."
Rise from the ashes,2,330,Phoenix,"Is that correct, Ms. Starr?"
Rise from the ashes,2,331,Angel,"Y-yes, that's right."
Rise from the ashes,2,332,Judge,"But, there was a chain link fence in front of you...?"
Rise from the ashes,2,333,Angel,"I went over it, of course."
Rise from the ashes,2,334,Judge,"Amazing! The Cough-up Queen, lunchlady athlete, indeed."
Rise from the ashes,2,335,Ema,It would have taken her a little time to climb over the fence. So she couldn't have gotten to my sister THAT fast...
Rise from the ashes,2,336,Phoenix,"(Yeah, that fence was about nine feet high, too. How come Ms. Skye didn't get away?)"
Rise from the ashes,2,337,Angel,"Ah, yes. When I arrested her, she mentioned the muffler!"
Rise from the ashes,2,338,Phoenix,She mentioned the muffler? What exactly did she say?
Rise from the ashes,2,339,Angel,If I remembered exactly I would have told you in my testimony!
Rise from the ashes,2,340,Phoenix,(Cheeky!)
Rise from the ashes,2,341,Angel,"Anyway, all I heard her say was the word ""muffler."""
Rise from the ashes,2,342,Judge,Just that one word?
Rise from the ashes,2,343,Edgeworth,"So... what you heard wasn't the suspect talking to you, but to someone else?"
Rise from the ashes,2,344,Angel,Yes. The chief prospector was talking on her phone!
Rise from the ashes,2,345,Phoenix,(Her phone? You mean... this cell phone?)
Rise from the ashes,2,346,Phoenix,"By phone... do you mean this cell phone, discovered at the crime scene?"
Rise from the ashes,2,347,Angel,"Yes, ultimately."
Rise from the ashes,2,348,Edgeworth,Ultimately?
Rise from the ashes,2,349,Angel,"My memory... it's like a salmon, heading upstream, you see."
Rise from the ashes,2,350,Judge,"N-no, the court doesn't see, Ms. Starr."
Rise from the ashes,2,351,Angel,The chief prosecutor first attempted to use the phone hanging on the wall.
Rise from the ashes,2,352,Judge,On the wall?
Rise from the ashes,2,353,Phoenix,(That's right! Near the car... there was an emergency phone on the wall!)
Rise from the ashes,2,354,Angel,"Apparently, it was out of order."
Rise from the ashes,2,355,Judge,And so she used her cell phone?
Rise from the ashes,2,356,Edgeworth,"Indeed, the emergency phone was out of order that day."
Rise from the ashes,2,357,Judge,"Hmm. Good witnessing, witness!"
Rise from the ashes,2,358,Phoenix,(Good witnessing? What ever happened to good testifying?)
Rise from the ashes,2,359,Judge,You should of course add this to your testimony.
Rise from the ashes,2,360,Angel,The things I do to please this rookie defense attorney.
Rise from the ashes,2,361,Angel,She gave up trying to use the phone on the wall and just used her cell phone!
Rise from the ashes,2,362,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,363,Phoenix,Um... do you think you could restate your testimony for the court?
Rise from the ashes,2,364,Judge,Ah hah! I was going to ask the same thing!
Rise from the ashes,2,365,Angel,"I'll only say this one time, so listen close, Rookies. The chief prosecutor stabbed the victim, and ran behind the partition. Then she picked up the emergency phone on the wall, but it was out of order. So she pulled her own cell phone out of her pocket."
Rise from the ashes,2,366,Judge,"And during that time, you climbed over the chain link fence..."
Rise from the ashes,2,367,Angel,"Then, when I boldly grabbed her arm... The chief prosecutor hung up her phone!"
Rise from the ashes,2,368,Phoenix,And you saw her doing this?
Rise from the ashes,2,369,Ema,"...? What is it, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,2,370,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,371,Phoenix,I have to conclude that you have a personal grudge against Ms. Lana Skye.
Rise from the ashes,2,372,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,373,Edgeworth,The witness is a former detective. Her testimony is unmarred by personal bias.
Rise from the ashes,2,374,Angel,"Well, who would have thought you would be my knight in shining armor, prosecutor? You who, together with the chief prosecutor, kicked me out two years ago!"
Rise from the ashes,2,375,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,2,376,Phoenix,"Well, Ms. Starr... This is a fatal contradiction with your testimony... How do you explain this?"
Rise from the ashes,2,377,Angel,Hmph! I don't know what you're talking about. Mess with me... and I'll make you cough it ALL up!
Rise from the ashes,2,378,Phoenix,"Ahem. Let's look at the floor plans. You said you witnessed the crime from this point. However, if that's true... You couldn't possibly have seen Ms. Skye making that phone call!"
Rise from the ashes,2,379,Angel,...!
Rise from the ashes,2,380,Phoenix,"I believe you see what I'm getting at. That emergency phone was on the back side of this partition. If, indeed, you were in B Block... You couldn't have seen it!"
Rise from the ashes,2,381,Angel,Wha... Waaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!
Rise from the ashes,2,382,Judge,Order! Order! What is the meaning of this?
Rise from the ashes,2,383,Phoenix,"It's simple, Your Honor. She's not coughing up lunch...  she's coughing up lies!!!"
Rise from the ashes,2,384,Angel,Grrr!
Rise from the ashes,2,385,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,386,Edgeworth,"That's quite a claim, Mr. Wright... perhaps you will allow me a question? Tell us exactly what lie this witness has told the court!"
Rise from the ashes,2,387,Phoenix,(Here's where the counterattack begins! I can't afford to get this wrong!) The witness lied about...
Rise from the ashes,2,388,Phoenix,She tried to use the emergency phone... but it was out of order. What is significant about this fact? Nothing. It would be pointless for her to lie about it!
Rise from the ashes,2,389,Judge,Pointless to lie... I see!
Rise from the ashes,2,390,Phoenix,The witness did actually see Ms. Skye using the emergency phone. In other words... Ms. Starr witnessed the crime from a different location!
Rise from the ashes,2,391,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,392,Edgeworth,A different location!? Now that's a pointless lie if I ever heard one!
Rise from the ashes,2,393,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,394,Phoenix,Before you call my lie pointless... at least let me tell it!
Rise from the ashes,2,395,Judge,"Let me ask a question to our clever wordsmith, Mr. Wright. Just where was the witness when she saw the crime!?"
Rise from the ashes,2,396,Phoenix,(All the testimony we've heard until now points in one direction...) The place from where Ms. Starr witnessed this crime was... here!
Rise from the ashes,2,397,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,398,Phoenix,This is the only place where she could have been.
Rise from the ashes,2,399,Judge,The security guard room?
Rise from the ashes,2,400,Edgeworth,"Indeed, the security room in the underground parking lot is well positioned... It's built on the second level, so you can see the entire lot."
Rise from the ashes,2,401,Judge,Hmm... She would have been able to see the emergency phone from there. But why there? There are many other places where she could have seen the phone.
Rise from the ashes,2,402,Phoenix,"Not in this case, Your Honor. The witness, not being part of the Prosecutor's Office, couldn't park in A Block. The only place where she could have seen the crime and the back of the partition is here. I remember in your testimony, you said... You brought a lunch to your ""boyfriend"" in the security guard room, yes? Well, Ms. Starr?"
Rise from the ashes,2,403,Angel,"... How many years have I been getting the better of men...? To think that the tables could be turned... Today, a man has got the better of Angel Starr!"
Rise from the ashes,2,404,Judge,Order! Order! Witness! What have you done!? You used to be a detective! You should know better!
Rise from the ashes,2,405,Angel,I'm not turning back. The guilty will be punished. And I'll do what I must to make sure justice prevails.
Rise from the ashes,2,406,Phoenix,(The guilty... is she talking about Ms. Skye...?)
Rise from the ashes,2,407,Ema,"Um, Mr. Wright? Doesn't this strike you as odd? Why did Ms. Starr lie? It doesn't make sense!"
Rise from the ashes,2,408,Phoenix,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,2,409,Ema,She could have just said she saw the crime from the security guard station. It wouldn't change anything!
Rise from the ashes,2,410,Edgeworth,Exactly! This photograph tells all! It was the defendant who stabbed the victim! That truth still stands!
Rise from the ashes,2,411,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,412,Phoenix,"It ""still stands""? I disagree, Mr. Edgeworth."
Rise from the ashes,2,413,Edgeworth,Wh-what!?
Rise from the ashes,2,414,Phoenix,"If a witness is found to be lying, they're guilty of perjury. She knows this. She wouldn't risk that without a good reason!"
Rise from the ashes,2,415,Judge,"So, tell us what her reason was, Mr. Wright!"
Rise from the ashes,2,416,Phoenix,... Huh? M-me?
Rise from the ashes,2,417,Judge,Who else!?
Rise from the ashes,2,418,Ema,Mr. Wright! Let's review what we know!
Rise from the ashes,2,419,Phoenix,(Ms. Starr witnessed the crime from the security guard station... But she lied and said she saw it from B Block... It must make a vital difference... but what? What would change...?)
Rise from the ashes,2,420,Phoenix,It changes the distance between her and the scene of the crime!
Rise from the ashes,2,421,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,422,Edgeworth,"My condolences, Mr. Wright... But one look at the floor plans and it's quite clear. The distance between the scene of the crime and the guard station is 30 feet. I don't see how that would change what she could see."
Rise from the ashes,2,423,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,424,Phoenix,What she saw is not in question here. What matters is the time it would take her to reach the scene of the crime!
Rise from the ashes,2,425,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,2,426,Phoenix,"Ms. Starr! You witnessed the crime from the security guard station! Now, how long did it take you to go from there... to the scene of the crime, where you arrested Ms. Skye!?"
Rise from the ashes,2,427,Angel,...
Rise from the ashes,2,428,Judge,"Well, witness?"
Rise from the ashes,2,429,Angel,You...
Rise from the ashes,2,430,Phoenix,Y-yes...?
Rise from the ashes,2,431,Angel,"You ordered the Squid Wheels, right?"
Rise from the ashes,2,432,Phoenix,(The quality of my lunches has gone from low to inedible.)
Rise from the ashes,2,433,Angel,I was bringing a PB&J lunch with fresh boysenberry jam to my boyfriend.
Rise from the ashes,2,434,Judge,Hmm... Boysenberry for the boyfriend!
Rise from the ashes,2,435,Angel,"He wasn't in the station, so I waited. I witnessed the crime from the glass-walled station... and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself running towards the scene. But... the door was locked. I couldn't open it. That's why I had to go through the visitor's parking in B Block."
Rise from the ashes,2,436,Judge,That's quite a detour.
Rise from the ashes,2,437,Angel,It probably took me at least five minutes to get to the scene of the crime.
Rise from the ashes,2,438,Judge,F-f-f-five minutes!? Hmm... This changes things considerably!
Rise from the ashes,2,439,Angel,"But, it was that woman over there in the defendant's chair who stabbed him! I know it! I have photographic evidence! I swear it... I swear it on my finest plastic spork!"
Rise from the ashes,2,440,Judge,You have a point. And the spork is a wonderful invention.
Rise from the ashes,2,441,Angel,Would you like another Caviar Lunch...?
Rise from the ashes,2,442,Judge,Absolutely!
Rise from the ashes,2,443,Phoenix,(Uh oh...)
Rise from the ashes,2,444,Ema,Mr. Wright! You have to do something!
Rise from the ashes,2,445,Phoenix,(Do I have any evidence to stop this...?)
Rise from the ashes,2,446,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,447,Phoenix,Five minutes between the witnessing of the murder and the arrest! Think about it! You could make pasta in that amount of time! If you like it al dente!
Rise from the ashes,2,448,Angel,"I've got lunchboxes that tie pasta into knots, Rookie!"
Rise from the ashes,2,449,Phoenix,"A five minute ""blank""... Isn't that strange!?"
Rise from the ashes,2,450,Edgeworth,Strange...?
Rise from the ashes,2,451,Phoenix,"If you were a criminal... What would you do with five minutes, Your Honor?"
Rise from the ashes,2,452,Judge,"Well, um... I guess I'd flee the scene. Hey! D-don't get the wrong idea! I didn't kill anyone..."
Rise from the ashes,2,453,Phoenix,But you have the instincts of a killer! You would run! But this time was different! Ms. Skye dawdled at the scene of the crime... she even had her picture taken! No true criminal would act this way! It's inconceivable!
Rise from the ashes,2,454,Angel,Y- yeeeaaargh!
Rise from the ashes,2,455,Judge,"Well then. It seems we've come to the end of this testimony. She has a grudge against the defendant, and there is a blank in her testimony."
Rise from the ashes,2,456,Angel,...!
Rise from the ashes,2,457,Judge,"Mr. Edgeworth, is the next witness ready to go?"
Rise from the ashes,2,458,Edgeworth,Unfortunately... I appear to have overestimated this witness on account of her professional history...
Rise from the ashes,2,459,Ema,"We did it! We screwed that can shut, Mr. Wright!"
Rise from the ashes,2,460,Phoenix,(Th-that was too close!)
Rise from the ashes,2,461,Judge,"I'm afraid that the Cough-up Queen has been dethroned. And with that, court is adjourned!"
Rise from the ashes,2,462,Angel,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,463,Angel,"Mr. Edgeworth, you ordered the Squid Wheels, right?"
Rise from the ashes,2,464,Phoenix,(That's the one she tried to foist off on me!)
Rise from the ashes,2,465,Edgeworth,I prefer to not take the defense team's leftovers. Anything else to say?
Rise from the ashes,2,466,Angel,I... might be able to save you. I have decisive evidence.
Rise from the ashes,2,467,Judge,Wh-what was that!?
Rise from the ashes,2,468,Phoenix,(Is this another one of her trick lunchboxes!?)
Rise from the ashes,2,469,Judge,"My apologies, but we have no further questions to ask of you, Ms. Starr."
Rise from the ashes,2,470,Angel,Ah... Is this your jumbo lunchbox?
Rise from the ashes,2,471,Judge,"Whoo hoo! A triple-decker! Out of deference to the witness's determination, I'll allow one more testimony! Let's hear about this decisive evidence."
Rise from the ashes,2,472,Angel,"Like the Lunchland motto says, you won't be disappointed!"
Rise from the ashes,2,473,Phoenix,(What's she going to pull out of her lunchbox this time!?)
Rise from the ashes,2,474,Judge,Wh-what!? There was blood found on that shoe!?
Rise from the ashes,2,475,Angel,"Try Lunchland, for all your lunch and decisive evidence needs!"
Rise from the ashes,2,476,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,477,Edgeworth,"Witness, what's the meaning of this? Why is this the first time I've heard of this evidence?"
Rise from the ashes,2,478,Angel,"Simple. As I've already said... I don't trust you with evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! That's why I took the liberty of investigating this myself."
Rise from the ashes,2,479,Edgeworth,And... you had blood tests performed?
Rise from the ashes,2,480,Angel,Didn't I mention? I have three boyfriends in forensics.
Rise from the ashes,2,481,Edgeworth,"In any case, Your Honor, I can't accept this as evidence!"
Rise from the ashes,2,482,Angel,What...?
Rise from the ashes,2,483,Edgeworth,"You should know the two rules of evidence law, Ms. Starr! Rule 1: no evidence shall be shown without the approval of the Police Department! In other words, this shoe is illegal evidence! At least, for the time being!"
Rise from the ashes,2,484,Ema,"I-is that right, Mr. Wright!?"
Rise from the ashes,2,485,Phoenix,It seems so. Edgeworth sure is celebrating.
Rise from the ashes,2,486,Angel,"Not so fast, Mr. Edgeworth."
Rise from the ashes,2,487,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,2,488,Angel,"Don't forget... I used to be a detective! As I mentioned previously... This shoe has already been tested by a member of the forensics department! As you can see, it was approved by the Police Department as of... today. Even the general public can produce official evidence, Mr. Edgeworth."
Rise from the ashes,2,489,Edgeworth,Nuh... Ungh!
Rise from the ashes,2,490,Ema,"I-is that right, Mr. Wright!?"
Rise from the ashes,2,491,Phoenix,It seems so. Edgeworth is looking pretty sullen.
Rise from the ashes,2,492,Ema,You could at least study some evidence law! Really!
Rise from the ashes,2,493,Judge,"The prosecution's complaints notwithstanding... It appears that this evidence satisfies the first rule of evidence law. Well... It seems you have yet another count against you, witness."
Rise from the ashes,2,494,Angel,Anything to ensure that the guilty are properly judged.
Rise from the ashes,2,495,Judge,"Very well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness!"
Rise from the ashes,2,496,Angel,I should have mentioned those five minutes when I wasn't looking at the crime scene.
Rise from the ashes,2,497,Phoenix,Why did you lie about those five minutes?
Rise from the ashes,2,498,Angel,"I guess you could say, I just wanted people to look at the results."
Rise from the ashes,2,499,Phoenix,The... results?
Rise from the ashes,2,500,Angel,"How many times do I have to say this? I saw the chief prosecutor stab the victim before my very own eyes! Compared to that... A five minute ""blank"" means nothing!"
Rise from the ashes,2,501,Edgeworth,Then why didn't you just tell the truth!
Rise from the ashes,2,502,Angel,"Don't make me laugh! We're dealing with the most untrustworthy of the vile lot known as prosecutors! Falsified evidence, arranged testimonies, erasing and manipulating evidence... When you fight monsters, you need to use every trick in the book!"
Rise from the ashes,2,503,Phoenix,(This when the suspect is admitting she did it?)
Rise from the ashes,2,504,Judge,"False testimony is the most despicable crime of all, Ms. Starr. Let's just get this over with."
Rise from the ashes,2,505,Angel,"And now, to the matter of the victim's shoe... Did I not bring this up...?"
Rise from the ashes,2,506,Phoenix,"And, you found this shoe at the scene of the crime?"
Rise from the ashes,2,507,Angel,"I detained the chief prosecutor, and notified the Police Department... I wanted to make myself useful while I was waiting for the police to arrive."
Rise from the ashes,2,508,Edgeworth,"So, like an ill-trained pooch, you snuck off with a shoe!"
Rise from the ashes,2,509,Angel,"I was afraid someone would erase the chief prosecutor's crime. This shoe was my secret weapon if that should happen. See this fashionable basket I have here...? It carries more than lunchboxes, gentlemen!"
Rise from the ashes,2,510,Phoenix,"(I'm happy for you and your lunchbox bag, really.)"
Rise from the ashes,2,511,Judge,"In any case, you removed valuable evidence from the scene of the crime.Now, tell us what you did next."
Rise from the ashes,2,512,Angel,Two types of blood were found on this shoe! One was of course the victim's.
Rise from the ashes,2,513,Phoenix,"So, you brought it to the forensics department?"
Rise from the ashes,2,514,Angel,"If you're going to submit something as evidence in court, you need it approved. To do that, evidence must be analyzed... by a forensics expert."
Rise from the ashes,2,515,Phoenix,(And she got away with her little coup because she used to be a detective...)
Rise from the ashes,2,516,Judge,The shoe does appear to have bloodstains on it.
Rise from the ashes,2,517,Angel,"Makes sense. After all, a man was stabbed here."
Rise from the ashes,2,518,Phoenix,"And that blood belonged to the victim, Detective Goodman?"
Rise from the ashes,2,519,Angel,"As I said, there were two types of blood found on the shoe."
Rise from the ashes,2,520,Angel,"And the other was...! The defendant, Ms. Lana Skye's blood!"
Rise from the ashes,2,521,Phoenix,You can't say for sure the blood belonged to the victim with a blood test!
Rise from the ashes,2,522,Angel,"You claim to know something about blood tests, Rookie?"
Rise from the ashes,2,523,Phoenix,Huh...
Rise from the ashes,2,524,Angel,"Well, speak up!"
Rise from the ashes,2,525,Phoenix,"Uh, well... Blood comes in four types... A, B, O, and AB... However! You can't tell from a blood test whether a murder was performed... in cold blood!"
Rise from the ashes,2,526,Angel,...
Rise from the ashes,2,527,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,2,528,Judge,"... That's just a figure of speech, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,2,529,Ema,"Actually, if you combine all the various blood tests, there are millions of types! It's practically impossible to narrow a blood sample down to one person! Or so I hear."
Rise from the ashes,2,530,Phoenix,M-millions of types?
Rise from the ashes,2,531,Angel,"If I had a little more time, I would have gotten DNA test results... But they said there's very little doubt it could be anyone's but Ms. Lana Skye's."
Rise from the ashes,2,532,Judge,Hmm... So the suspect's blood was found on the victim's shoe...
Rise from the ashes,2,533,Edgeworth,That ties her directly to the death of Detective Goodman!
Rise from the ashes,2,534,Phoenix,(I was afraid he was going to say that...)
Rise from the ashes,2,535,Angel,"This shoe proves it! It's flawless, decisive evidence!"
Rise from the ashes,2,536,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,537,Phoenix,(I can't let this evidence go through without a fight!)
Rise from the ashes,2,538,Angel,"You ordered the peppered fish guts, right?"
Rise from the ashes,2,539,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,2,540,Angel,"Some like it hot, Mr. Wright. Some, like your client. She's in enough hot water to make a whole batch of soup."
Rise from the ashes,2,541,Ema,Mr. Wright! Do you or don't you have a problem with this shoe!?
Rise from the ashes,2,542,Phoenix,A problem...? (This is critical! What's wrong with the victim's shoe?)
Rise from the ashes,2,543,Phoenix,If I'm not imagining things... I'd say there is one critical problem with this evidence... A clear contradiction!
Rise from the ashes,2,544,Angel,"That gleam in your eyes... You're still young, Rookie. I'd give you a peppered fish gut now, but you couldn't take the heat, could you!"
Rise from the ashes,2,545,Judge,Let's hear what Mr. Wright has to say! What is contradictory about the victim's shoe? Show us the problem with this evidence!
Rise from the ashes,2,546,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,547,Phoenix,I wonder if you noticed... there's blood on the bottom of this shoe!
Rise from the ashes,2,548,Angel,"Don't mess with me, Rookie... Or it'll be your blood on the bottom of my shoe!"
Rise from the ashes,2,549,Judge,"Hmm... Indeed, there is quite a bit of blood on the bottom of the shoe."
Rise from the ashes,2,550,Edgeworth,It makes sense. The victim was stabbed with a knife! What could possibly be contradictory about blood on the bottom of his shoe!?
Rise from the ashes,2,551,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,552,Phoenix,The problem lies... in the footprint.
Rise from the ashes,2,553,Angel,The... footprint?
Rise from the ashes,2,554,Phoenix,Note that the bottom of the victim's shoe is covered in blood. Then... isn't it strange? Why weren't any bloody footprints found by the scene of the crime!?
Rise from the ashes,2,555,Judge,Ah hah!
Rise from the ashes,2,556,Phoenix,As you can see... There were no traces of any such footprints at the scene of the crime! That contradicts your claim about this shoe!
Rise from the ashes,2,557,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,558,Edgeworth,"This picture only shows part of the floor, so there could have been bloody footprints."
Rise from the ashes,2,559,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,560,Phoenix,If there were bloody prints they would have been found. We checked the scene and found nothing of the sort!
Rise from the ashes,2,561,Judge,"Order! Order! Order! Well, witness!?"
Rise from the ashes,2,562,Angel,"What!? Huh? I, uh..."
Rise from the ashes,2,563,Ema,"Great going, Mr. Wright! But... It's true that the lack of a footprint is a contradiction... But then we have to ask why there wasn't a footprint!"
Rise from the ashes,2,564,Phoenix,Oh!
Rise from the ashes,2,565,Judge,That's true! There has to be a reason why there wasn't a footprint!
Rise from the ashes,2,566,Ema,"Think, Mr. Wright, think!"
Rise from the ashes,2,567,Phoenix,"... Hey, I don't know why it's not there. I'm just good at finding contradictions."
Rise from the ashes,2,568,Ema,What!?
Rise from the ashes,2,569,Edgeworth,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,570,Edgeworth,I see... Now I get it!
Rise from the ashes,2,571,Phoenix,(Get what!?)
Rise from the ashes,2,572,Edgeworth,Our witness is more devious than I gave her credit for! We were hoodwinked to the very end! But she slipped! There is one vital hint to the truth in her testimony...
Rise from the ashes,2,573,Judge,Wh-what are you talking about?
Rise from the ashes,2,574,Edgeworth,Think back to when she told us about apprehending the suspect...
Rise from the ashes,2,575,Angel,"The chief prosecutor tried to resist, but her efforts were in vain. She knocked my hands aside, kicked over an oil drum... Oh, she's beautiful, but deadly! A predator, this one! A leopard woman! Rowr!"
Rise from the ashes,2,576,Edgeworth,I thought that was a strange thing for the normally cool-headed chief to do.
Rise from the ashes,2,577,Phoenix,(No kidding!)
Rise from the ashes,2,578,Edgeworth,"Now, witness. Allow me to ask a very simple question. This ""oil drum""... was it empty?"
Rise from the ashes,2,579,Angel,"... Oh, that, hmm? I'm not sure I like your attitude, Mr. Edgeworth. Though apparently you're not the slowest conveyor belt in the lunchbox factory."
Rise from the ashes,2,580,Judge,Witness! W-well? Was the oil drum empty...?
Rise from the ashes,2,581,Angel,The oil drum kicked over by the chief prosecutor... was brimming with water.
Rise from the ashes,2,582,Phoenix,W-water? (What does that mean?)
Rise from the ashes,2,583,Edgeworth,"Still don't get it, Mr. Wright? Do you want to know the reason she knocked it over? The REAL reason?"
Rise from the ashes,2,584,Judge,Aaaa haaaaah! You don't mean...!
Rise from the ashes,2,585,Edgeworth,"Yes, the suspect knocked over that oil drum for one reason and one reason alone! To erase the blood stains that would become evidence against her!"
Rise from the ashes,2,586,Phoenix,Whaaaaaaaaargh!
Rise from the ashes,2,587,Judge,"That ties things up quite nicely! The blood stains left on the victim's shoes tie her quite clearly to this murder! Then, after the deed was done, she knocked over the oil drum to erase the telltale signs!"
Rise from the ashes,2,588,Angel,"Why, that's a prosecutor's specialty... erasing evidence!"
Rise from the ashes,2,589,Phoenix,(That reminds me... Ms. Skye's right hand was hurt... Didn't she say she'd cut herself when she stabbed him...?)
Rise from the ashes,2,590,Ema,So my sister's blood on the shoe... That's when it happened?
Rise from the ashes,2,591,Judge,Well... I see no reason to prolong this trial.
Rise from the ashes,2,592,Ema,M-Mr. Wright! Do something! Please!
Rise from the ashes,2,593,Phoenix,"W-what!? What can I do? Your sister has confessed to the crime, and she tried to conceal it!"
Rise from the ashes,2,594,Ema,B-but...
Rise from the ashes,2,595,Edgeworth,"Enough. There is no need for further debate. The verdict, Your Honor!"
Rise from the ashes,2,596,Judge,Very well...
Rise from the ashes,2,597,Ema,But Angel Starr is on the prosecution's side! She could have been lying about the water!
Rise from the ashes,2,598,Judge,"This court finds the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye..."
Rise from the ashes,2,599,Angel,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,600,Angel,Little girl... What did you just say?
Rise from the ashes,2,601,Ema,Huh...? M-me?
Rise from the ashes,2,602,Angel,"Did you say that I, Angel Starr... was on the prosecution's side?"
Rise from the ashes,2,603,Ema,"W-well, yeah, you are! You're saying my sister hid evidence by erasing the bloody footprints!"
Rise from the ashes,2,604,Angel,"Well. I thought you'd had your fill, but here you are, demanding a second helping! Another lunchbox... A lunchbox called ""evidence""!"
Rise from the ashes,2,605,Judge,"W-wait... Witness, don't tell me you have something else?"
Rise from the ashes,2,606,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,607,Edgeworth,"You've reached your verdict, Your Honor! Any further comments will be held in contempt of court!"
Rise from the ashes,2,608,Angel,Your threats don't scare the Cough-up Queen! Look at this!!!
Rise from the ashes,2,609,Judge,A photograph...?
Rise from the ashes,2,610,Angel,I had this just in case anyone had the gall to suggest... that the white shoe didn't belong to the victim!
Rise from the ashes,2,611,Judge,Hmm... I see no room for error in this evidence.
Rise from the ashes,2,612,Ema,"M-Mr. Wright, wait! Look at the asphalt in this photo!"
Rise from the ashes,2,613,Phoenix,Hey! It's clearly wet!
Rise from the ashes,2,614,Judge,"Erasing the last trace of doubt from the court's mind. Immediately after the murder, the crime scene was washed with water!"
Rise from the ashes,2,615,Ema,"I-I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I guess I... I couldn't help after all."
Rise from the ashes,2,616,Phoenix,"(It's not your fault... I knew I couldn't win this case from the beginning. And... it seems this is what your sister wanted anyway! ... I'm sorry, Mia...) ... ... ..."
Rise from the ashes,2,617,Mia,Wright... wet or not... Don't be so quick to throw in the towel...
Rise from the ashes,2,618,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,2,619,Mia,Get yourself up off the asphalt... take another good look... Don't give up... Not until the bitter end.
Rise from the ashes,2,620,Phoenix,(This is the last piece of evidence...)
Rise from the ashes,2,621,Judge,Very well! This time I'd like to declare a verdict for good!
Rise from the ashes,2,622,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,623,Phoenix,"Your Honor, wait!"
Rise from the ashes,2,624,Judge,"What is it with you people!? Can't I hand down my verdicts in peace anymore!? Whatever it is, can it wait?"
Rise from the ashes,2,625,Phoenix,"N-no it can't. Then it will be too late! Look at this photograph, the last one submitted... This trial isn't over... until we give each piece of evidence proper consideration!"
Rise from the ashes,2,626,Edgeworth,"So, Wright... Are you saying there's a problem with this latest piece of evidence?"
Rise from the ashes,2,627,Phoenix,"Yeah! (I'll think later!) Yeah, there's a problem! (Right or wrong, I've got to go ahead with this!)"
Rise from the ashes,2,628,Judge,"I suppose since we've come this far, we should give every claim a fair shake. Very well, Mr. Wright. Show the court the problem in this photograph!"
Rise from the ashes,2,629,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,630,Phoenix,The problem in this photograph... is here!
Rise from the ashes,2,631,Edgeworth,What's this...? There's something poking out of the car's muffler!
Rise from the ashes,2,632,Judge,"Wait just a moment, Mr. Edgeworth!"
Rise from the ashes,2,633,Edgeworth,Your Honor?
Rise from the ashes,2,634,Judge,"You just said ""muffler""... However I see no trace of a muffler or scarf of any kind in this photograph!"
Rise from the ashes,2,635,Edgeworth,"... A muffler is also a part on a car or motorcycle, Your Honor. Just think of it as... part of the exhaust system. A pipe..."
Rise from the ashes,2,636,Judge,I see! And... I see! What's that suspicious-looking cloth sticking out of the car's muffler?
Rise from the ashes,2,637,Angel,Hmph! So what if there is something sticking out of the muffler! What does that have to do with this case? Nothing! Absolutely nothing!
Rise from the ashes,2,638,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,639,Phoenix,"Sorry, Ms. Starr... But it's not going to be that easy! In fact, you've already told us why this is important to the case... You said as much in your testimony!!!"
Rise from the ashes,2,640,Angel,Wh-what!?
Rise from the ashes,2,641,Judge,Let's hear what Mr. Wright has on his mind! Tell us why you think this piece of cloth in the muffler is related to this case.
Rise from the ashes,2,642,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,643,Phoenix,Ms. Starr! Recall your testimony for the court...
Rise from the ashes,2,644,Angel,"Ah yes. When I arrested her, she mentioned the muffler! That's what had me confused in my earlier testimony!"
Rise from the ashes,2,645,Angel,Muffler! argh! Yeearrrrgh!
Rise from the ashes,2,646,Phoenix,"Could it be that the ""muffler"" you heard mentioned... Was actually this exhaust pipe!? If so! That means this piece of cloth is vital evidence!"
Rise from the ashes,2,647,Angel,Oh... Whooooooooooo ooooooooooooragh!
Rise from the ashes,2,648,Judge,Well... It seems we will have to suspend the proceedings.
Rise from the ashes,2,649,Angel,Sus... Suspend!?
Rise from the ashes,2,650,Judge,"I find myself wondering about that piece of cloth. If we leave any question unanswered here we do a disservice to the law! Have the car at the crime scene inspected at once, and bring me that cloth! The verdict will wait until after we've seen all the evidence. Agreed...?"
Rise from the ashes,2,651,Edgeworth,... I suppose so.
Rise from the ashes,2,652,Phoenix,(Whew... that was close. But... we made it... at least for now!)
Rise from the ashes,2,653,Judge,The court will adjourn for a thirty minute recess! It's lunchtime after all!
Rise from the ashes,2,654,Phoenix,(He's still hungry!?)
Rise from the ashes,2,655,Ema,Um... Mr. Wright?
Rise from the ashes,2,656,Phoenix,Huh? What?
Rise from the ashes,2,657,Ema,"Are trials... always like this with you? Like you're swimming up from the bottom of a lake, about to reach the surface... But no matter how hard you paddle you never seem to get there..."
Rise from the ashes,2,658,Phoenix,"Pretty much. Except today we're swimming in quicksand. So what happened to your sister, anyway?"
Rise from the ashes,2,659,Ema,Apparently she got called off to the judge's chambers.
Rise from the ashes,2,660,Phoenix,Hmm... Probably something to do with that piece of cloth.
Rise from the ashes,2,661,Ema,"So! This is where we turn this trial around, right? Our only weapon, a tiny, insignificant piece of cloth!"
Rise from the ashes,2,662,Phoenix,I'm the one who's starting to feel tiny and insignificant to tell the truth.
Rise from the ashes,2,663,???,"Hola, Pardner!"
Rise from the ashes,2,664,Marshall,"They say you show a red cloth to a bull, it'll fire up its temper! That's what they told me when I was a young'un, at least."
Rise from the ashes,2,665,Ema,Officer Marshall!
Rise from the ashes,2,666,Marshall,Thought I'd come take a look-see at how the trial's going. Looks like I'm late. They've got the place locked down tighter than a fort in enemy territory!
Rise from the ashes,2,667,Phoenix,"What is going on over there, anyway? All the police I've seen these last two days have been really on edge."
Rise from the ashes,2,668,Marshall,"Don't you got enough on your plate without worrying about other people, compadre? You could be worrying about the chief prosecutor's taste in mufflers, for example."
Rise from the ashes,2,669,Ema,"Um... Officer Marshall? The whole ""muffler"" thing didn't have anything to do with scarves... She wasn't even wearing a scarf!"
Rise from the ashes,2,670,Marshall,You don't say? Now don't that just beat all.
Rise from the ashes,2,671,Ema,...?
Rise from the ashes,2,672,Marshall,"I've seen the red breeze blow at her slender neck many a time... I saw it that day, too. She was wearing a red muffler."
Rise from the ashes,2,673,Ema,What!?
Rise from the ashes,2,674,Marshall,"At the awards ceremony that afternoon. Edgeworth's seen it too, I'd reckon."
Rise from the ashes,2,675,Phoenix,(What does that mean!? In the photograph taken at the crime scene... she wasn't wearing a scarf!)
Rise from the ashes,2,676,Ema,"So, Ms. Starr wasn't mistaken..."
Rise from the ashes,2,677,Marshall,"Well, it's about time. Remember, pardner, sometimes you gotta grab the bull by the horns... and sometimes you just gotta let that bull go where it will. Time will tell!"
Rise from the ashes,2,678,Phoenix,(Ugh... I have a bad feeling about this.)
Rise from the ashes,2,679,Ema,"So... what are we swimming in now, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,2,680,Marshall,"If it's steak sauce, I can hook you up with some fine ribs! Ooh-wee!"
Rise from the ashes,2,681,Judge,I'd... like to... resume...?
Rise from the ashes,2,682,Phoenix,(What's up? The judge keeps looking over at the prosecution...)
Rise from the ashes,2,683,Judge,"Is something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Your face is blue, your lips are purple, you're sweating bullets... That furrowed brow, those grinding teeth, those watery eyes... What's more your eyes are unfocused, you're doubled over, your back is bent..."
Rise from the ashes,2,684,Edgeworth,It... can't... be!! This... can't... happen!
Rise from the ashes,2,685,Ema,I wonder what happened to Mr. Edgeworth?
Rise from the ashes,2,686,Judge,"Well then, I believe it is time we continued on with this trial. During our recess I had requested that the prosecution conduct an investigation..."
Rise from the ashes,2,687,Edgeworth,Th-this is unacceptable!
Rise from the ashes,2,688,Judge,Hmm... It seems our prosecutor is quite beside himself.
Rise from the ashes,2,689,Gant,"Ah, er, excuse me. Knock knock?"
Rise from the ashes,2,690,Judge,...? Who's there?
Rise from the ashes,2,691,Phoenix,"(What's with this guy? A strange, stuffy aura seems to be filling the courtroom.)"
Rise from the ashes,2,692,Ema,Hey! The temperature rose 5.7 degrees when that man came in!
Rise from the ashes,2,693,Phoenix,(Who on earth is he...?)
Rise from the ashes,2,694,Judge,"Ah, it's you..."
Rise from the ashes,2,695,Gant,"Oh! Oh, heh heh. Sorry I'm late, Udgey! The roads were packed. It's just me! Long time no see, eh, Udgey? How ya been? Swim much these days!"
Rise from the ashes,2,696,Judge,"Ah! Hello, hello. No, I've been so busy..."
Rise from the ashes,2,697,Gant,"Busy! Busy-smizzy, Udgey, my boy! You have to make time to relax!"
Rise from the ashes,2,698,Judge,"Y-yes, indeed."
Rise from the ashes,2,699,Ema,Udgey... seems to be his nickname for the judge...?
Rise from the ashes,2,700,Phoenix,"I'm afraid you're right. Very afraid. Um... sorry, but... who are you?"
Rise from the ashes,2,701,Gant,"Ah hah! So you're Wrighto! The attorney! I've heard good things about you, son!"
Rise from the ashes,2,702,Phoenix,"Eh? Uh, th-thanks...?"
Rise from the ashes,2,703,Gant,"So sorry about our little Worthy giving you all that trouble, eh? You know, we should all go swimming together sometime! Jolly!"
Rise from the ashes,2,704,Phoenix,Little... Little Worthy...?
Rise from the ashes,2,705,Judge,Mr. Wright! You don't know the district Chief of Police!?
Rise from the ashes,2,706,Phoenix,Chuh....? Chief of Police...!?
Rise from the ashes,2,707,Judge,He's the top ranking police officer in the entire district!
Rise from the ashes,2,708,Gant,"Name's Gant, Damon Gant. Pleased to meet you, everyone!"
Rise from the ashes,2,709,Judge,"So, uh, to what do we owe this honor today? It's been over... two years since you last came to this courtroom, hasn't it?"
Rise from the ashes,2,710,Gant,"Well, it's Worthy, here. Look at the poor fellow! I just thought I'd help out... by bringing this."
Rise from the ashes,2,711,Phoenix,Hey! Th-that's...!
Rise from the ashes,2,712,Ema,My sister's muffler!
Rise from the ashes,2,713,Phoenix,"(So Ms. Starr wasn't just seeing things! When the crime occurred, Ms. Skye really was wearing that muffler!)"
Rise from the ashes,2,714,Gant,"But to think that it was stuffed into that exhaust pipe... On little Worthy's car, no less! It's really quite embarrassing, even for us."
Rise from the ashes,2,715,Judge,Wh-what's this!?
Rise from the ashes,2,716,Gant,"It's what you'd call a switchblade knife. Quite perplexing, this."
Rise from the ashes,2,717,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,718,Edgeworth,Chief! What kind of outfit are you running!?
Rise from the ashes,2,719,Judge,M-Mr. Edgeworth!
Rise from the ashes,2,720,Edgeworth,"How could they miss such a vital piece of evidence!? If your investigators are this lax, how do you expect us to do our job?"
Rise from the ashes,2,721,Gant,"N-now wait a minute, Worthy!"
Rise from the ashes,2,722,Edgeworth,I've no desire to hear your excuses!
Rise from the ashes,2,723,Gant,I'm telling you to wait! Or didn't you hear me?
Rise from the ashes,2,724,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,2,725,Gant,"Have a look at this document, where it says ""person in charge of investigation""... There's no mistaking that signature... Miles Edgeworth?"
Rise from the ashes,2,726,Edgeworth,"Th-that's no fair! The day of the crime, I-I had..."
Rise from the ashes,2,727,Gant,Your head in the clouds because you got that award! I know how you feel... But you're the person in charge. I'll expect a written apology.
Rise from the ashes,2,728,Edgeworth,What? Are you serious!?
Rise from the ashes,2,729,Gant,"Don't be too upset, we'll find a way to clean up this mess... that you made."
Rise from the ashes,2,730,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,2,731,Ema,This is the first time I've seen Mr. Edgeworth at a loss for words...
Rise from the ashes,2,732,Judge,This kind of major blunder is unlike you Mr. Edgeworth.
Rise from the ashes,2,733,Edgeworth,Gah...!
Rise from the ashes,2,734,Judge,"The court accepts this new evidence. But, I'd like to ask the defense a favor first."
Rise from the ashes,2,735,Phoenix,Y-yes?
Rise from the ashes,2,736,Judge,Just to be sure... I'd like to take a look at the blade of this knife.
Rise from the ashes,2,737,Phoenix,"The b-blade, Your Honor? Well, I don't see why not..."
Rise from the ashes,2,738,Judge,"Could you open it up for me, I wonder?"
Rise from the ashes,2,739,Phoenix,"Yes, well. I think all you have to do is push that switch, and..."
Rise from the ashes,2,740,Judge,"If I cut my finger Mr. Wright, I wouldn't be able to pound my gavel anymore."
Rise from the ashes,2,741,Phoenix,"(Yeah. But if I cut my finger, I wouldn't be able to point it at people anymore...)"
Rise from the ashes,2,742,Ema,Come on! Just hurry up and open it!
Rise from the ashes,2,743,Ema,There's a small tag on this knife.
Rise from the ashes,2,744,Phoenix,"It seems to say ""SL-9 2""..."
Rise from the ashes,2,745,Ema,What does that mean?
Rise from the ashes,2,746,Phoenix,"Well... (I've heard something similar... ""DL-6""... of ""DL-6 Incident"" fame...)"
Rise from the ashes,2,747,Ema,But... it's strange.
Rise from the ashes,2,748,Phoenix,Huh? What is?
Rise from the ashes,2,749,Ema,I'm not certain... But I get the feeling I've seen this somewhere before! Letters like this... or letters that looked a lot like this... somehow.
Rise from the ashes,2,750,Ema,Waaaah! D-don't scare me like that!
Rise from the ashes,2,751,Phoenix,I'm the one who's scared!
Rise from the ashes,2,752,Ema,Look at this knife blade... the tip is broken off.
Rise from the ashes,2,753,Phoenix,(And this dark red stain... blood?)
Rise from the ashes,2,754,Edgeworth,This does not excuse the actions of the Police Department! I would like to hear an explanation from the Chief of Police himself!
Rise from the ashes,2,755,Judge,"I'm terribly sorry, but could I ask you to testify for us? About the split between the prosecutors and the police... and this knife."
Rise from the ashes,2,756,Gant,"Sure! Sure thing. Not a problem, not even a little one! Really!"
Rise from the ashes,2,757,Judge,There... There was a murder at the Police Department!? A detective!?
Rise from the ashes,2,758,Gant,"That's hush-hush information, Udgey! We haven't exactly announced it yet."
Rise from the ashes,2,759,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,760,Edgeworth,"W-wait a second! You said ""5:15""... That's the exact time that Detective Goodman was killed at the Prosecutor's Office!"
Rise from the ashes,2,761,Judge,Order! Order! Order!
Rise from the ashes,2,762,Gant,"Anyway, we at the Department were all a-flustered, as you might well assume. We're in the middle of a top-top-secret investigation. Don't tell anyone, okay?"
Rise from the ashes,2,763,Judge,"I think we understand the Police Department's situation... Well, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,2,764,Phoenix,(Two detectives killed at the same time in two different places...)
Rise from the ashes,2,765,Ema,"The chances of that are really slim. Scientifically speaking, of course."
Rise from the ashes,2,766,Phoenix,I'd... like to exercise my right to cross-examine the witness.
Rise from the ashes,2,767,Judge,Very well... however! Keep your questions focused on the case at hand!
Rise from the ashes,2,768,Gant,This knife is special... but I can't say how here.
Rise from the ashes,2,769,Phoenix,"Excuse me... ""special""?"
Rise from the ashes,2,770,Gant,Mmhmm. Hard to come by this particular knife anywhere else.
Rise from the ashes,2,771,Phoenix,Um... Might that special thing... be this little tag?
Rise from the ashes,2,772,Gant,"Oh! Sorry, Wrighto! But I can't say that now. Not that!"
Rise from the ashes,2,773,Edgeworth,We've established that the knife in Goodman's chest... was this knife. Now why was there another knife at the scene of the crime?
Rise from the ashes,2,774,Judge,That's quite a mystery!
Rise from the ashes,2,775,Gant,"And like a mystery, it's wrapped in something... a muffler!"
Rise from the ashes,2,776,Gant,Unless there's evidence to prove a connection between this knife and Goodman...
Rise from the ashes,2,777,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,778,Phoenix,"This knife was found on the scene of our crime! I think that makes it connected to the case, don't you!?"
Rise from the ashes,2,779,Gant,"See, there's a lot of things that go on at the Department I can't explain... It's... delicate, okay? Sorry, Wrighto!"
Rise from the ashes,2,780,Ema,"Maybe there's something about the knife that will give us a clue! Let's examine that knife while we can, Wrighto!"
Rise from the ashes,2,781,Phoenix,(Hmmm... evidence that links this knife to Detective Goodman... I think perhaps the pieces are falling into place... I should try presenting the piece of evidence that's had me stumped all this time!)
Rise from the ashes,2,782,Edgeworth,"So, how were things down at the Department...?"
Rise from the ashes,2,783,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,784,Phoenix,Wait a second!
Rise from the ashes,2,785,Gant,"Ah, at last! An honest to goodness ""objection""!"
Rise from the ashes,2,786,Phoenix,This knife... This has to have something to do with Detective Goodman!
Rise from the ashes,2,787,Judge,What do you mean!?
Rise from the ashes,2,788,Gant,Ah hah! An honest-to-goodness what do you mean from the judge! This is great!
Rise from the ashes,2,789,Phoenix,"Look at the tag on this knife! It reads ""SL-9 2""..."
Rise from the ashes,2,790,Judge,And this is important... why?
Rise from the ashes,2,791,Phoenix,Over here we also have... A memo that was on the body of the victim!
Rise from the ashes,2,792,Judge,Hmm... what's this? 6 minus 7S... 12/2...?
Rise from the ashes,2,793,Phoenix,Your Honor... It's upside-down.
Rise from the ashes,2,794,Judge,Upside...?
Rise from the ashes,2,795,Phoenix,The printed name on the memo makes it look like it's right-side up... But turn it around and what do you get!?
Rise from the ashes,2,796,Judge,Ah... Ah haaaaah!
Rise from the ashes,2,797,Phoenix,"When he wrote this note, he was holding the paper upside down!"
Rise from the ashes,2,798,Judge,"SL-9... That's the same thing that is written on the knife's tag! Order! Order! Well, Chief?"
Rise from the ashes,2,799,Gant,"... Ah, well. I guess the cat's out of the bag... You win, Wrighto!"
Rise from the ashes,2,800,Phoenix,I... win? Ah... (What game is this guy playing!?)
Rise from the ashes,2,801,Gant,That was a bad day for the Department. We weren't in any shape to do an investigation.
Rise from the ashes,2,802,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,803,Phoenix,"Something didn't happen at the Police Department too, did it...?"
Rise from the ashes,2,804,Gant,"You got a good look in your eyes, there, Wrighto my boy. Sharp! Hungry!"
Rise from the ashes,2,805,Edgeworth,Chief... did something happen? And why haven't I heard?
Rise from the ashes,2,806,Gant,Why haven't you heard? Or why didn't you ask?
Rise from the ashes,2,807,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,2,808,Gant,"No matter, I understand. You were busy, what with Lana's case and all."
Rise from the ashes,2,809,Phoenix,"Well, what happened!? What happened at the Police Department that day?"
Rise from the ashes,2,810,Gant,"The time of the crime? 5:15. Scary coincidence, eh?"
Rise from the ashes,2,811,Phoenix,Five... 5:15...!? B-but that's... That's when Detective Goodman was killed in the Prosecutor's Office!
Rise from the ashes,2,812,Judge,What!?
Rise from the ashes,2,813,Gant,"Funny, isn't it? A murder at the Prosecutor's place, and a murder at our place at the very same time! What are the chances!"
Rise from the ashes,2,814,Phoenix,(Coincidence!?)
Rise from the ashes,2,815,Ema,This is just my gut feeling... but I'd say there's a 0.001% chance of that happening!
Rise from the ashes,2,816,Phoenix,"Chief Gant, please tell us more about the incident!"
Rise from the ashes,2,817,Gant,"It's not officially linked to this here case, so I can't talk much about it."
Rise from the ashes,2,818,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,819,Phoenix,How can you say there's no connection!?
Rise from the ashes,2,820,Gant,"How? Because I'm the Chief of Police! I can't just say anything I please, Wrighto. You understand!"
Rise from the ashes,2,821,Judge,"Try to understand, Wrighto."
Rise from the ashes,2,822,Gant,"Well, if you can prove there is a connection, more power to you. Maybe there is something that ties the two murders together?"
Rise from the ashes,2,823,Phoenix,"(Whatever it is, I'd better find it and get to the bottom of this!)"
Rise from the ashes,2,824,Gant,This knife is special... but I can't say how here.
Rise from the ashes,2,825,Gant,This knife was evidence in a case. It was stolen from the Department's evidence room.
Rise from the ashes,2,826,Phoenix,So this knife... was stolen?
Rise from the ashes,2,827,Gant,"Yes, but on the day of the murder."
Rise from the ashes,2,828,Edgeworth,"It was evidence, you say. Was it, in fact, a murder weapon?"
Rise from the ashes,2,829,Gant,"Nice! Nice! Nice! Good show, little Worthy! It was a murder weapon, as it happens. It was evidence from a case long-since solved..."
Rise from the ashes,2,830,Phoenix,(So this knife was stolen on the day of the murder... And it was found in the exhaust pipe of Edgeworth's car...)
Rise from the ashes,2,831,Ema,Hard to think there isn't a connection there!
Rise from the ashes,2,832,Gant,That was a bad day for the Department. We weren't in any shape to do an investigation.
Rise from the ashes,2,833,Gant,"A detective was killed at the Police Department, see... what a mess!"
Rise from the ashes,2,834,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,835,Phoenix,On the same day that a detective was killed in the Prosecutor's parking lot... Another detective... was killed at the Police Department!?
Rise from the ashes,2,836,Gant,"That's a fact. Surprising, isn't it, Udgey?"
Rise from the ashes,2,837,Judge,I'm at a loss for words.
Rise from the ashes,2,838,Edgeworth,And the perpetrator? Do you have a suspect?
Rise from the ashes,2,839,Gant,"Well, there was a suspect. Just arrested 'em, in fact."
Rise from the ashes,2,840,Phoenix,(Just arrested! That was quick...)
Rise from the ashes,2,841,Gant,"But... there's still a lot of unanswered questions. Maybe you could help, Wright!"
Rise from the ashes,2,842,Phoenix,I suppose I could help... if you help me by giving me data on your case?
Rise from the ashes,2,843,Gant,"Oooh, good one! This kid's sharp! Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you one thing and one thing only..."
Rise from the ashes,2,844,Phoenix,"So, tell me... where was the victim found?"
Rise from the ashes,2,845,Gant,"... Well, I can't speak on where the corpse was found. But I can say the crime took place in the evidence room at the Police Department."
Rise from the ashes,2,846,Phoenix,(The evidence room!?)
Rise from the ashes,2,847,Phoenix,(W-wait a second... I have heard of that!)
Rise from the ashes,2,848,Ema,The evidence room... Didn't he mention that in his testimony just now?
Rise from the ashes,2,849,Gant,This knife was evidence in a case. It was stolen from the Department's evidence room.
Rise from the ashes,2,850,Phoenix,(There's the connection between the two cases!)
Rise from the ashes,2,851,Ema,"You seem happy, Mr. Wright!"
Rise from the ashes,2,852,Phoenix,"Happy? We just got handed our ticket to go to town on this case! (With the link between the two cases established, we finally have some leverage. Now we can get Gant to testify about the details!)"
Rise from the ashes,2,853,Gant,"The time of the crime? 5:15. Scary coincidence, eh?"
Rise from the ashes,2,854,Gant,"It's not officially linked to this here case, so I can't talk much about it."
Rise from the ashes,2,855,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,856,Phoenix,Chief... The defense's position is simply this: The connection between these two cases has already been proven!
Rise from the ashes,2,857,Gant,"Heh, you don't say? Well, out with it Wrighto! What's your connection?"
Rise from the ashes,2,858,Judge,"Yes, out with it, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,2,859,Phoenix,"The connection is a place, mentioned in the testimony we just heard. The knife found in the lot was stolen... from the Police Department's evidence room."
Rise from the ashes,2,860,Edgeworth,Not to mention the victim had written down the numbers on the knife's evidence tag.
Rise from the ashes,2,861,Phoenix,And we also know that the detective murdered at the Police Department... was killed in that very same evidence room!
Rise from the ashes,2,862,Judge,Indeed... There do seem to be too many connections for it to be a coincidence.
Rise from the ashes,2,863,Gant,You two make a good pair. It took my men two days to find out what you deduced right here.
Rise from the ashes,2,864,Edgeworth,Chief! I request that you release your information on the victim at the Police Department!
Rise from the ashes,2,865,Gant,"See, that's the tricky part. It hasn't been announced yet, and all..."
Rise from the ashes,2,866,Phoenix,Can we get the information... unofficially?
Rise from the ashes,2,867,Gant,"Hmmmmm... Sure! Why not? It's unofficial, after all."
Rise from the ashes,2,868,Phoenix,(What? Really!?)
Rise from the ashes,2,869,Ema,Who would have guessed?
Rise from the ashes,2,870,Gant,"I'll cooperate, but I can't reveal the name of the victim at the Department, okay?"
Rise from the ashes,2,871,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,872,Phoenix,"If you're going to tell us a little, why not tell us everything?"
Rise from the ashes,2,873,Gant,"Ah, well, case information is sticky stuff. You have to do everything properly."
Rise from the ashes,2,874,Phoenix,(Oh well... I guess I might as well try to get what I can out of him...)
Rise from the ashes,2,875,Phoenix,Okay... How about you tell me the victim's ID number?
Rise from the ashes,2,876,Gant,"Hmm? Sure, why not. It's not like you'll be able to tell who it is from that!"
Rise from the ashes,2,877,Phoenix,"Of course not. You won't tell me their name, after all."
Rise from the ashes,2,878,Gant,"We keep a tight lid on ID numbers, so don't go getting your hopes up. The number is... 5842189."
Rise from the ashes,2,879,Judge,Well! That's quite... long!
Rise from the ashes,2,880,Gant,And we have to remember these! It drives me nuts!
Rise from the ashes,2,881,Judge,8... 2... I can't do it.
Rise from the ashes,2,882,Phoenix,(You didn't even get the first number right!)
Rise from the ashes,2,883,Judge,"Well, Mr. Wright? Does this tell you anything?"
Rise from the ashes,2,884,Phoenix,(The ID number of the victim at the Police Department... 5842189...)
Rise from the ashes,2,885,Phoenix,"Actually, it does, Your Honor. It does...! I think!"
Rise from the ashes,2,886,Judge,Meaning?
Rise from the ashes,2,887,Phoenix,(It has to be what I think it is... But what does this mean?)
Rise from the ashes,2,888,Judge,"Well, let's hear what the defense has to say. You say the ID number of the detective who was murdered at the Police Department... tells you something? What does it tell you!?"
Rise from the ashes,2,889,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,890,Phoenix,Witness! ...
Rise from the ashes,2,891,Gant,...
Rise from the ashes,2,892,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,2,893,Judge,"... What is it, Mr. Wright!? You're grinning like a schoolgirl on prom night!"
Rise from the ashes,2,894,Phoenix,"No, I... it's just, I got confused..."
Rise from the ashes,2,895,Edgeworth,And this is news?
Rise from the ashes,2,896,Phoenix,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,2,897,Edgeworth,Just come out with both guns blazing... like you always do.
Rise from the ashes,2,898,Phoenix,"(The Police Department... the Prosecutor's Office... Two places, two detectives murdered... at one time.) Actually, I happen to have a police ID number here."
Rise from the ashes,2,899,Judge,Oh hoh! Is it yours?
Rise from the ashes,2,900,Phoenix,"N-no, Your Honor. I'm a defense attorney... remember? This is the ID number of our victim, Detective Goodman."
Rise from the ashes,2,901,Gant,"Shame on you, Wrighto! Personnel IDs are top secret!"
Rise from the ashes,2,902,Phoenix,"Detective Goodman's ID number is... ""5842189."""
Rise from the ashes,2,903,Gant,...
Rise from the ashes,2,904,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,2,905,Judge,"... And...? This means... what, exactly?"
Rise from the ashes,2,906,Phoenix,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,2,907,Judge,"Wait... That ID number we heard from the Chief earlier.. That started with ""82..."" Hmm. I've forgotten."
Rise from the ashes,2,908,Phoenix,(You even got the first number wrong!) The number the Chief of Police gave us was... 5842189.
Rise from the ashes,2,909,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,910,Edgeworth,"W-wait a second, Wright! What does this...?"
Rise from the ashes,2,911,Phoenix,Mean? That's what I want to know! The two ID numbers are identical! In other words... The detective killed in the Police Department's evidence room was Bruce Goodman!
Rise from the ashes,2,912,Phoenix,What does our witness think about that!?
Rise from the ashes,2,913,Gant,"... Oh! Ho ho ho, sharp as a tack, Wrighto! Sharp as a tack!"
Rise from the ashes,2,914,Judge,B-but wait! Detective Goodman is OUR victim! He was killed at 5:15 in the underground parking lot!
Rise from the ashes,2,915,Phoenix,"Yet, a Detective Bruce Goodman was also killed at the Police Department... In the evidence room... at the exact same time!"
Rise from the ashes,2,916,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,917,Edgeworth,"Th-that's impossible! So, what we're saying is... The same person was killed at the same time!? And in a completely different location!?"
Rise from the ashes,2,918,Judge,Order! Order! Order! Chief! What does this mean!?
Rise from the ashes,2,919,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,920,Edgeworth,"No... what I want to know is... why didn't I hear about this!? Yes, it's top-secret, fine! But I'm the prosecutor in charge of the case!!!"
Rise from the ashes,2,921,Gant,"Now, just wait a second, Worthy. No need to get all flustered."
Rise from the ashes,2,922,Edgeworth,Your Honor! The Police Department has made a grave error in this case...
Rise from the ashes,2,923,Gant,"Wait. I said ""wait."" Or didn't you hear me?"
Rise from the ashes,2,924,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,2,925,Gant,The oversight... the grave error...? Mr. Edgeworth... They're yours.
Rise from the ashes,2,926,Edgeworth,Wh-what!? How... how dare...
Rise from the ashes,2,927,Gant,We informed you yesterday. I believe it was our Officer Meekins who brought you the news?
Rise from the ashes,2,928,Edgeworth,O-officer... Meekins?
Rise from the ashes,2,929,Ema,Mr. Wright! Where have we heard that name before? Wait... Ah hah!
Rise from the ashes,2,930,Officer,"Erm...! Excuse me! But is Mr. Edgeworth, uh... anywhere on the premises? I'm here, sir, at the request of the chief, sir! I've got your report, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,2,931,Edgeworth,You don't mean... him!?
Rise from the ashes,2,932,Gant,"According to Meekins, you didn't accept the report?"
Rise from the ashes,2,933,Gant,Hard to believe.
Rise from the ashes,2,934,Edgeworth,"B-but your officer, he told me! He said that report had nothing to do with the Lana Skye incident!"
Rise from the ashes,2,935,Gant,[Detective Bruce Goodman murdered in the Police Department evidence room...] Mr. Edgeworth. The victim's name is written right on the top of the report.
Rise from the ashes,2,936,Edgeworth,Gaaaaaaah! Wh-why didn't your officer tell me!?
Rise from the ashes,2,937,Ema,"Honestly, I'm not sure if that officer was capable of making the connection... He did seem... challenged."
Rise from the ashes,2,938,Gant,"In any case, this is a serious error, a gross negligence of duty on your part, Worthy."
Rise from the ashes,2,939,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,2,940,Edgeworth,"B-But, sir!!! You could have submitted that report this morning to the court, as evidence! Then, I..."
Rise from the ashes,2,941,Gant,"No such luck this time, Worthy... or should I say, un-Worthy?"
Rise from the ashes,2,942,Edgeworth,What!?
Rise from the ashes,2,943,Gant,"Now what was the second rule of evidence law, hmm?"
Rise from the ashes,2,944,Ema,"Well, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,2,945,Phoenix,"Huh? Oh, well, it's, uh..."
Rise from the ashes,2,946,Edgeworth,Rule 2: New evidence may only be submitted if it concerns the case on trial. And how is this relevant!?
Rise from the ashes,2,947,Gant,"Normally, you submit a list of evidence to be used in court before the trial. This report wasn't on that list..."
Rise from the ashes,2,948,Judge,So... What does this mean?
Rise from the ashes,2,949,Gant,I couldn't submit this evidence until a connection was proven in court.
Rise from the ashes,2,950,Edgeworth,...!!
Rise from the ashes,2,951,Gant,"That connection was just proven by Wrighto over here. Good job, Wrighto, my boy!"
Rise from the ashes,2,952,Phoenix,Huh? Uh... I... I was just doing my job.
Rise from the ashes,2,953,Edgeworth,No... Noooooooooooooo!!!
Rise from the ashes,2,954,Judge,It seems... we have come to the end of this trial.
Rise from the ashes,2,955,Gant,"You are becoming a thorn in my side, Worthy... There've been rumors... After all, you were in the defendant's chair just last year...!"
Rise from the ashes,2,956,Edgeworth,...! I apologize for this terrible lack of due diligence on my part...
Rise from the ashes,2,957,Judge,M-Mr. Edgeworth!
Rise from the ashes,2,958,Edgeworth,Please... Just give me one day. I'll get to the bottom of what happened... If it's the last thing I do!
Rise from the ashes,2,959,Gant,You'd better get results this time. Really.
Rise from the ashes,2,960,Edgeworth,I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
Rise from the ashes,2,961,Ema,Poor Mr. Edgeworth...
Rise from the ashes,2,962,Judge,"I don't think there's ever been an error this serious in the history of this court. We will grant one further day as the prosecution has requested. Will this be sufficient, Mr. Edgeworth."
Rise from the ashes,2,963,Edgeworth,"Yes, Your Honor. Thank you."
Rise from the ashes,2,964,Judge,"Whatever your punishment for this is, for your sake I hope it's not... decisive. Very well! Court is adjourned!"
Rise from the ashes,3,0,Ema,"Uh... um, Mr. Wright! So... What's going on with the case, anyway!? I... I'm a little confused."
Rise from the ashes,3,1,Phoenix,"Huh!? W-well, um... let's see. (What is going on?) The victim, Detective Bruce Goodman, was stabbed to death after 5:00 PM on the 21st. He died in the Prosecutor's parking lot... and the Police Department's evidence room."
Rise from the ashes,3,2,Ema,"What's this ""and the evidence room"" part!? The Prosecutor's Office and the Police Department are 30 minutes apart by car."
Rise from the ashes,3,3,Phoenix,"... Well... that's what we're going to find out. (Or try to, at least...)"
Rise from the ashes,3,4,Ema,... Alright! Let's do it!
Rise from the ashes,3,5,Phoenix,"(Glad she's in good spirits, but I'm not sure she's going to be much help with this...)"
Rise from the ashes,3,6,Ema,"Don't be so sure, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,3,7,Phoenix,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,3,8,Ema,Would you mind coming with me? I'll prove that these thick- rimmed glasses of mine aren't just for show! Let's go! Science awaits us!
Rise from the ashes,3,9,Ema,"You know, I really don't think we should worry about the Police Department murder! There wasn't even a body found there! Who cares?"
Rise from the ashes,3,10,Phoenix,(Of course it was our victim who was killed at the Department...)
Rise from the ashes,3,11,Ema,And my sister would Never do such a thing! I know it...
Rise from the ashes,3,12,Edgeworth,That oil drum... Was it empty?
Rise from the ashes,3,13,Angel,The oil drum kicked over by the Chief Prosecutor... was brimming with water!
Rise from the ashes,3,14,Ema,"My sister, erasing evidence at the crime scene? Never!"
Rise from the ashes,3,15,Phoenix,"(Even though she says they don't get along, Ema really likes her sister...)"
Rise from the ashes,3,16,Ema,That's not it at all! It's just... We're both professionals at what we do... and I trust her!
Rise from the ashes,3,17,Phoenix,"(Big words for a high school student.) Well, whether there was blood stains or not... The water in that oil drum washed it all away."
Rise from the ashes,3,18,Ema,"He he heh. Ignore the strength of my science at your own peril, Mr. Wright!"
Rise from the ashes,3,19,Phoenix,Huh? What's that grin for?
Rise from the ashes,3,20,Ema,"This situation calls for one thing, and that is... Luminol testing fluid!"
Rise from the ashes,3,21,Phoenix,L-luminol?
Rise from the ashes,3,22,Ema,"Blood is sticky stuff, you know. You can't just wash it away with a little water. Even if you can't see it, it's still there..."
Rise from the ashes,3,23,Phoenix,But wouldn't the police have already done those tests?
Rise from the ashes,3,24,Ema,"Never trust anyone's eyes but your own, Mr. Wright! Just give it a try!"
Rise from the ashes,3,25,Phoenix,M-me? Why do I have to do it!?
Rise from the ashes,3,26,Ema,I'm a minor! I can't even drink yet!
Rise from the ashes,3,27,Phoenix,"(We're testing blood stains with this stuff, not drinking it...)"
Rise from the ashes,3,28,Ema,"Here, look, I'll lend you these glasses."
Rise from the ashes,3,29,Phoenix,Huh? You had an extra pair of those things?
Rise from the ashes,3,30,Ema,"To test for a blood reaction, just spray the luminol on it. Like this, see? Touch the screen to spray it on. Okay! Let's find us some bloodstains!"
Rise from the ashes,3,31,Phoenix,"(I can see her eyes shining behind those glasses...) So, is this a bloodstain?"
Rise from the ashes,3,32,Ema,Uhhhh... It's so... ugh!
Rise from the ashes,3,33,Phoenix,"Ema, you're shaking."
Rise from the ashes,3,34,Ema,It's just... this is my first time seeing real blood!
Rise from the ashes,3,35,Phoenix,(Scientific investigation in action...)
Rise from the ashes,3,36,Ema,"O-okay, well, we definitely know that this is a bloodstain. But, doesn't something strike you as odd? Scientifically speaking, of course?"
Rise from the ashes,3,37,Phoenix,(What's odd about this... scientifically?)
Rise from the ashes,3,38,Phoenix,"The perpetrator and Detective Goodman fought here, right? Don't you think there'd be a little more blood?"
Rise from the ashes,3,39,Ema,I definitely think so! I mean... Look at all the blood on the sole of the victim's shoe!
Rise from the ashes,3,40,Phoenix,"(It's strange! If they fought here, there'd have to be more bloodstains than this.)"
Rise from the ashes,3,41,Ema,"Uh, h-hey, Mr. Wright! See how I'm marking up the floor plans when we find a blood stain? See... I'm pretty handy to have around, right?"
Rise from the ashes,3,42,Phoenix,"Uh, yeah. That's very... useful information to have."
Rise from the ashes,3,43,Ema,I saved up my allowance to buy this!
Rise from the ashes,3,44,Phoenix,Luminol Testing Fluid information received from Ema.
Rise from the ashes,3,45,Ema,We can't be sure that the police will reveal all their evidence in court. Sometimes they fail to mention evidence that doesn't fit with their view of the case.
Rise from the ashes,3,46,Phoenix,"And we'll drag that ""hidden evidence"" out into the light of day!"
Rise from the ashes,3,47,Ema,"Yeah! It feels like we're really investigating a crime now, doesn't it?"
Rise from the ashes,3,48,Phoenix,(This luminol stuff is going to come in handy.)
Rise from the ashes,3,49,Angel,Hah!
Rise from the ashes,3,50,Angel,I wonder how that fluid of yours would react to a nice Deli Box?
Rise from the ashes,3,51,Ema,Ms. Starr!
Rise from the ashes,3,52,Angel,"You only trust your own eyes, hm? Not bad, you two... This day-old Deli Box is on the house..."
Rise from the ashes,3,53,Phoenix,"Sorry, it's just, that kind of lead in doesn't really get my mouth watering."
Rise from the ashes,3,54,Angel,You certainly put me in a tight spot today.
Rise from the ashes,3,55,Phoenix,"My apologies, Ms. Starr, but..."
Rise from the ashes,3,56,Angel,"No, no, it's okay. It was my fault."
Rise from the ashes,3,57,Ema,"Oh, we know."
Rise from the ashes,3,58,Angel,"I witnessed everything from that security room right there. But... I was afraid that wouldn't wound convincing enough, you see... I was wrong to think that. I'm sorry."
Rise from the ashes,3,59,Ema,Sorry? You lied on the witness stand! That's unforgivable!
Rise from the ashes,3,60,Angel,"... Little girl, don't forget what's important here. Even if the place I witnessed the events from was different, I still saw what I saw. I saw Chief Prosecutor Skye stab a man in cold blood, and that testimony still stands!"
Rise from the ashes,3,61,Ema,Ah...
Rise from the ashes,3,62,Angel,I swear it on my honor as a detective! She stabbed Goodman!
Rise from the ashes,3,63,Ema,...!
Rise from the ashes,3,64,Phoenix,(I know this photograph has something important to tell us... but what?)
Rise from the ashes,3,65,Angel,"If you think about it, I could have taken that picture from the guard room. But... even I get flustered sometimes."
Rise from the ashes,3,66,Phoenix,"So, you went straight to the scene of the crime?"
Rise from the ashes,3,67,Angel,"And climbed the chain link fence in an effort to stop the murder? That's when I took this photo, yes."
Rise from the ashes,3,68,Ema,In other words... five minutes after the crime?
Rise from the ashes,3,69,Angel,"Those five minutes are the whole problem... The hole in my testimony, as it were."
Rise from the ashes,3,70,Ema,"The five minutes weren't the problem, Ms. Starr, you lying was the problem!"
Rise from the ashes,3,71,Angel,"Listen, little girl. I've had my testimony ""disregarded"" before... And I wasn't going to have it disregarded again! Just like that time..."
Rise from the ashes,3,72,Phoenix,(That time...?)
Rise from the ashes,3,73,Ema,Um... What do you think about this?
Rise from the ashes,3,74,Angel,"""SL-9 Incident""... On that knife... And on that note... Goodman... Goodman was the head detective on that case, you know."
Rise from the ashes,3,75,Ema,Really?
Rise from the ashes,3,76,Angel,That knife was evidence from that case... the murder weapon. It was due for transferal the very day that Goodman was killed. As I suspected... SL-9 isn't over! Not yet!
Rise from the ashes,3,77,Phoenix,Do you think you could tell us more about the SL-9 Incident?
Rise from the ashes,3,78,Ema,"So... you were a detective, weren't you, Ms. Starr?"
Rise from the ashes,3,79,Angel,"Yes... It was a long time ago. Well, two years ago. No matter how hardened the criminal, when they faced me... They coughed it up."
Rise from the ashes,3,80,Phoenix,Coughed it... up?
Rise from the ashes,3,81,Angel,"They confessed. They babbled like babies. You know, I may seem like a demon sometimes... But I can be an angel, too."
Rise from the ashes,3,82,Phoenix,I wouldn't doubt it.
Rise from the ashes,3,83,Angel,"Every day, I dragged the dirt out of the mouths of suspect after suspect... And before long, they called me... The Cough-up Queen!"
Rise from the ashes,3,84,Ema,"Oh, and here I had thought someone had gotten food poisoning from your lunches."
Rise from the ashes,3,85,Phoenix,"And... you were ""let go""? Er... fired?"
Rise from the ashes,3,86,Angel,"I felt that I had found my dream job when I became an investigator... And if these prim and proper prosecutors hadn't let me go, I'd still be one today."
Rise from the ashes,3,87,Angel,It's all because of that case... The SL-9 Incident.
Rise from the ashes,3,88,Phoenix,Ess... el..? (Wait! She doesn't mean...!)
Rise from the ashes,3,89,Angel,That's when I learned the truth. We're nothing to them. Disposable.
Rise from the ashes,3,90,Ema,Disposable?
Rise from the ashes,3,91,Angel,Two years ago... it was the biggest case I'd ever handled. The police and the prosecutors were desperate for decisive evidence.
Rise from the ashes,3,92,Ema,So... they didn't solve it?
Rise from the ashes,3,93,Angel,On the contrary. It was solved quite cleanly. The criminal was caught and executed.
Rise from the ashes,3,94,Phoenix,(E-executed...?)
Rise from the ashes,3,95,Angel,"Yes, the criminal got what was coming to him. It doesn't get any cleaner than that. The only problem was... they never did find decisive evidence. Not even a little."
Rise from the ashes,3,96,Phoenix,"What!? But the criminal was executed, right?"
Rise from the ashes,3,97,Angel,Evidence... of a sort. Made up evidence.
Rise from the ashes,3,98,Ema,Wh-what? You mean they executed someone with fabricated evidence!?
Rise from the ashes,3,99,Angel,"... The best part came several months after the trial. Every detective involved with the case was dealt with. Some were demoted to patrolmen, others found themselves out of a job..."
Rise from the ashes,3,100,Ema,And... you were one of those?
Rise from the ashes,3,101,Angel,"Myself, and one other person you know well."
Rise from the ashes,3,102,Phoenix,"(Wait, could it be...?)"
Rise from the ashes,3,103,Angel,"Exactly. Officer Jake Marshall. He's on security detail in the Police Department, isn't he?"
Rise from the ashes,3,104,Angel,"As professional detectives, we investigated that case from every angle. Jake was particularly determined. And then... it was over. And he was demoted. However... He hasn't forgotten. And neither have I!"
Rise from the ashes,3,105,Phoenix,You haven't forgotten SL-9?
Rise from the ashes,3,106,Angel,"There was another side to that case, a hidden side. That's what we're after now. And no one up in their fancy offices can stop us."
Rise from the ashes,3,107,Ema,Wait! Th-those lunches you sell...
Rise from the ashes,3,108,Angel,There is only one reason I come to sell lunches in this accursed office. I come here to meet old friends... boyfriends that can help me investigate.
Rise from the ashes,3,109,Phoenix,"(Ms. Starr's old boyfriends... How many does she have, anyway?)"
Rise from the ashes,3,110,Phoenix,"(Just when the detectives on this case have disappeared, we find new evidence...)"
Rise from the ashes,3,111,Ema,There has to be a connection!
Rise from the ashes,3,112,Angel,"So, Rookie..."
Rise from the ashes,3,113,Phoenix,Wh-what!
Rise from the ashes,3,114,Angel,It seems like you're serious about investigating this case...
Rise from the ashes,3,115,Phoenix,Yes.
Rise from the ashes,3,116,Angel,Then you should take this.
Rise from the ashes,3,117,Phoenix,A... Salisbury Steak Lunch?
Rise from the ashes,3,118,Angel,I know a certain guy who might help you if you tempt him with this treat...
Rise from the ashes,3,119,Ema,"Um, Ms. Starr...? Officer Marshall... is he your... uh, are you his...? Are you g-g-g-going out!?"
Rise from the ashes,3,120,Angel,Why do you want to know?
Rise from the ashes,3,121,Ema,"I was just wondering what happened to him? A long time ago, when he was helping my sister do cases, he was so nice. He got along so well with my sister, it made me jealous. And... he was nice to me too, back then."
Rise from the ashes,3,122,Phoenix,(This would be when Officer Marshall was a detective.)
Rise from the ashes,3,123,Ema,But now... now he's so cold!
Rise from the ashes,3,124,Angel,"... Jake and I are merely cooperating on this investigation. We're putting the past to rest, as it were. Nothing more than that."
Rise from the ashes,3,125,Ema,I... I see. Thank you.
Rise from the ashes,3,126,Phoenix,(Officer Jake Marshall... Hmm...)
Rise from the ashes,3,127,Ema,"Still, I do feel better about things. A little. I mean, they caught the person who stabbed Detective Goodman, didn't they?"
Rise from the ashes,3,128,Phoenix,"Uh, yeah, I guess they did. (Best to not go too far down that road right now. Things will just get confusing.)"
Rise from the ashes,3,129,_,*WHEEEEEEEEEEEEN*
Rise from the ashes,3,130,Ema,Wh-what was that!?
Rise from the ashes,3,131,Meekins,"Sir! That's what I'm saying! Me, a perpetrator? I-I-I'd say I-I-I was the perpetrated against, sir! That's what I'd say! Ah, oh, uh. Hi. Greetings, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,3,132,Ema,"Wait, I know who you are..."
Rise from the ashes,3,133,Meekins,"Excuse me! But is Mr. Edgeworth, uh... anywhere on the premises? I'm here, sir, at the request of the Chief, sir! I've got your report, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,3,134,Ema,Officer Meekins! So you're a guard here at the detention center?
Rise from the ashes,3,135,Meekins,"No, sir! I'm not, sir! I'm a little lost patrolman, like a little lost lamb, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,3,136,Ema,"Oh, I get it. You're here to deliver a report?"
Rise from the ashes,3,137,Meekins,"No, sir, I, uh, how should I say this..."
Rise from the ashes,3,138,Phoenix,(Wait... he isn't... is he?) You... Officer Meekins... You didn't... did you?
Rise from the ashes,3,139,Meekins,Err..........
Rise from the ashes,3,140,Meekins,"Perpetrator Officer Meekins reporting, sir!!!"
Rise from the ashes,3,141,Ema,What...!? Whaaaaaaaaat!?
Rise from the ashes,3,142,Phoenix,(Now this is an unexpected turn of events...)
Rise from the ashes,3,143,Meekins,"Sir! I'm a patrolman with General Affairs, sir! SIR!"
Rise from the ashes,3,144,Phoenix,"Ow. I can hear you fine, Officer Meekins."
Rise from the ashes,3,145,Meekins,"I had some business that day, sir, and so I went to the evidence room, sir... The guard office in front of the room was empty, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,3,146,Ema,"So, normally there's a guard at the evidence room?"
Rise from the ashes,3,147,Meekins,"That's right, sir! Because evidence is kept in the evidence room, sir! Now, the security officer... was none other than Officer Marshall!"
Rise from the ashes,3,148,Phoenix,(M-Marshall!?)
Rise from the ashes,3,149,Meekins,"Then, sir, I happened to glance at the security room monitor! That's when I saw him, sir! A suspicious person in the evidence room! A suspicious person, sir! A suspicious person! Yowwowowowowowow!!!"
Rise from the ashes,3,150,Phoenix,(What the heck is this guy doing?)
Rise from the ashes,3,151,Ema,So what happened then?
Rise from the ashes,3,152,Meekins,"After that, sir, I... I... everything went white! I saw red! I blacked out! And... when I came to, I was here. In the detention center."
Rise from the ashes,3,153,Phoenix,(How long were you out!? Days!?)
Rise from the ashes,3,154,Ema,"Um, might I ask... what happened to your hand?"
Rise from the ashes,3,155,Meekins,"Sir! There was no one to bandage me, sir! So I did what I could to wrap it up, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,3,156,Phoenix,(A bandage on his hand... just like Ms. Skye.)
Rise from the ashes,3,157,Ema,Yet another similarity between this case and the one at the Prosecutor's Office...
Rise from the ashes,3,158,Phoenix,First things first... tell us how you hurt your hand!
Rise from the ashes,3,159,Phoenix,"Um, I don't mean to pry, but you are the perpetrator, correct? You killed Detective Bruce Goodman in the evidence room... right?"
Rise from the ashes,3,160,Meekins,"Sir... Please don't look at me with those sad puppy dog eyes, sir! If you have to label me as persecutor or victim, sir... Then label me victim!"
Rise from the ashes,3,161,Phoenix,"Um, I would, but you happen to be in detention. And alive and well at that."
Rise from the ashes,3,162,Meekins,"Ah, yes, well, that's true, sir. I suppose you could say that."
Rise from the ashes,3,163,Phoenix,"Did you know the victim, Detective Goodman?"
Rise from the ashes,3,164,Meekins,"Well, sir, if I had to label him as a ""stranger"" or a ""total stranger""... Then I'd say he leans heavily on the ""total stranger"" side!"
Rise from the ashes,3,165,Phoenix,So... you didn't know him?
Rise from the ashes,3,166,Meekins,"Sir! I work in a tiny department, devoid of light or other creature comforts! I don't know any detectives!"
Rise from the ashes,3,167,Ema,"So, if he was a total stranger, why did you stab him?"
Rise from the ashes,3,168,Meekins,"Sir! I had n-no intention of killing him, sir! None! N-nor do I have any recollection of k-killing him, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,3,169,Phoenix,(At least someone around here is more confused than I am.)
Rise from the ashes,3,170,Ema,Um... do you think you could take a look at this?
Rise from the ashes,3,171,Meekins,"... Hey! That's it, sir! That's it! That's it!!!"
Rise from the ashes,3,172,Ema,That's what!?
Rise from the ashes,3,173,Meekins,"My head was a blank until this very moment! But, sir, now I remember! I remember, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,3,174,Phoenix,You mean you remember what happened?
Rise from the ashes,3,175,Meekins,"Correct! That card, that card was the cause of it all!"
Rise from the ashes,3,176,Ema,This... ID card?
Rise from the ashes,3,177,Meekins,"Exactly, sir! That's exactly it! Nothing could be more exact, sir! Nothing!"
Rise from the ashes,3,178,Phoenix,(I'd better pry into this one a little deeper.)
Rise from the ashes,3,179,Phoenix,"Can you tell me what it is you do ""remember""?"
Rise from the ashes,3,180,Meekins,"Well sir, you might say I'm a lost little patrolman. A lost little lamb, if you will! I didn't know Mr. Detective Goodman who was in the evidence room."
Rise from the ashes,3,181,Phoenix,And that's why you thought he looked suspicious...
Rise from the ashes,3,182,Meekins,"Sir, I entered the evidence room, and asked the man to display his ID card!"
Rise from the ashes,3,183,Ema,"Well, that sounds pretty much by the book so far."
Rise from the ashes,3,184,Meekins,"Th-that's right, sir! That's what I've been trying to tell you!"
Rise from the ashes,3,185,Phoenix,So you asked Detective Goodman to show his ID card. What did he do?
Rise from the ashes,3,186,Meekins,That's the thing! Suddenly he pointed a knife at me!
Rise from the ashes,3,187,Ema,What...!?
Rise from the ashes,3,188,Meekins,"Sir, I assure you I was as flustered as you are right now! So I whooped and leapt at him!"
Rise from the ashes,3,189,Phoenix,(Detective Goodman pointed a knife at him?)
Rise from the ashes,3,190,Meekins,"""Do unto others before they do unto you""! My father's own words, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,3,191,Ema,Wh-what happened then?
Rise from the ashes,3,192,Meekins,"Well... My eyes, sir... everything went white. When I awoke, I was here."
Rise from the ashes,3,193,Phoenix,(Right...)
Rise from the ashes,3,194,Phoenix,And your hand... that happened when Detective Goodman was stabbed?
Rise from the ashes,3,195,Meekins,"Well! You see, sir, I, er..."
Rise from the ashes,3,196,Ema,Don't you think you should just confess?
Rise from the ashes,3,197,Meekins,"But, sir! Sir! But! There was nothing I could do!"
Rise from the ashes,3,198,Phoenix,"""Nothing you could do""...?"
Rise from the ashes,3,199,Meekins,"Sir, to tell the truth, sir, when it happened... When the detective pointed that knife at me, I just hollered, sir! And the next thing I knew, I was unconscious!"
Rise from the ashes,3,200,Phoenix,The next thing you knew you were... huh?
Rise from the ashes,3,201,Meekins,"Then, when I opened my eyes... I was alone in the evidence room, sir! All alone! Alone, because... Because Detective Goodman had disappeared!!!"
Rise from the ashes,3,202,Ema,What!?
Rise from the ashes,3,203,Meekins,"Then when I looked down, I was gushing blood from my hand, sir! Oh, the shock! Oh, the sorrow, sir! Can you imagine how I felt?"
Rise from the ashes,3,204,Phoenix,(The victim's body... disappeared...?)
Rise from the ashes,3,205,Ema,Hmm... That's some story.
Rise from the ashes,3,206,Ema,"So, Officer Meekins, why was it that they arrested you?"
Rise from the ashes,3,207,Phoenix,"What do you mean, Ema?"
Rise from the ashes,3,208,Ema,"Let's look at what we know. Now, Officer Meekins didn't know Detective Goodman... And the ""victim"" whom he met at the scene of the crime didn't show his ID card."
Rise from the ashes,3,209,Phoenix,"In other words, we have no way of knowing if the victim was really the victim!"
Rise from the ashes,3,210,Ema,"And if this ""body"" just ""disappeared"" from the evidence room... We don't even know if anyone actually died!"
Rise from the ashes,3,211,Meekins,"That's it, sir! That! That's what I wanted to say! That is... I did say something along those lines."
Rise from the ashes,3,212,Ema,Huh? But you still ended up here...?
Rise from the ashes,3,213,Meekins,"They told me that it had to be him, sir. ""On that day, at that time..."" Detective Goodman was definitely in the evidence room."" That's what they said."
Rise from the ashes,3,214,Phoenix,But... you don't remember the events clearly?
Rise from the ashes,3,215,Meekins,No... but the video tape is quite clear.
Rise from the ashes,3,216,Ema,Huh? Video tape...?
Rise from the ashes,3,217,Meekins,"From the security camera. The crime, my crime, the crime I swore to stamp out! It's there! It's me! It's on tape!"
Rise from the ashes,3,218,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,3,219,Ema,...
Rise from the ashes,3,220,Meekins,...
Rise from the ashes,3,221,Ema,And you wait until now to tell us this!?
Rise from the ashes,3,222,Meekins,"I'm sorry, really sorry, sir! I'll hand over my badge! I don't deserve it!"
Rise from the ashes,3,223,Phoenix,"N-no thanks, I have my own. (Well, guess we'd better go check out the crime scene.)"
Rise from the ashes,3,224,Phoenix,"(This place is charge with frantic energy, as always.)"
Rise from the ashes,3,225,Gumshoe,Please!!!
Rise from the ashes,3,226,Ema,Huh? Wasn't that...
Rise from the ashes,3,227,Gumshoe,"One steak lunch, please! Oh, it's you."
Rise from the ashes,3,228,Phoenix,Detective Gumshoe!
Rise from the ashes,3,229,Gumshoe,"Now's no time for chit-chat, pal. I'm a busy man! What I really need is a steak lunch from Lunchland."
Rise from the ashes,3,230,Ema,"Oh... you mean one of these? Actually, it's not for sale..."
Rise from the ashes,3,231,Gumshoe,......
Rise from the ashes,3,232,Phoenix,(I think I just heard the sound of his heart breaking.)
Rise from the ashes,3,233,Gumshoe,Now's no time for despair! We've caught our criminal! Now we just need evidence!
Rise from the ashes,3,234,Phoenix,The criminal... you mean...?
Rise from the ashes,3,235,Gumshoe,"You heard about the stabbing in the Police Department evidence room, pal?"
Rise from the ashes,3,236,Phoenix,On the same day that a detective was killed in the Prosecutor's parking lot... Another detective... was killed at the Police Department!?
Rise from the ashes,3,237,Edgeworth,And the perpetrator? Do you have a suspect?
Rise from the ashes,3,238,Gant,"Well, there was a suspect. Just arrested 'em, in fact."
Rise from the ashes,3,239,Gumshoe,It's the biggest scandal to hit the station in ages! Everything's topsy-turvy.
Rise from the ashes,3,240,Phoenix,"But, Detective Gumshoe, who was it?"
Rise from the ashes,3,241,Gumshoe,"Listen, pal, all I know is I need me a steak lunch, pronto! Standing around here talking isn't going to fill my belly!"
Rise from the ashes,3,242,Ema,W-wait! Don't leave!
Rise from the ashes,3,243,Gumshoe,"If you want to know more, head on down to the detention center, pal. Questioning should be over, so I figure he's down there having a good cry. Later!"
Rise from the ashes,3,244,Ema,He ran off to the evidence room...
Rise from the ashes,3,245,Phoenix,"Well, this investigation is off to a running start."
Rise from the ashes,3,246,Ema,"Ooh, a real crime scene! Let's go take a look!"
Rise from the ashes,3,247,Phoenix,"Wow, everyone looks deadly serious here..."
Rise from the ashes,3,248,Ema,"Well, there was a vicious murder of a detective in this department, after all."
Rise from the ashes,3,249,Phoenix,"Yes, but the same detective was also killed at the same time in the Prosecutor's lot."
Rise from the ashes,3,250,Ema,Ugh... It makes my head hurt.
Rise from the ashes,3,251,Phoenix,"Well, first things first. I want to check out the crime scene here."
Rise from the ashes,3,252,Ema,"Yes, you sound ""dead""-set on investigating! But don't mess up, or we could wind up... dead!"
Rise from the ashes,3,253,Phoenix,"I doubt anyone wants more mysteries or dead bodies around here right now. (But... it doesn't look like anyone's going to help us much, either.)"
Rise from the ashes,3,254,Ema,"H-hey, Mr. Wright! Look who's standing at the Head Detective's desk!"
Rise from the ashes,3,255,Phoenix,(It's Chief Gant!)
Rise from the ashes,3,256,Gant,"Are you sure this is all, hmm? You know what it means if there is anything missing!"
Rise from the ashes,3,257,Chief,"Sir! I'm sure it's most likely totally perfect! We checked the drawers, the lockers, the garbage cans, the coat pockets... the pillowcases, behind the computer monitors, the coffee machine..."
Rise from the ashes,3,258,Gant,"I see. Well, if anything does turn up, you call me right away, deal?"
Rise from the ashes,3,259,Chief,"Y-y-y-yessir!!! We'll scour the place again, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,3,260,Phoenix,(The Head Detective looks a little flustered...)
Rise from the ashes,3,261,Gant,"Ah hah! Wrighto, my boy! How ya been? Swim much?"
Rise from the ashes,3,262,Phoenix,"Oh ho ho, Chief Gant! Reporting for duty, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,3,263,Ema,"Why are you saluting him, Mr. Wright!?"
Rise from the ashes,3,264,Chief,"Ooh, sorry you had to see that."
Rise from the ashes,3,265,Ema,Uh... what exactly did the Chief of Police want you to do?
Rise from the ashes,3,266,Chief,"Well, see over there? That's Goodman's desk. He wanted me to check it for anything that might be a clue... They took away every last piece of garbage in the trash can."
Rise from the ashes,3,267,Ema,"So, nothing belonging to Detective Goodman is still here?"
Rise from the ashes,3,268,Chief,"Of course not! Well, except for this."
Rise from the ashes,3,269,Ema,What!? You kept something!?
Rise from the ashes,3,270,Chief,"Sure, why not? It's not important. He didn't even finish writing it! It's a lost item report but it's only half complete."
Rise from the ashes,3,271,Ema,A lost item? Did Detective Goodman lose something?
Rise from the ashes,3,272,Phoenix,The date on it is February 21. (I'll make a note of that just in case.)
Rise from the ashes,3,273,Phoenix,(I should probably get a quick look around the crime scene...)
Rise from the ashes,3,274,Phoenix,Um... is Edgeworth going to be okay?
Rise from the ashes,3,275,Gant,"Oh, Worthy? Oh, you know, they're doing a little inquiry committee with him."
Rise from the ashes,3,276,Ema,Sounds like an inquisition...!
Rise from the ashes,3,277,Gant,"Yep, well, we've had no end of trouble with the boy since last year..."
Rise from the ashes,3,278,Phoenix,You mean... the incident on Gourd Lake?
Rise from the ashes,3,279,Gant,"It doesn't look good having one of our top people sitting in the defendant's seat. Now, you got someone else found guilty in that case, right, Wrighto?"
Rise from the ashes,3,280,Phoenix,(von Karma...)
Rise from the ashes,3,281,Gant,"A legend he was, undefeated in his forty year career! But in court you fixed it so he was caught for forging evidence..."
Rise from the ashes,3,282,Phoenix,W-wait! I didn't do anything wrong! He did forge evidence.
Rise from the ashes,3,283,Gant,"In any case, the Prosecutor's Office is in a bit of turmoil, you might say. Why, they'd do just about anything to restore their reputation. Now, depending on what that inquiry committee decides... It could be bad for Worthy."
Rise from the ashes,3,284,Ema,Wh-what!?
Rise from the ashes,3,285,Gant,"It's downright odd, I tell you. I mean, it happened at exactly the same time!"
Rise from the ashes,3,286,Phoenix,(The murder at the Prosecutor's Office...)
Rise from the ashes,3,287,Ema,"Scientifically speaking, it's impossible!"
Rise from the ashes,3,288,Gant,"Yes, but that's what the evidence is saying. ""Goodman was stabbed in two locations at the same time!"" That's what it says."
Rise from the ashes,3,289,Phoenix,What evidence is this...?
Rise from the ashes,3,290,Gant,"Now, now, Wrighto, I can't give away all our secrets just like that! And this in particular, well it's a little sensitive... and I can't talk about it."
Rise from the ashes,3,291,Phoenix,(I wasn't expecting much anyway.)
Rise from the ashes,3,292,Gant,"You know, one thing I hate most of all is hiding stuff. Secrets. Can't stand 'em! But you know... It's a full time job just keeping the Head Detective's trap shut!"
Rise from the ashes,3,293,Ema,"Ah, he was the one you were picking on earlier?"
Rise from the ashes,3,294,Gant,Huh? You saw that? Whoops!
Rise from the ashes,3,295,Phoenix,(I wonder what it was that he wanted the Head Detective to do?)
Rise from the ashes,3,296,Ema,Let's see if we can kind of discreetly ask him.
Rise from the ashes,3,297,Phoenix,"Actually, I was wondering if I could ask you a favor?"
Rise from the ashes,3,298,Gant,"Hmm? Well, I never thought the day would come when Wrighto asked me for help!"
Rise from the ashes,3,299,Phoenix,I was wondering if we could investigate the evidence room?
Rise from the ashes,3,300,Gant,"Now, Wrighto..."
Rise from the ashes,3,301,Phoenix,"A-actually, I'm sorry, I d-don't need to investigate after all!"
Rise from the ashes,3,302,Gant,"Wrighto, please, do I look like a selfish man?"
Rise from the ashes,3,303,Phoenix,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,3,304,Gant,"Heck, if anyone asked me ""sir, can I borrow $50?"" I'd give them $50, no problem. So, go ahead! Investigate that room to your heart's content! Knock yourself out!"
Rise from the ashes,3,305,Ema,"It just goes to show, you never know until you ask!"
Rise from the ashes,3,306,Gant,"And for you, here, you can borrow this."
Rise from the ashes,3,307,Ema,"Huh... hey! This is a detective's ID card, isn't it?"
Rise from the ashes,3,308,Gant,"That's a special card for guests, so don't lose it."
Rise from the ashes,3,309,Ema,Y-yessir! It's an honor!
Rise from the ashes,3,310,Gant,"You just run along and do your best, now. Later, folks!"
Rise from the ashes,3,311,Ema,"Heh heh! It looks pretty cool on my lapel, doesn't it? Just think, a real ID!"
Rise from the ashes,3,312,Phoenix,You seem... happy.
Rise from the ashes,3,313,Ema,"Yes, sir! Because, sir, we get to go into the evidence room now, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,3,314,Phoenix,(I think this place is a bad influence on the girl.)
Rise from the ashes,3,315,Phoenix,What's with the decor in this place? It's very... eccentric.
Rise from the ashes,3,316,Ema,"According to the pamphlet, this is the guard station for the evidence room."
Rise from the ashes,3,317,Phoenix,"So, beyond that door is the evidence room... the scene of the crime?"
Rise from the ashes,3,318,Ema,It sure seems that way... Oh. Ohhh...
Rise from the ashes,3,319,Phoenix,What's wrong?
Rise from the ashes,3,320,Ema,It's those cacti! They're so prickly... so imposing! It's hard to think straight.
Rise from the ashes,3,321,Phoenix,"(If you can't handle the cacti, stay out of the desert...) What I want to know is, if this is a guard station, where is the guard?"
Rise from the ashes,3,322,Ema,I have a feeling I know who this guard is already...
Rise from the ashes,3,323,Phoenix,The evidence room is beyond that door.
Rise from the ashes,3,324,Ema,And we have the ID card from Chief Gant! Let's just walk in! ... It won't open.
Rise from the ashes,3,325,Phoenix,"Ah hah! The card reader is turned off, see?"
Rise from the ashes,3,326,Ema,What is that security guard thinking?
Rise from the ashes,3,327,Marshall,"Howdy, pardners. Well, well, what's made my bambina's skies so gray?"
Rise from the ashes,3,328,Phoenix,"O-Officer Marshall! (Somehow, I knew...)"
Rise from the ashes,3,329,Marshall,"What's that ""somehow I knew"" look for? As you may have surmised, this here's my saloon."
Rise from the ashes,3,330,Ema,Um... we're here to investigate the crime scene.
Rise from the ashes,3,331,Marshall,... Yeehaw! That card you got there on your chest. That's better than a sheriff's badge in these parts.
Rise from the ashes,3,332,Ema,Y-yeehaw?
Rise from the ashes,3,333,Marshall,"Well, what ya standin' there for? Get along, little dogies. The crime scene's a waiting!"
Rise from the ashes,3,334,_,*beep*
Rise from the ashes,3,335,Phoenix,"(Looks like the card reader's on again.) While we're here, I was wondering if we could ask you some questions?"
Rise from the ashes,3,336,Marshall,"Sorry, cowboy, but I got no mind to tangle with you hombres."
Rise from the ashes,3,337,Phoenix,"You're... busy, then?"
Rise from the ashes,3,338,Marshall,Did I say that? I only said I didn't wish to speak with you.
Rise from the ashes,3,339,Phoenix,"(Actually, you said you had ""no mind to tangle with us hombres."")"
Rise from the ashes,3,340,Ema,"Um, I was wondering if we could talk to you..."
Rise from the ashes,3,341,Marshall,"Sorry, bambina. But I'm off to roam the lands, like a tumbleweed on the wide prairie. Like a gunslinger loading his six-shooter, I say a little prayer. GRROOOOORRK"
Rise from the ashes,3,342,Ema,"What was that all about, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,3,343,Phoenix,I think he was just too hungry to talk.
Rise from the ashes,3,344,Ema,You're just saying that because his stomach was growling! You have no idea what he was talking about either!
Rise from the ashes,3,345,Phoenix,"(Well, in any case, we need to get cracking on this investigation, pronto!)"
Rise from the ashes,3,346,Marshall,......... That smell... Ah! Reminds me of Texas!
Rise from the ashes,3,347,Ema,"So, Officer Marshall... You're from Texas?"
Rise from the ashes,3,348,Marshall,"No, I just saw a special on television the other day. Is this from my baby?"
Rise from the ashes,3,349,Ema,"Uh, yeah, Ms. Starr..."
Rise from the ashes,3,350,Marshall,Wh-what's this!?
Rise from the ashes,3,351,Ema,What? What's wrong?
Rise from the ashes,3,352,Marshall,A filet steak lunch! I see... I see!
Rise from the ashes,3,353,Ema,I don't see. I wonder what it means?
Rise from the ashes,3,354,Marshall,"Alright, bambina. You win. Ask mmph mmph munch munch Anything mmph munch snack."
Rise from the ashes,3,355,Phoenix,"(Finally, it seems like...)"
Rise from the ashes,3,356,Ema,He's willing to talk!
Rise from the ashes,3,357,Ema,"Officer Marshall, you're in charge of security for the evidence room, right?"
Rise from the ashes,3,358,Marshall,"You got good eyes, pardner. It's an easy job, and I'm grateful for it."
Rise from the ashes,3,359,Phoenix,"Actually, Officer Meekins at the detention center told us."
Rise from the ashes,3,360,Marshall,"Ah, that poor little dogie? Poor guy, I keep getting his name wrong and calling him ""Meekly."""
Rise from the ashes,3,361,Phoenix,"He told us something. He said that, when the stabbing occurred... you weren't at your station."
Rise from the ashes,3,362,Marshall,"... Well, maybe I shouldn't be telling you this... But since I got demoted from detective two years ago... Well, it might not look it, but I lost my fire for the job, you know?"
Rise from the ashes,3,363,Ema,So... what were you doing around 5:15 when the murder took place?
Rise from the ashes,3,364,Marshall,"Well... I reckon I was galloping down the highway on the back of my steed, Zippy."
Rise from the ashes,3,365,Ema,"Note: he was riding down the highway on his horse named ""Zippy."""
Rise from the ashes,3,366,Marshall,"There's no need for people here, anyhow. These newfangled machines do a bang-up job of keeping an eye on the place."
Rise from the ashes,3,367,Phoenix,You mean the security camera system?
Rise from the ashes,3,368,Marshall,"I don't take to machines much. Kinda like that stewed broccoli they sneak in next to your steak, you know?"
Rise from the ashes,3,369,Ema,Ms. Starr told us something... She said that you were a detective until two years ago.
Rise from the ashes,3,370,Marshall,It was always my dream to be a rawhide wrangler on the scene of the crime... That's all gone now... Like a drinking hole in a prairie fire.
Rise from the ashes,3,371,Ema,"You're still investigating the SL-9 Incident with Ms. Starr, aren't you?"
Rise from the ashes,3,372,Marshall,"That was my case... It's all ""solved"" on the record books. But it smells like a bad game of poker. I can't let it go... That's all there is to it."
Rise from the ashes,3,373,Ema,"What kind of case was it, anyway? We've heard the name so many times, but no one tells us what actually happened."
Rise from the ashes,3,374,Marshall,"... There are some things you're better off not knowing, Bambina. Anyway, that case is officially dead as of two days ago."
Rise from the ashes,3,375,Phoenix,Two days ago... the day of our case!
Rise from the ashes,3,376,Marshall,That's right... The evidence transferals.
Rise from the ashes,3,377,Phoenix,"(Edgeworth was talking about the transferals, too.)"
Rise from the ashes,3,378,Marshall,I know what maybe two of the machines in here do.
Rise from the ashes,3,379,Ema,O-only two of them? There must be a dozen!
Rise from the ashes,3,380,Marshall,"Like I said, bambina, Me and machines, well... I like them about as much as I like stewed cauliflower with my steaks. The easiest ones to understand are these here security cameras."
Rise from the ashes,3,381,Phoenix,(Those are the ones that Officer Meekins mentioned.)
Rise from the ashes,3,382,Marshall,"If nothing happens, the tapes are automatically erased every few hours."
Rise from the ashes,3,383,Ema,"And Officer Meekins and Detective Goodman, are they on one of those tapes?"
Rise from the ashes,3,384,Marshall,I reckon they might be.
Rise from the ashes,3,385,Phoenix,"(You're the security guard and you ""reckon""!?)"
Rise from the ashes,3,386,Marshall,One more thing. When you go into the evidence room... You need an ID card.
Rise from the ashes,3,387,Phoenix,(Thus the card reader by the door.)
Rise from the ashes,3,388,Marshall,The card reader leaves a record of every ID card passed through.
Rise from the ashes,3,389,Phoenix,(So this is the ID card record...)
Rise from the ashes,3,390,Ema,Hey! I've seen that somewhere before!
Rise from the ashes,3,391,Marshall,"Sorry, Bambina. I can't show you more than that."
Rise from the ashes,3,392,Ema,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,3,393,Marshall,"I haven't heard whether this is related to the case, yet."
Rise from the ashes,3,394,Ema,Mr. Wright! I saw a number on that record just now! I've seen that number before!
Rise from the ashes,3,395,Phoenix,(Maybe there's some way I can prove that record is tied to the stabbing.)
Rise from the ashes,3,396,Phoenix,"Sorry, but could you explain what this whole ""transferal"" thing is about?"
Rise from the ashes,3,397,Marshall,"We keep only evidence from solved cases in this room. They're kept here under the presiding detective's supervision for two years. So we can re-investigate them if it turns out there was a mistake, see?"
Rise from the ashes,3,398,Phoenix,"So, what happens to the evidence after two years?"
Rise from the ashes,3,399,Marshall,"It goes to sleep forever in the underground vault at the Police Station. That's what we call ""transferal."" We do it every February."
Rise from the ashes,3,400,Ema,I see now...
Rise from the ashes,3,401,Marshall,"""Transferal"" is like a funeral for old cases. Two years after a case is solved... it's closed forever. Dead. Never to be reopened again. Never to be reinvestigated."
Rise from the ashes,3,402,Phoenix,(And that happened to SL-9 two days ago...)
Rise from the ashes,3,403,Ema,See this? This is the victim's ID card.
Rise from the ashes,3,404,Marshall,"Ah, the one that was on the ground in the parking lot?"
Rise from the ashes,3,405,Phoenix,"The number on this is... ""5842189."""
Rise from the ashes,3,406,Ema,"Officer Marshall! Show us the ID number on that ID card record! Look, the fourth number! It's a perfect match!"
Rise from the ashes,3,407,Phoenix,It was used at... 5:14. Right before the stabbing!
Rise from the ashes,3,408,Marshall,"What's more, there's only one of them cards in the world!"
Rise from the ashes,3,409,Ema,"So, when the incident occurred, Detective Goodman was in the evidence room!"
Rise from the ashes,3,410,Phoenix,"(But wait, what did Officer Meekins say?)"
Rise from the ashes,3,411,Meekins,"Sir, I entered the evidence room, and asked the man to display his ID card!"
Rise from the ashes,3,412,Phoenix,So you asked Detective Goodman to show his ID card. What did he do?
Rise from the ashes,3,413,Meekins,That's the thing! Suddenly he pointed a knife at me!
Rise from the ashes,3,414,Phoenix,(If he had his ID card then... Why would he have pointed a knife at Officer Meekins?)
Rise from the ashes,3,415,Marshall,"Alright, compadre, you win. I guess I can give you this ID card record."
Rise from the ashes,3,416,Phoenix,(I've got an idea... Maybe I should show this list to other people with IDs here...)
Rise from the ashes,3,417,Phoenix,(It's quiet... the investigation must be over here.)
Rise from the ashes,3,418,Ema,So this is the evidence room? It really is kind of like a graveyard.
Rise from the ashes,3,419,Phoenix,Graveyards are supposed to have grass and trees. This feels more like a morgue.
Rise from the ashes,3,420,Ema,"N-nice try, M-Mr. Wright. Y-you can't scare me! Eeeeeeek!"
Rise from the ashes,3,421,Gumshoe,Whoooooah!
Rise from the ashes,3,422,Ema,"S-sorry, I thought you were a ghost!"
Rise from the ashes,3,423,Gumshoe,"I wouldn't recommend going around smacking ghosts on the head, pal. So, is it true what I heard?"
Rise from the ashes,3,424,Gant,"Wrighto, please, do I look like a selfish man? Heck, if anyone asked me ""sir, can I borrow $50?"" I'd give them $50, no problem. So, go ahead! Investigate that room to your heart's desire! Knock yourself out!"
Rise from the ashes,3,425,Phoenix,"Yeah, it's true."
Rise from the ashes,3,426,Gumshoe,"So, Chief of Police Gant... will loan anyone 50 bucks? Even me!?"
Rise from the ashes,3,427,Ema,"Oh, so that's what you were talking about..."
Rise from the ashes,3,428,Gumshoe,"Actually, I was put in charge of the investigation for today."
Rise from the ashes,3,429,Phoenix,Just for today?
Rise from the ashes,3,430,Ema,Boss for a day...
Rise from the ashes,3,431,Gumshoe,But guess what!? You got permission from the Chief... So now you're boss for a day!
Rise from the ashes,3,432,Phoenix,"(Gee, thanks...)"
Rise from the ashes,3,433,Gumshoe,"First of all, you'll want to have this."
Rise from the ashes,3,434,Ema,"So, Detective Gumshoe, you're boss for the day?"
Rise from the ashes,3,435,Gumshoe,"That's right! It's an honor! After all, the murder took place right here, in the Police Department!"
Rise from the ashes,3,436,Ema,"But, if you're boss... why are you all alone!? Where are your underlings?"
Rise from the ashes,3,437,Gumshoe,... They're using our findings from yesterday's investigation to prepare for the trial.
Rise from the ashes,3,438,Phoenix,"(In other words, Detective Gumshoe got kicked out of the investigation again...)"
Rise from the ashes,3,439,Gumshoe,"I'm adamant, though! I'm going to take control and put this case to rest! And in my own evidence locker, pal!"
Rise from the ashes,3,440,Phoenix,"You have a locker in here, too, Detective Gumshoe?"
Rise from the ashes,3,441,Gumshoe,"Hah hah, of course! I am a detective, after all. They gave me a locker that only I can open, pal!"
Rise from the ashes,3,442,Ema,"""Only you can open""...?"
Rise from the ashes,3,443,Gumshoe,This place is more high-tech than you might think. Every locker is fixed so that only one detective can open it.
Rise from the ashes,3,444,Phoenix,Using this ID card?
Rise from the ashes,3,445,Gumshoe,"Well, that's the thing, pal. ID cards can be lost. Why, I'm on my third card since entering the force already."
Rise from the ashes,3,446,Ema,That sounds like a lot.
Rise from the ashes,3,447,Gumshoe,"Yes, but even I can't lose my own right hand!"
Rise from the ashes,3,448,Ema,"""Right hand""...? Oh! You mean, your fingerprint?"
Rise from the ashes,3,449,Gumshoe,"Exactly, pal! The lock for each locker is coded with a fingerprint! And that's the only locker we can open."
Rise from the ashes,3,450,Ema,"Funny, they look like normal lockers..."
Rise from the ashes,3,451,Gumshoe,"These are the latest model! There's a trick to the handles, see?"
Rise from the ashes,3,452,Ema,The handles?
Rise from the ashes,3,453,Gumshoe,"On the other side of the handles is a sensor, and if the wrong person touches it..."
Rise from the ashes,3,454,Ema,Bzzzap! You get a shock!
Rise from the ashes,3,455,Gumshoe,"If that's what happened, my hand would be black and smoking every day! In any case, the locks aren't that obvious. There's even some people in the force that don't know about the fingerprint locks!"
Rise from the ashes,3,456,Gumshoe,"I'll always believe in Mr. Edgeworth, no matter what happens."
Rise from the ashes,3,457,Ema,"So... Mr. Edgeworth is with the inquiry committee now, right?"
Rise from the ashes,3,458,Gumshoe,They're trying to figure out who's responsible for the mess-up in court today.
Rise from the ashes,3,459,Phoenix,I see...
Rise from the ashes,3,460,Gumshoe,"I guess this is what you call ""fate."" Mr. Edgeworth just can't get away from that case..."
Rise from the ashes,3,461,Phoenix,That case...?
Rise from the ashes,3,462,Gumshoe,"Yeah, that case! The SL-9 Incident, of course! That was the beginning of the end for Mr. Edgeworth."
Rise from the ashes,3,463,Phoenix,(Maybe we can get him to tell us more about the case...)
Rise from the ashes,3,464,Gumshoe,Detective Goodman's note... and that switchblade knife. I bet Edgeworth was the most surprised of anyone.
Rise from the ashes,3,465,Phoenix,Because of the SL-9 connection?
Rise from the ashes,3,466,Gumshoe,"That was Mr. Edgeworth's first big case you know, two years ago. That was the first time the world knew Edgeworth was a man to be feared!"
Rise from the ashes,3,467,Phoenix,"But, why would evidence from that case turn up now?"
Rise from the ashes,3,468,Gumshoe,"I guess it's not over, pal. Maybe there are some loose ends left on that case..."
Rise from the ashes,3,469,Gumshoe,"Now that was a bloody, violent case."
Rise from the ashes,3,470,Phoenix,Violent... so it was a murder?
Rise from the ashes,3,471,Gumshoe,A serial killing!
Rise from the ashes,3,472,Phoenix,(A serial killing... Maybe I don't want to get involved in this after all.)
Rise from the ashes,3,473,Gumshoe,"But the killer made a mistake, and Mr. Edgeworth built his case around that to nab him."
Rise from the ashes,3,474,Ema,And this was two years ago?
Rise from the ashes,3,475,Gumshoe,That put Mr. Edgeworth right in the spotlight... and started the rumor mill.
Rise from the ashes,3,476,Phoenix,Rumors... (About forged evidence?)
Rise from the ashes,3,477,Gumshoe,"It was supposed to be all cleaned up with the ""transferal"" the other day. It was the last job he ever did... Detective Goodman, that is."
Rise from the ashes,3,478,Ema,Huh? What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,3,479,Gumshoe,"Detective Goodman was the detective in charge of the SL-9 Incident, see."
Rise from the ashes,3,480,Ema,"So, so... That switchblade knife..."
Rise from the ashes,3,481,Phoenix,The victim took the knife out of the evidence locker himself?
Rise from the ashes,3,482,Phoenix,Could you take a look at this? This is the ID card of the person who came here on the day of the stabbing.
Rise from the ashes,3,483,Gumshoe,"Ah, I heard the rumors. So it was Goodman who came in here at the time of the murder... Whoooooooooah!!!"
Rise from the ashes,3,484,Ema,Wh-what is it?
Rise from the ashes,3,485,Gumshoe,Th-th-th-th-th-th! That second number...
Rise from the ashes,3,486,Phoenix,"It's not your ID number is it, Detective Gumshoe?"
Rise from the ashes,3,487,Gumshoe,Mr. Edgeworth!
Rise from the ashes,3,488,Ema,What...?
Rise from the ashes,3,489,Gumshoe,The second number on this list... belongs to Mr. Edgeworth!
Rise from the ashes,3,490,Ema,What... Whaaaaaaaaat!?
Rise from the ashes,3,491,Phoenix,(Why would Edgeworth have come to the evidence room!?)
Rise from the ashes,3,492,Ema,Someone left a glove here... but only one.
Rise from the ashes,3,493,Phoenix,"Detective Gumshoe, maybe?"
Rise from the ashes,3,494,Gumshoe,"There you go, pal, making me out to be some kind of absent-minded detective! That's evidence from ""the"" case, you know."
Rise from the ashes,3,495,Phoenix,You mean SL-9? (It does have a tag on it...)
Rise from the ashes,3,496,Ema,"Wow, someone must have broken something big to make all these pieces."
Rise from the ashes,3,497,Phoenix,"Detective Gumshoe, perhaps?"
Rise from the ashes,3,498,Gumshoe,"There you go, pal, making me out to be some kind of hooligan! That's apparently from ""the"" case."
Rise from the ashes,3,499,Ema,"""The"" case?"
Rise from the ashes,3,500,Gumshoe,"The SL-9 Incident, pal. See the sticker on one of the pieces there?"
Rise from the ashes,3,501,Phoenix,(Another piece of SL-9 evidence...)
Rise from the ashes,3,502,Phoenix,I wonder what shape these pieces were in before whatever it was broke?
Rise from the ashes,3,503,Ema,You want to try to put it back together?
Rise from the ashes,3,504,Gumshoe,"Hah! Good luck, pal. That's no job for amateurs. Why, I spent a good three hours on that before I had to give up!"
Rise from the ashes,3,505,Ema,That's why I always carry around a tube of glue!
Rise from the ashes,3,506,Phoenix,"(Well, this piece looks like the bottom. Let's try putting the rest in place!)"
Rise from the ashes,3,507,Ema,"H-huh? Well, I think we did it. But some of the pieces are missing."
Rise from the ashes,3,508,Gumshoe,That only took me two minutes to do! The problem is finishing it!
Rise from the ashes,3,509,Ema,Were some pieces stolen?
Rise from the ashes,3,510,Phoenix,I bet they were missing to begin with.
Rise from the ashes,3,511,Gumshoe,Still... It doesn't look like the most stable kind of jar.
Rise from the ashes,3,512,Ema,I kind of understand how it got broken.
Rise from the ashes,3,513,Ema,...! Why am I getting a reaction here?
Rise from the ashes,3,514,Phoenix,There's no reason for the murderer to touch this spot if he fled out the door. (This just might be something significant!)
Rise from the ashes,3,515,Gumshoe,"Hey... That's some pretty amazing stuff you got there, pal!"
Rise from the ashes,3,516,Ema,"What, this? It's called ""Luminol Testing Fluid""!"
Rise from the ashes,3,517,Gumshoe,Where'd you get your hands on that!?
Rise from the ashes,3,518,Ema,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,3,519,Gumshoe,I'd like to get some too! I'll just borrow 50 bucks from the Chief!
Rise from the ashes,3,520,Phoenix,"Where do you get this, Ema?"
Rise from the ashes,3,521,Ema,I always buy it by mail order.
Rise from the ashes,3,522,Phoenix,"(Well, I'd better jot this down on the floor plans.)"
Rise from the ashes,3,523,Ema,I knew it! This is someone's right handprint!
Rise from the ashes,3,524,Gumshoe,WHAAAAAAT!!?
Rise from the ashes,3,525,Phoenix,"What's the matter, Detective? Th-this locker... It's mine!"
Rise from the ashes,3,526,Ema,It's yours?
Rise from the ashes,3,527,Gumshoe,"Please! You have to help me... When they come to take me away... Promise you'll testify that I wouldn't harm a fly! You'll do that for me, won't you, pals!?"
Rise from the ashes,3,528,Phoenix,(This is an important clue! I'll jot it down on the floor plans...)
Rise from the ashes,3,529,Gumshoe,"I'm counting on you guys! Believe me, you can't trust the police!"
Rise from the ashes,3,530,Ema,What? But you're a detective!
Rise from the ashes,3,531,Phoenix,"There must have been a massive amount of blood here. (I've never seen so much before...) I'm not a professional. What's your opinion, Detective?"
Rise from the ashes,3,532,Gumshoe,Hmm... Pale blue blood... Maybe Detective Goodman... was actually an alien?
Rise from the ashes,3,533,Ema,This proves that something really happened in front of this locker.
Rise from the ashes,3,534,Phoenix,I'll make a note of it on the floor plans.
Rise from the ashes,3,535,Gumshoe,"Hey! If you didn't want my opinion, you shouldn't have asked!"
Rise from the ashes,3,536,Gumshoe,"Hey, pal, look at the time!!"
Rise from the ashes,3,537,Phoenix,Was there something you needed to be going to?
Rise from the ashes,3,538,Gumshoe,"It's just that Mr. Edgeworth's inquiry committee should be letting out soon. I'm going to go give them my report for the day. It might help, you know..."
Rise from the ashes,3,539,Ema,R-report? You mean the note written on the back of that flyer?
Rise from the ashes,3,540,Phoenix,"The one that says nothing but ""No problems""!?"
Rise from the ashes,3,541,Gumshoe,"Hey, it's Mr. Edgeworth we're talking about! I'm sure he can use a report like this. I believe in him!"
Rise from the ashes,3,542,Phoenix,(Who needs enemies when you've got friends like Detective Gumshoe..)
Rise from the ashes,3,543,Gumshoe,"I'm off, pal! Later!"
Rise from the ashes,3,544,Phoenix,"(I should probably see what Edgeworth has to say, too.)"
Rise from the ashes,3,545,Bellboy,"Ah, guests! My apologies."
Rise from the ashes,3,546,Phoenix,Oh! It's you!
Rise from the ashes,3,547,Bellboy,Have we met somewhere...?
Rise from the ashes,3,548,Phoenix,Huh!?
Rise from the ashes,3,549,Bellboy,Mr. Edgeworth! I beg your leave. So long!
Rise from the ashes,3,550,Phoenix,(Is Edgeworth here...?)
Rise from the ashes,3,551,Ema,"There, standing by the window, a teacup in his hand!"
Rise from the ashes,3,552,Edgeworth,"Ah, it's you."
Rise from the ashes,3,553,Phoenix,(He has the hotel bring him tea service!?)
Rise from the ashes,3,554,Ema,Mr. Edgeworth... you're back from the District Prosecutor's Office inquiry?
Rise from the ashes,3,555,Edgeworth,Precisely.
Rise from the ashes,3,556,Phoenix,"By the way, Detective Gumshoe was looking for you."
Rise from the ashes,3,557,Edgeworth,"Oh yes... He brought me some information, it seems."
Rise from the ashes,3,558,Ema,Really? Was it helpful?
Rise from the ashes,3,559,Edgeworth,"Apparently, a new French restaurant is opening near here. I think he was trying to console me, somehow."
Rise from the ashes,3,560,Phoenix,"(Er, I think the report is on the other side, Edgeworth...)"
Rise from the ashes,3,561,Ema,Poor Mr. Edgeworth... I think this whole thing is really taking a toll on him.
Rise from the ashes,3,562,Phoenix,"So, how did the inquiry committee go?"
Rise from the ashes,3,563,Edgeworth,"Actually, they decided to treat this not as a case of concealing evidence... But as a communications error during the investigation."
Rise from the ashes,3,564,Ema,"""Concealing evidence""...?"
Rise from the ashes,3,565,Edgeworth,"Yes. Apparently, there are some who believe... that I concealed evidence. They gave me a warning. ""You were lucky this time... again."""
Rise from the ashes,3,566,Phoenix,"""Again""...?"
Rise from the ashes,3,567,Edgeworth,I've heard them say that so many times. Ever since that case two years ago...
Rise from the ashes,3,568,Phoenix,Are you okay for the trial tomorrow?
Rise from the ashes,3,569,Edgeworth,"Well, I'm still the presiding prosecuting attorney. However..."
Rise from the ashes,3,570,Phoenix,Something happened?
Rise from the ashes,3,571,Edgeworth,They gave control of the investigation over to the Police Department.
Rise from the ashes,3,572,Ema,The Police Department!
Rise from the ashes,3,573,Edgeworth,Yes. Any further investigation for this case will be directed by the Chief of Police Gant. I can do nothing but wait for his results...
Rise from the ashes,3,574,Phoenix,I... see.
Rise from the ashes,3,575,Edgeworth,"Why, I ask you? Why!? All along, I've done only what I believe is right. I have nothing to be ashamed of! But still..."
Rise from the ashes,3,576,Phoenix,"(Wow, I've never seen him this out of sorts...)"
Rise from the ashes,3,577,Edgeworth,"... I know you. You've probably got a hold of some information already, right?"
Rise from the ashes,3,578,Phoenix,"It all has to do with that case you were on... the SL-9 Incident. And some ""dark suspicion"" you were wrapped up in."
Rise from the ashes,3,579,Edgeworth,"You are the man who revived the worst memory of my life, as I recall. I figured I'd be telling you about this sooner or later."
Rise from the ashes,3,580,Phoenix,"(A bad memory... he's talking about the murder in the elevator...) Okay, Edgeworth. Why don't you tell me about it. Tell me the truth."
Rise from the ashes,3,581,Edgeworth,The SL-9 Incident was a heinous serial killing case. The head of investigation was the Deputy Chief of Police at the time... Damon Gant.
Rise from the ashes,3,582,Phoenix,(That wacky old coot was involved in the case two years ago too then...)
Rise from the ashes,3,583,Edgeworth,"He was the best we had, and it was my first time working with him... I was nervous."
Rise from the ashes,3,584,Ema,"Wow, you get nervous, too, Mr. Edgeworth?"
Rise from the ashes,3,585,Phoenix,(What I want to know is why was a Deputy Chief of Police on the investigation?)
Rise from the ashes,3,586,Edgeworth,"In truth, I used slightly more... extreme methods than normal. We were dealing with a vicious murderer. If I let him go, the blood would be on my hands. We won our guilty verdict, and the killer was executed."
Rise from the ashes,3,587,Phoenix,"Wait, you didn't..."
Rise from the ashes,3,588,Edgeworth,"Of course not! I didn't touch the evidence. Yes, I will do anything in my power to win a trial. However... I do have a code, and I follow it faithfully."
Rise from the ashes,3,589,Phoenix,"Oh, right! I'd better check this now..."
Rise from the ashes,3,590,Edgeworth,"As I was saying, I... ! What's this? A record of ID card usage?"
Rise from the ashes,3,591,Phoenix,"Edgeworth, you went into the evidence room that day, didn't you? Just before the incident occurred, no less."
Rise from the ashes,3,592,Edgeworth,"Yes, that's true."
Rise from the ashes,3,593,Ema,"W-why, Mr. Edgeworth?"
Rise from the ashes,3,594,Edgeworth,Please don't look at me like that. I was asked to go. By Chief Gant no less.
Rise from the ashes,3,595,Ema,The Chief of Police...?
Rise from the ashes,3,596,Edgeworth,He wanted evidence for a case that wrapped up half a year ago. He told me he wanted me to keep it here in the Prosecutor's Office.
Rise from the ashes,3,597,Phoenix,"But... it was solved, right? It would have to be if the evidence was already filed..."
Rise from the ashes,3,598,Edgeworth,"The Chief is never one to explain himself. In any case, on the day of the stabbings, I brought this back here."
Rise from the ashes,3,599,Ema,Can I ask what kind of case it was?
Rise from the ashes,3,600,Edgeworth,I... can't say. It really has nothing to do with the current case.
Rise from the ashes,3,601,Phoenix,(Now I'm curious about this other case. I'd better make a note of it.)
Rise from the ashes,3,602,Edgeworth,Stubborn as always. I told you this has nothing to do with the current case.
Rise from the ashes,3,603,Edgeworth,"By the way, Ema. The Chief Prosecutor wanted to know something..."
Rise from the ashes,3,604,Ema,M-my sister? What?
Rise from the ashes,3,605,Edgeworth,You still working on that scientific investigation?
Rise from the ashes,3,606,Ema,"Huh? Y-yes! Of course! Why, just today Mr. Wright and I were using this..."
Rise from the ashes,3,607,Edgeworth,Luminol testing fluid... Hm? Well then... You might have use for this.
Rise from the ashes,3,608,Ema,Aluminum powder for taking fingerprints!
Rise from the ashes,3,609,Edgeworth,It's been chemically treated for better adhesion.
Rise from the ashes,3,610,Ema,"F-for me? Are you sure? We are the ""enemy"" you know."
Rise from the ashes,3,611,Edgeworth,I've no say in today's investigation... do as you will.
Rise from the ashes,3,612,Phoenix,Edgeworth... I'm really--
Rise from the ashes,3,613,Edgeworth,"No need to thank me. Here, take your powder and these fingerprint files for everyone involved."
Rise from the ashes,3,614,Phoenix,"I, uh, th-thanks! (How about giving these to Detective Gumshoe as well!?)"
Rise from the ashes,3,615,Ema,"Well, let's get going! One last investigation!"
Rise from the ashes,3,616,Phoenix,Right! (I do seem to remember seeing a suspicious handprint somewhere...)
Rise from the ashes,3,617,Phoenix,(Our investigation turned up a suspicious handprint.)
Rise from the ashes,3,618,Ema,"Here, in this blood on the detective's evidence locker."
Rise from the ashes,3,619,Phoenix,Let's use the secret weapon we just borrowed!
Rise from the ashes,3,620,Ema,Right. Let's get started! First... choose a finger.
Rise from the ashes,3,621,Phoenix,A finger...?
Rise from the ashes,3,622,Ema,Each finger leaves behind a slightly different imprint. So let's choose the finger that will have left behind the clearest print!
Rise from the ashes,3,623,Phoenix,I really can't tell the difference at a glance...
Rise from the ashes,3,624,Ema,Quit procrastinating and choose a finger!
Rise from the ashes,3,625,Ema,Okay. Now it's time to check for prints! Let me show you how it's done.
Rise from the ashes,3,626,Phoenix,(Ema's starting to get that sparkle in her eyes...)
Rise from the ashes,3,627,Ema,"First, we sprinkle the aluminum powder around."
Rise from the ashes,3,628,Phoenix,Huh? How do you do that?
Rise from the ashes,3,629,Ema,Just touch the screen... See?
Rise from the ashes,3,630,Phoenix,Ah... it looks like that did the trick.
Rise from the ashes,3,631,Ema,The aluminum powder adheres completely to the print. Once the powder is well spread... just blow away the excess.
Rise from the ashes,3,632,Phoenix,Huh? How do I do that?
Rise from the ashes,3,633,Ema,You just blow With your breath. Imagine you're blowing out the candles on a birthday cake. See?
Rise from the ashes,3,634,Phoenix,Wow... that looks like fun! (It might take some getting used to though...)
Rise from the ashes,3,635,Ema,"It's fine! It won't go up your nose or anything. You just pour the powder on thick, and blow away the extra! Those are the basics of fingerprinting, Mr. Wright!"
Rise from the ashes,3,636,Phoenix,(I guess I'd better give it a try...)
Rise from the ashes,3,637,Ema,Aha! You did it! You found one!
Rise from the ashes,3,638,Phoenix,But... this looks nothing like a fingerprint.
Rise from the ashes,3,639,Ema,"Hmm... now that you mention it, I guess it doesn't..."
Rise from the ashes,3,640,Phoenix,What does it mean?
Rise from the ashes,3,641,Ema,It think it means... we're out of luck.
Rise from the ashes,3,642,Phoenix,Out of luck...?
Rise from the ashes,3,643,Ema,The person who left this handprint must have worn gloves.
Rise from the ashes,3,644,Phoenix,... Don't tell me we've been wasting out time here!
Rise from the ashes,3,645,Ema,"Hey, calm down. That's just the way it goes sometimes with scientific investigations. But... it does seem a shame. While we're at it, why don't we look for other prints?"
Rise from the ashes,3,646,Phoenix,Other prints...?
Rise from the ashes,3,647,Ema,Looking at the locker door again closely...
Rise from the ashes,3,648,Ema,it seems like there are fingerprints outside the bloody handprint as well. Let's see if we can find a clear print!
Rise from the ashes,3,649,Phoenix,(Hmm... fingerprints outside the blood...)
Rise from the ashes,3,650,Ema,Yay! A print so clear it's dazzling!
Rise from the ashes,3,651,Phoenix,D-dazzling...?
Rise from the ashes,3,652,Ema,"Anyway, this print took a lot of effort to find. Let's match it up right away!"
Rise from the ashes,3,653,Phoenix,So we're not over yet? This is quite a process...
Rise from the ashes,3,654,Ema,"Well, there's no point in finding a fingerprint... and not knowing who the owner is, right?"
Rise from the ashes,3,655,Phoenix,(I guess she's right...)
Rise from the ashes,3,656,Ema,Look at the fingerprint data we got from Mr. Edgeworth... and point out the person you think left these prints!
Rise from the ashes,3,657,Phoenix,Huh? How am I supposed to know who it was?
Rise from the ashes,3,658,Ema,"I could make a pretty good guess. The bloody handprint and the fingerprints are in different places right? That means that the prints probably don't have anything to do with our case. So, whose fingerprints would we most likely find on this evidence locker?"
Rise from the ashes,3,659,_,Comparing... Comparison complete. Match found.
Rise from the ashes,3,660,Ema,Ah hah! So these prints belonged to Detective Gumshoe!
Rise from the ashes,3,661,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,3,662,Ema,"Something wrong, Mr. Wright? You gave me this ""so what?"" look."
Rise from the ashes,3,663,Phoenix,"I guess that's probably because I was thinking ""so what?"""
Rise from the ashes,3,664,Ema,"Okay, so we came up with nothing this time, but there's always next time! Sometimes you hit, sometimes you miss! You gotta roll with the punches, Mr. Wright!"
Rise from the ashes,3,665,Phoenix,Thanks for the sympathy. (Wait... If I remember correctly... there was one other handprint in this room. Let's check it out!)
Rise from the ashes,3,666,Phoenix,"This is where we got a luminol fluid reaction, right?"
Rise from the ashes,3,667,Ema,Right! There was a handprint here! Okay! Want to try using this?
Rise from the ashes,3,668,Phoenix,(There go her eyes sparkling again...)
Rise from the ashes,3,669,Phoenix,"Okay, let's check for prints!"
Rise from the ashes,3,670,Ema,That's the spirit! Oh! But I have to warn you about something first.
Rise from the ashes,3,671,Phoenix,What?
Rise from the ashes,3,672,Ema,"The area with the blood was wiped away, right?"
Rise from the ashes,3,673,Phoenix,We only ended up finding it using chemical means.
Rise from the ashes,3,674,Ema,Any prints in that area will have been wiped away too.
Rise from the ashes,3,675,Phoenix,Oh... right. So... that means no prints.
Rise from the ashes,3,676,Ema,Would you say the probability of your hypothesis is high?
Rise from the ashes,3,677,Phoenix,D-don't ask me!
Rise from the ashes,3,678,Ema,Anyway... We must try to find prints that weren't wiped away.
Rise from the ashes,3,679,Phoenix,(Prints other than the ones left by the bloody hand...)
Rise from the ashes,3,680,_,Comparing... Comparison complete. Match found.
Rise from the ashes,3,681,Phoenix,"Hey, these fingerprints, they..."
Rise from the ashes,3,682,Ema,Whose are they? Whose!? Is it someone I know?
Rise from the ashes,3,683,Phoenix,It's Officer Marshall!!!
Rise from the ashes,3,684,Ema,Huh? O-Officer Jake Marshall!?
Rise from the ashes,3,685,Ema,Th-that's got to be a coincidence! He's not involved in the crime!
Rise from the ashes,3,686,Phoenix,Ema. These are decidedly different from Detective Gumshoe's prints.
Rise from the ashes,3,687,Ema,...!
Rise from the ashes,3,688,Phoenix,The luminol reaction. The blood and the fingerprints are in the same place.
Rise from the ashes,3,689,Ema,Oh... Oh!!!
Rise from the ashes,3,690,Phoenix,"(So, we have Jake Marshall's fingerprints... on a wiped bloodstain!)"
Rise from the ashes,3,691,Ema,But why would Officer Marshall...
Rise from the ashes,3,692,Phoenix,It looks like our investigation is finally turning up some results!
Rise from the ashes,3,693,Ema,...!
Rise from the ashes,3,694,Phoenix,"I guess this is what you'd call ""decisive evidence""!"
Rise from the ashes,3,695,Ema,I... I don't believe it!
Rise from the ashes,4,0,Ema,"So, what do you think, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,4,1,Phoenix,I think the prosecution is as confused as we are. After all...
Rise from the ashes,4,2,Lana,"the victim was murdered in two different places at the same time, and a different suspect was arrested at the other crime scene."
Rise from the ashes,4,3,Ema,Lana!
Rise from the ashes,4,4,Lana,"Good morning, Mr. Wright. I apologize for yesterday. I was... indisposed."
Rise from the ashes,4,5,Phoenix,I hope they didn't hold you too long for questioning.
Rise from the ashes,4,6,Lana,"We just finished, actually. I'm used to all-nighters, though."
Rise from the ashes,4,7,Ema,"So, how'd it go?"
Rise from the ashes,4,8,Lana,"It's as Mr. Wright suspects. The police are clueless. I figured as much, so I struck a plea bargain."
Rise from the ashes,4,9,Ema,A plea bargain? What do you mean by that?
Rise from the ashes,4,10,Lana,"We agreed that if I told them the truth behind this ""simultaneous murder,"" they wouldn't seek capital punishment. That's what I mean, Ema."
Rise from the ashes,4,11,Ema,But Lana! Don't tell me you...
Rise from the ashes,4,12,Lana,"Much to my regret, I'm as much in the dark about this as they are."
Rise from the ashes,4,13,Phoenix,Ms. Skye.
Rise from the ashes,4,14,Lana,Hmm?
Rise from the ashes,4,15,Phoenix,We discovered traces left by a certain person in the Police Department's evidence room. They belonged to Officer Jake Marshall.
Rise from the ashes,4,16,Lana,You found Officer Marshall's... traces?
Rise from the ashes,4,17,Phoenix,"Blood-stained fingerprints, to be exact."
Rise from the ashes,4,18,Lana,!
Rise from the ashes,4,19,Phoenix,"That's the trump card I have up my sleeve today. You do understand what this means, don't you?"
Rise from the ashes,4,20,Ema,"In order to defend my sister, you're going to accuse Mr. Marshall?"
Rise from the ashes,4,21,Phoenix,"We have to play the cards we're dealt. Isn't that right, Ms. Skye?"
Rise from the ashes,4,22,Lana,"... Do what you have to do, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,4,23,Judge,Court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye.
Rise from the ashes,4,24,Phoenix,"The defense is ready, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,4,25,Edgeworth,The prosecution is... Hmph.
Rise from the ashes,4,26,Judge,... Hmph? I'm afraid you'll have to clarify.
Rise from the ashes,4,27,Edgeworth,"It takes 30 minutes by car to reach criminal affairs from the Prosecutor's Office. The victim, Bruce Goodman, was slain at both places at the same time."
Rise from the ashes,4,28,Judge,"But, that's not physically possible, is it? What's more, I hear the victim from the evidence room just ""disappeared""!"
Rise from the ashes,4,29,Ema,"Yes, and the body eventually reappeared in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car."
Rise from the ashes,4,30,Phoenix,(Wow... this is one messed up trial...)
Rise from the ashes,4,31,Edgeworth,"One of my duties as prosecutor is to present impartial evidence. Today I will present evidence relating to the murder at the Police Department. In so doing, I believe the way in which we should proceed will reveal itself."
Rise from the ashes,4,32,Ema,Now that's what sets Mr. Edgeworth apart. He sounds so on top of things... even though he doesn't know what's going on himself!
Rise from the ashes,4,33,Phoenix,And that's supposed to be an admirable trait?
Rise from the ashes,4,34,Judge,"Very well, let the trial resume. On the day of the crime, what exactly transpired at the Police Department? Mr. Edgeworth, you may call your first witness of the day to the stand."
Rise from the ashes,4,35,Edgeworth,"For its first witness, the prosecution calls... the suspect of the murder that occurred at the Police Department!"
Rise from the ashes,4,36,Judge,"The suspect!? You mean, the so-called murderer!?"
Rise from the ashes,4,37,Phoenix,(Hoo boy. Things are getting wild from the get-go.)
Rise from the ashes,4,38,Edgeworth,Will the witness please state his name and occupation.
Rise from the ashes,4,39,Meekins,"Yes, sir! I am Officer Mike Meekins, sir! My occupation is, um... that would be murderer, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,40,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,4,41,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,4,42,Judge,"... Er... So you're telling us you're a ""professional killer""..."
Rise from the ashes,4,43,Meekins,"Sir. It was me, sir! I'm the one who did it! I'll never kill anyone again, sir! You've got to believe me, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,44,Judge,"Uh... Actually, what we'd like to hear from you is..."
Rise from the ashes,4,45,Meekins,"Sir! I'm what you would call part of the ""younger generation,"" sir! A person whose actions adults can't possibly comprehend!"
Rise from the ashes,4,46,Judge,"Please, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Help me, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,47,Edgeworth,Officer Meekins.
Rise from the ashes,4,48,Meekins,"Y-yes, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,49,Edgeworth,Give us your report of the crime. Consider that an order.
Rise from the ashes,4,50,Meekins,"Yes, sir! As you wish! After all, I am part of a generation that must be told what to do, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,51,Ema,You can't fault him for a lack of enthusiasm.
Rise from the ashes,4,52,Judge,"Hmm. So the victim, Detective Goodman, attacked you?"
Rise from the ashes,4,53,Meekins,"""Do unto others before they do unto you""! That's the Meekins family motto, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,54,Judge,"I see. Then you fainted, and a colleague helped you regain consciousness."
Rise from the ashes,4,55,Meekins,"Yes, sir! He knocked me upside the head, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,56,Judge,Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination.
Rise from the ashes,4,57,Phoenix,(What I need here is more info to work with!)
Rise from the ashes,4,58,Meekins,"Although it's not my normal duty, I was assigned to guard the evidence room that day!"
Rise from the ashes,4,59,Phoenix,"Mr. Meekins. You work in the General Affairs Department, do you not?"
Rise from the ashes,4,60,Meekins,"Yes, sir! I am in charge of hiring new recruits, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,61,Phoenix,(Yikes! Now there's a scary thought.)
Rise from the ashes,4,62,Edgeworth,"Evidence transferal was taking place on the day of the crime, which meant many officers were given special tasks not ordinarily performed."
Rise from the ashes,4,63,Meekins,"I was in charge of guarding the Blue Badger, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,64,Judge,The Blue Badger?
Rise from the ashes,4,65,Meekins,"Yes, sir. The lovely police mascot created by the Head Detective, sir! I was to ensure it wasn't broken during the transferal process. That was my sole mission for the day, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,66,Judge,"I see. Sounds like a very... uh, important mission."
Rise from the ashes,4,67,Meekins,"After the awards ceremony finished that day, there were so many people running around that I relocated the Blue Badger to the evidence room!"
Rise from the ashes,4,68,Judge,Oh... So that's why you went to the evidence room.
Rise from the ashes,4,69,Edgeworth,Tell us... what did you see when you got there?
Rise from the ashes,4,70,Meekins,"I spotted a suspicious man on the security screen, and rushed into the room!"
Rise from the ashes,4,71,Phoenix,"In order to enter the evidence room... you need an ID card, am I correct?"
Rise from the ashes,4,72,Meekins,"Precisely, sir! I have one right here around my neck!"
Rise from the ashes,4,73,Phoenix,"So then... your ID number should be listed in here, right?"
Rise from the ashes,4,74,Meekins,... There it is! I found it! This is the one right here.
Rise from the ashes,4,75,Judge,Could you please read us the number?
Rise from the ashes,4,76,Meekins,"Yes, sir! It's ""4989596."" That's my number, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,77,Phoenix,I see... Huh? But the number 4989596... is shown as being used twice!
Rise from the ashes,4,78,Edgeworth,"Please explain, witness."
Rise from the ashes,4,79,Meekins,"It's n-no real mystery, sir! The first time is when I relocated Blue Badger to the evidence room, and the second time is when I went to go get him after everything settled down."
Rise from the ashes,4,80,Judge,I see. So it was during that second time when?
Rise from the ashes,4,81,Meekins,"Yes, sir! That was when I spotted the man on the security screen!"
Rise from the ashes,4,82,Meekins,"I was only doing what I was trained to do, sir! I was suddenly attacked!"
Rise from the ashes,4,83,Phoenix,So you were attacked... Can you please tell us exactly what happened to you?
Rise from the ashes,4,84,Meekins,"It was a knife, sir! A knife!"
Rise from the ashes,4,85,Judge,Detective Goodman pulled a knife on you? What happened then?
Rise from the ashes,4,86,Meekins,"Well, with me charging in on him like that, he looked as surprised as I was!"
Rise from the ashes,4,87,Phoenix,(You aren't exactly the kind of person someone would want to run into...)
Rise from the ashes,4,88,Meekins,"That's when I reacted, sir! I swung my arms like an octopus, struggling to detain him! That's how I got this gash on my hand."
Rise from the ashes,4,89,Ema,Maybe if you'd just kept your cool your hand wouldn't be...
Rise from the ashes,4,90,Meekins,"When I saw the blood trickling down my arm, I panicked! I grabbed the man by his collar!"
Rise from the ashes,4,91,Meekins,I fought for my life! Then I... I did it!
Rise from the ashes,4,92,Phoenix,"What exactly do you mean when you say you, ""did it""?"
Rise from the ashes,4,93,Meekins,"I know I don't look the type, but I'm really into kung fu films, sir! The man let his guard down for just an instant, so I snatched his knife from him!"
Rise from the ashes,4,94,Phoenix,You took his knife?
Rise from the ashes,4,95,Meekins,I spun him around and performed a disarming maneuver! I made sure to close my eyes like a man!
Rise from the ashes,4,96,Phoenix,"I, uh, see... (He must have been desperate.)"
Rise from the ashes,4,97,Meekins,"The next thing I knew, his white coat was drenched in a sea of my blood, and then... Then, the next thing I knew..."
Rise from the ashes,4,98,Judge,Yes?
Rise from the ashes,4,99,Meekins,"He punched me right in my face, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,100,Meekins,After that I passed out... until another officer smacked me awake!
Rise from the ashes,4,101,Phoenix,About what time did you regain consciousness?
Rise from the ashes,4,102,Meekins,"No offense, sir, but how am I supposed to know that? I was unconscious!"
Rise from the ashes,4,103,Phoenix,Oh... right.
Rise from the ashes,4,104,Edgeworth,"According to the report from the officer that woke up the witness, it was about 5:30."
Rise from the ashes,4,105,Meekins,He hit me right in the head too! I woke up crying tears of pain!
Rise from the ashes,4,106,Judge,"That's nice... Er, I mean... it's nice that you recovered, that is..."
Rise from the ashes,4,107,Meekins,"When I came around though, I made sure to finish my mission, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,108,Phoenix,"Your ""mission""...?"
Rise from the ashes,4,109,Meekins,"Yes, sir! The Blue Badger, sir! I returned him to the entrance before things got out of hand!"
Rise from the ashes,4,110,Phoenix,"(Well, we can all rest easy now...)"
Rise from the ashes,4,111,Judge,I believe we now have a fairly accurate picture of what happened.
Rise from the ashes,4,112,Edgeworth,"Yes, Your Honor. Only one thing remains unclear. Was the man this officer ""murdered,"" really the victim?"
Rise from the ashes,4,113,Phoenix,(He's got a point...)
Rise from the ashes,4,114,Meekins,Um...
Rise from the ashes,4,115,Judge,"Yes, Officer Meekins?"
Rise from the ashes,4,116,Meekins,"With regard to that, sir... Take a look at this. It was sent to my cell. Chief Gant delivered it to me just this morning sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,117,Edgeworth,The Chief?
Rise from the ashes,4,118,Phoenix,Delivered it...?
Rise from the ashes,4,119,Judge,What is that? A... videotape?
Rise from the ashes,4,120,Meekins,"Yes, sir! That's absolutely right, sir! A videotape, sir! It contains footage from the security camera in the evidence room."
Rise from the ashes,4,121,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,122,Edgeworth,"What!? But I specifically asked if there was such a tape, and was told it had been mistakenly erased!"
Rise from the ashes,4,123,Judge,That's quite a mistake.
Rise from the ashes,4,124,Meekins,"I just do what I'm told, sir. It's the only thing I'm really good at."
Rise from the ashes,4,125,Phoenix,(Looks like communication with the Police Department is as good as ever...)
Rise from the ashes,4,126,Judge,"Well then, let's have a look! Show us the video of you murdering the victim!"
Rise from the ashes,4,127,Meekins,"Oh... Please stop using that word, ""murder,"" sir! It scares me!"
Rise from the ashes,4,128,Phoenix,(A video of a real murder... Just what are we getting ourselves into...?) ...
Rise from the ashes,4,129,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,4,130,Meekins,...
Rise from the ashes,4,131,Judge,"Well, I believe we're all thinking the same thing. How can we deal with these unsettling feelings stirred within us...?"
Rise from the ashes,4,132,Edgeworth,What the hell was that wriggling piece of plywood!?
Rise from the ashes,4,133,Meekins,"Sir! That is the pride and joy of the entire Criminal Affairs Department, sir! It's the Blue Badger, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,134,Phoenix,(Why am I not surprised this isn't going smoothly?)
Rise from the ashes,4,135,Judge,"Yes, well anyway... this tape seems to prove that that the witness did indeed encounter... er, ""someone"" in the evidence room, and some sort of... er, ""activity"" did take place..."
Rise from the ashes,4,136,Edgeworth,"Your Honor... instead of relying on clearly incomplete footage, the witness's testimony will suffice. Is that alright with you, Officer Meekins?"
Rise from the ashes,4,137,Meekins,"Yes, sir! As you wish, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,138,Judge,What's this about a fingerprint?
Rise from the ashes,4,139,Edgeworth,"Each detective has been given a locker, equipped with a fingerprint-activated lock. These locks ensure that each locker can only be opened by the detective it belongs to."
Rise from the ashes,4,140,Judge,Intriguing... That would mean... the victim at the crime scene would have to have been Detective Goodman. Very well! The defense may begin its cross-examination!
Rise from the ashes,4,141,Phoenix,"(I don't know where this cross-examination will lead, but everything begins with contradictions. That's where I have to start!)"
Rise from the ashes,4,142,Meekins,"His face can't be clearly seen in the video,"
Rise from the ashes,4,143,Phoenix,"Tell me, were you able to get a good look at him? At the face of the man who attacked you with a knife?"
Rise from the ashes,4,144,Meekins,"S-sir! If you must label people as having ""seen"" or ""not seen"" the man's face... I believe I would be classified as... the latter?"
Rise from the ashes,4,145,Phoenix,"The latter? But you were standing right in front of him, were you not?"
Rise from the ashes,4,146,Judge,"More to the point, you are the person who fought him, aren't you?"
Rise from the ashes,4,147,Meekins,"Oh, yes sir! But... I didn't get a clear look at his face, sir. I'm not the kind of guy who looks directly at people when talking with them, you see..."
Rise from the ashes,4,148,Phoenix,"(Yeah, that's a good trait for a police officer...)"
Rise from the ashes,4,149,Meekins,"Still, I'm sure it was him! I'd bet my badge on it!"
Rise from the ashes,4,150,Meekins,"but there's no question that the other person was Detective Goodman, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,151,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,152,Phoenix,"But you don't know that for sure, do you? You never actually saw Detective Goodman's face."
Rise from the ashes,4,153,Meekins,"Well... I suppose you might say that. That is, if you must label people as having ""seen"" or ""not seen"" it."
Rise from the ashes,4,154,Judge,"Since his face can't be identified in the video, only you can verify it."
Rise from the ashes,4,155,Meekins,"! W-w-why is everyone l-looking at me? If I had to label your stares as ""disturbing"" or..."
Rise from the ashes,4,156,Edgeworth,Meekins!
Rise from the ashes,4,157,Meekins,Eek!
Rise from the ashes,4,158,Edgeworth,"Having been shown a questionable video at best, we are not in the best of moods. Now please be more certain when you testify!"
Rise from the ashes,4,159,Meekins,"Y-y-yes, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,160,Edgeworth,You claimed the man who brandished a knife on you was Bruce Goodman. Tell us why you are positive it was him!
Rise from the ashes,4,161,Meekins,"I mean, he opened the locker, which required Detective Goodman's fingerprint to do!"
Rise from the ashes,4,162,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,163,Phoenix,About these lockers... Is there no other way to open them?
Rise from the ashes,4,164,Meekins,"No, sir! I myself tried all kinds of methods in the past! They only respond to registered fingerprints, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,165,Phoenix,(I wonder what kind of methods he's tried...?)
Rise from the ashes,4,166,Judge,"If the man opened the locker's lock, which only responds to its registered fingerprints, then he must be the person the locker was assigned to."
Rise from the ashes,4,167,Meekins,"Exactly my point, sir! And this too!"
Rise from the ashes,4,168,Meekins,"The locker he opened is unquestionably Detective Goodman's locker, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,169,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,170,Phoenix,How do you know that information?
Rise from the ashes,4,171,Meekins,"I've heard rumors, sir! From people in the know, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,172,Phoenix,"""People in the know""?"
Rise from the ashes,4,173,Meekins,"The workers in the department cafeteria, sir! They keep me informed! They also listen to my... romantic troubles, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,174,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,4,175,Edgeworth,For the record... the opened locker did indeed belong to Detective Goodman. I verified this information through a more... reliable source.
Rise from the ashes,4,176,Judge,Hmm... So the victim opened the locker with his own fingerprint.
Rise from the ashes,4,177,Meekins,So it must be him! No one else could have unlocked it!
Rise from the ashes,4,178,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,179,Phoenix,"However, the most important detail is not shown in this video... the man's face!"
Rise from the ashes,4,180,Meekins,"S-sir! If I may say something, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,181,Judge,"Please do. After all, you are the one being examined."
Rise from the ashes,4,182,Meekins,"I don't understand why the man's face is so important in this case, sir! I mean, it was his hand that opened the fingerprint lock... and it was his hand that tried to thrust his knife into my body, sir! My unsettled state can testify enough to this, sir! Yes, you have a point. The footage doesn't lie."
Rise from the ashes,4,183,Edgeworth,That is... unless the defense can find a problem with it?
Rise from the ashes,4,184,Ema,Mr. Wright! Let's check the Court Record again!
Rise from the ashes,4,185,Phoenix,(Is there a problem with the security video?)
Rise from the ashes,4,186,Phoenix,"Regarding the video contained on this tape, there is one thing in particular that seems rather strange."
Rise from the ashes,4,187,Judge,Strange?
Rise from the ashes,4,188,Phoenix,This contradiction leads to the possibility that... the man may not be Detective Goodman.
Rise from the ashes,4,189,Judge,What? This video contains such a contradiction?
Rise from the ashes,4,190,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,191,Edgeworth,"Interesting... Your Honor, I have a proposal."
Rise from the ashes,4,192,Judge,"Yes, Mr. Edgeworth?"
Rise from the ashes,4,193,Edgeworth,"I propose we have the defense... point out to us this alleged ""contradiction"" in the video."
Rise from the ashes,4,194,Phoenix,(He would want me to point it out...)
Rise from the ashes,4,195,Judge,"Very well, proposal accepted. Let us further inspect this piece of evidence. I will now play the security tape. Mr. Wright. Please show us this contradiction you speak of."
Rise from the ashes,4,196,Phoenix,(I have to point out a problem in the video? This is the first time I've ever had to do that.)
Rise from the ashes,4,197,Ema,"You can do it, Mr. Wright! It's set up so you can Fast Forward, Rewind or Pause the video. Just take a good look and be sure to point out the right thing!"
Rise from the ashes,4,198,Meekins,Please don't play it too many times. I-I can't stand watching this video!
Rise from the ashes,4,199,Phoenix,(How did this guy ever become a police officer?)
Rise from the ashes,4,200,Judge,"Now then, Mr. Wright. Please enlighten us! Where is the contradiction that indicates the man may not be Detective Goodman?"
Rise from the ashes,4,201,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,202,Phoenix,The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this! Officer Meekins.
Rise from the ashes,4,203,Meekins,"Sir! D-do you mean me, sir?"
Rise from the ashes,4,204,Phoenix,"As I understand it, the locker apparatus works like this: When you grab the handle, a sensor reads your fingerprint. If the print matches the registered data, the light turns on and the lock is released."
Rise from the ashes,4,205,Meekins,"A-according to my very limited experience, that's the way I understand it, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,206,Phoenix,"If so, then something is seriously wrong with this picture! When the victim reaches for the handle to open the locker... Let's rewind to a little earlier... Here! Notice the light?"
Rise from the ashes,4,207,Judge,What's this!? It's... already lit!
Rise from the ashes,4,208,Phoenix,"Precisely my point, Your Honor. The locker was already open before the victim grabbed the handle!"
Rise from the ashes,4,209,Meekins,AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
Rise from the ashes,4,210,Judge,Order! Order! What's the meaning of this!?
Rise from the ashes,4,211,Phoenix,"It's very simple, Your Honor. The locker wasn't locked on the day of the crime!"
Rise from the ashes,4,212,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,213,Edgeworth,"But the locker locks are controlled by an electronic system. When a door is shut, a sensor is triggered... and the locker is automatically locked!"
Rise from the ashes,4,214,Judge,"Oh, I know! It must have broken down! Of course, I'm not an expert in this..."
Rise from the ashes,4,215,Edgeworth,"That's not likely, Your Honor. The sensor would detect and report any malfunction."
Rise from the ashes,4,216,Judge,"Oh well. It just goes to show novices should keep their mouths shut. So then, Mr. Wright. Do you have an explanation?"
Rise from the ashes,4,217,Phoenix,"Me, Your Honor?"
Rise from the ashes,4,218,Judge,Yes. Why wasn't the locker locked?
Rise from the ashes,4,219,Phoenix,"Me, Your Honor? ... Yes, well. You see... This isn't exactly my field... What do you think, Miss ""Scientific Investigator""?"
Rise from the ashes,4,220,Ema,"Huh? Oh, um... Maybe something, like, jammed the electronic system?"
Rise from the ashes,4,221,Phoenix,(Something... jammed the sensor? Say... There's something else that seems out of place in this video.)
Rise from the ashes,4,222,Ema,"Yeah, I thought so too! There's got to be another clue somewhere in this footage!"
Rise from the ashes,4,223,Judge,Very well. Let's inspect the video once more. The locker wasn't locked... Mr. Wright. Please point out the cause for this!
Rise from the ashes,4,224,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,225,Phoenix,Please watch closely. This is the continuation of the part I showed you earlier.
Rise from the ashes,4,226,Judge,What's this? Something white fell out of the locker!
Rise from the ashes,4,227,Meekins,"But sir! It's been my experience that things fall out when doors are opened! I often fall out and roll great distances when I open my car door, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,228,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,229,Phoenix,We can't be sure that item was in the locker to begin with.
Rise from the ashes,4,230,Judge,What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,4,231,Phoenix,"The sensor triggers the lock when the door is shut... What if something was inserted, say, between the sensor and the door?"
Rise from the ashes,4,232,Judge,In... Inserted...?
Rise from the ashes,4,233,Phoenix,This white thing wasn't inside the locker... It was stuck between the door and the sensor!
Rise from the ashes,4,234,Meekins,"Oh, I understand now, sir! It's just like my tie! Two out of three times it gets stuck in the door when I get out of my patrol vehicle, sir! Instead of the door closing, My tie chokes me!"
Rise from the ashes,4,235,Judge,But the object would have to be extremely thin to fit in the door.
Rise from the ashes,4,236,Edgeworth,"Not only that, it would also have to block electrical currents... It would need to be an insulator."
Rise from the ashes,4,237,Judge,"Yes, an insulator! But at the crime scene..."
Rise from the ashes,4,238,Phoenix,there just might have been something that fits the description.
Rise from the ashes,4,239,Meekins,"But s-sir! By ""insulator,"" you don't mean..."
Rise from the ashes,4,240,Phoenix,(I think I've finally got this figured out.)
Rise from the ashes,4,241,Judge,Very well! Will the defense please present the relevant evidence! What was this insulator that was stuck in the door?
Rise from the ashes,4,242,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,243,Phoenix,I found this near the locker: a thin rubber glove.
Rise from the ashes,4,244,Judge,But we can't be sure that was in the victim's locker.
Rise from the ashes,4,245,Phoenix,"It has a tag that says, ""SL-9 Incident."""
Rise from the ashes,4,246,Edgeworth,!
Rise from the ashes,4,247,Phoenix,"The video seems to depict the victim opening the locker, but that isn't the case! The lit lamp attests to this. On the day of the crime, even I could have opened that locker! Is this not so, Officer Meekins!?"
Rise from the ashes,4,248,Meekins,"Sir... It would appear so, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,249,Judge,"Order! Order! Order! So are we to believe then, that the ""victim"" whom this witness stabbed in the evidence room... was not Detective Goodman?"
Rise from the ashes,4,250,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,251,Edgeworth,"Do not be misled, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,4,252,Judge,"What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?"
Rise from the ashes,4,253,Edgeworth,"The defense has merely demonstrated that possibility, and nothing more. The ""victim"" in the video was indeed Bruce Goodman. The prosecution will offer one more testimony to prove this!"
Rise from the ashes,4,254,Phoenix,What!?
Rise from the ashes,4,255,Edgeworth,"Officer Meekins, please testify about this."
Rise from the ashes,4,256,Meekins,"Sir! M-me, sir!? I'm not sure what you're referring too, sir..."
Rise from the ashes,4,257,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,4,258,Meekins,"O-oh! You mean that, sir! Of course, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,259,Phoenix,(Is this a joke...?)
Rise from the ashes,4,260,Judge,"Very well, begin your testimony!"
Rise from the ashes,4,261,Judge,An ID card record. I see...
Rise from the ashes,4,262,Edgeworth,"I have the ID card record right here, Your Honor. The ID used at 5:14... is that of the victim."
Rise from the ashes,4,263,Judge,"Just before the crime, hmm? Yes, without a doubt this is the victim's ID! However, one thing does strike me as unusual... Several hundred cases should have been due for transferal. Why were there so few people using this room?"
Rise from the ashes,4,264,Edgeworth,This particular evidence room is only used for storing certain special cases.
Rise from the ashes,4,265,Phoenix,"""Special"" cases...?"
Rise from the ashes,4,266,Edgeworth,Extremely violent cases involving police staff.
Rise from the ashes,4,267,Ema,Just hearing that makes my hair stand on end!
Rise from the ashes,4,268,Phoenix,"(Me too, although it doesn't make much of a difference...)"
Rise from the ashes,4,269,Edgeworth,"There were only a few cases up for transferal there, and most were cleared up by noon."
Rise from the ashes,4,270,Judge,"Right... I see. Now, Let us move on to the cross-examination."
Rise from the ashes,4,271,Meekins,"There's one other thing that proves the man was Detective Goodman, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,272,Phoenix,"So, unlike your earlier testimony, you believe this to be rock solid, do you?"
Rise from the ashes,4,273,Meekins,"Yes, sir! Solid as stone, sir! If my hand wasn't wrapped in bandages... I'd even give the 'V for Victory' sign, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,274,Ema,Couldn't he just use his right hand for that...?
Rise from the ashes,4,275,Judge,Let's hear him out. The witness can't afford to make any more mistakes.
Rise from the ashes,4,276,Meekins,"To enter the evidence room, one must use their ID card!"
Rise from the ashes,4,277,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,278,Phoenix,Is that card hanging from your neck one of these ID cards?
Rise from the ashes,4,279,Meekins,"Yes, sir! This card right next to my cuffs, sir! I keep it here so I won't ever forget it!"
Rise from the ashes,4,280,Phoenix,"But what if someone were to steal it from you, keeping it out in the open like that?"
Rise from the ashes,4,281,Meekins,"... Maybe I shouldn't wear it around my neck... Remember when I said two out of three times my tie gets stuck in my car door when I get out? Well, the remaining time my ID card gets stuck. Instead of the door closing, my ID card chokes me!"
Rise from the ashes,4,282,Phoenix,(Maybe I should just leave this one alone...)
Rise from the ashes,4,283,Edgeworth,"At any rate, each police officer has only one ID card. Both the Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office can attest to this."
Rise from the ashes,4,284,Judge,Please proceed with your testimony.
Rise from the ashes,4,285,Meekins,"When an ID card is used, there's a record of it!"
Rise from the ashes,4,286,Phoenix,
Rise from the ashes,4,287,Phoenix,Let it be noted that this is the record the witness referred to.
Rise from the ashes,4,288,Judge,"Let me see... yes, that would be it. Detective Goodman..."
Rise from the ashes,4,289,Phoenix,? (What's the matter?)
Rise from the ashes,4,290,Judge,A-according to this... Mr. Edgeworth! Your name is on here!
Rise from the ashes,4,291,Edgeworth,"So it is, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,4,292,Phoenix,"(You've got the wrong color, kid.)"
Rise from the ashes,4,293,Judge,It would seem... the inquiry committee will want to speak with you again today.
Rise from the ashes,4,294,Edgeworth,"I have nothing to be ashamed of regarding my actions, or their consequences. For now, let us continue with the cross-examination."
Rise from the ashes,4,295,Ema,Poor Mr. Edgeworth... It must be so difficult for him...
Rise from the ashes,4,296,Meekins,"At the time of the crime, the detective had used his card!"
Rise from the ashes,4,297,Phoenix,
Rise from the ashes,4,298,Phoenix,"Earlier I believe you testified that when you asked the man to show his ID card, he pulled a knife on you."
Rise from the ashes,4,299,Meekins,"Yes, sir! He didn't show me any ID card, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,300,Phoenix,"Don't you think that's odd? I mean, if he had his ID card, all he had to do was show it to you. There wouldn't be any reason to draw a knife!"
Rise from the ashes,4,301,Meekins,... M-maybe he just panicked?
Rise from the ashes,4,302,Phoenix,(Everything stems from contradictions. Let's point them out...)
Rise from the ashes,4,303,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,304,Phoenix,"Wait one moment, Officer Meekins."
Rise from the ashes,4,305,Meekins,"I-I'm not good at waiting, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,306,Phoenix,I have the victim's ID card right here. I found it at the crime scene.
Rise from the ashes,4,307,Judge,That makes sense.
Rise from the ashes,4,308,Phoenix,"When I say, ""crime scene,"" I'm not referring to the evidence room at the Police Department. I mean the ""other"" crime scene... The underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office!"
Rise from the ashes,4,309,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,4,310,Phoenix,Your Honor... I have one more piece of evidence to present. It's a very important clue regarding the victim's ID card.
Rise from the ashes,4,311,Judge,"A... Lost Item Report? It's only half completed,"
Rise from the ashes,4,312,Phoenix,"but it shows that Detective Goodman had lost ""something"" on the day of the crime. Something important enough to fill out this report."
Rise from the ashes,4,313,Edgeworth,"Let me guess. You believe this ""something"" to be his ID card, right?"
Rise from the ashes,4,314,Phoenix,"I can't say for sure... but there is a high probability! On the day of the crime, Detective Goodman was not carrying his card!"
Rise from the ashes,4,315,Judge,Order! Order! So now... what does this all mean?
Rise from the ashes,4,316,Phoenix,"It can only mean one thing. It doesn't require much thought! The man Officer Meekins encountered in the evidence room... was not Detective Goodman, but rather the man who stole his ID card!"
Rise from the ashes,4,317,Judge,Order! Order! Order! Does the prosecution have a response?
Rise from the ashes,4,318,Edgeworth,... I have only one thing to say to the defense.
Rise from the ashes,4,319,Phoenix,...?
Rise from the ashes,4,320,Edgeworth,"Bravo, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,4,321,Phoenix,B-bravo...?
Rise from the ashes,4,322,Edgeworth,"Allow me to summarize the defense's argument. At 5:15 PM on the day of the crime, the man Officer Meekins encountered in the evidence room was not Detective Goodman. There are two grounds to support this. First, the locker in the evidence room was already unlocked. Second, the victim lost his ID card. Am I correct so far, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,4,323,Phoenix,Yes... (What's he up to?)
Rise from the ashes,4,324,Edgeworth,"That being the case, we must inevitably arrive at a single conclusion: If the ""victim"" in this video is a fake... then the murder in the evidence room is also fake! In other words, the security camera does not show the instant of the murder."
Rise from the ashes,4,325,Phoenix,"Uh... Th-that is... Well, I guess that's right..."
Rise from the ashes,4,326,Edgeworth,"Is something wrong, Mr. Wright? Only moments ago you seemed content to be pointing your finger around."
Rise from the ashes,4,327,Phoenix,This isn't good...
Rise from the ashes,4,328,Edgeworth,"Well, well... It seems you've finally realized... exactly what you've gone to such lengths to prove!"
Rise from the ashes,4,329,Judge,"Explain yourself, Mr. Edgeworth!"
Rise from the ashes,4,330,Edgeworth,The defense has already done the explaining for me. The victim in this video is a fake... which means a murder did not take place at the Police Department at 5:15 on the day of the crime.
Rise from the ashes,4,331,Judge,So...
Rise from the ashes,4,332,Edgeworth,"So the real crime could only take place at one location: the underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office! The murderer being Ms. Lana Skye, the defendant! The evidence is compelling! A trustworthy witness... observed moment the defendant used the murder weapon!"
Rise from the ashes,4,333,Phoenix,Aaaah! (I knew that testimony was way too shabby. It was all a trap from the beginning!)
Rise from the ashes,4,334,Judge,"The activity in the evidence room still leaves many questions unanswered: Who exactly was the ""victim"" Officer Meekins encountered? And where did this person disappear to...? However... This trial's purpose is to examine only the murder of Detective Goodman."
Rise from the ashes,4,335,Edgeworth,"Just so, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,4,336,Ema,"Mr. Wright! You have to do something, or else Lana..."
Rise from the ashes,4,337,Phoenix,(What do I do? How am I supposed to get myself out of this mess?)
Rise from the ashes,4,338,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,339,Phoenix,"One moment, Your Honor!"
Rise from the ashes,4,340,Edgeworth,"What now, Mr. Wright? Don't tell me you're objecting to what you've just proven."
Rise from the ashes,4,341,Phoenix,Of course not. But I almost walked right into the prosecution's trap!
Rise from the ashes,4,342,Edgeworth,What are you talking about?
Rise from the ashes,4,343,Phoenix,"This cross-examination has proven one thing and one thing only. The security video did not show the actual murder. However! It cannot be said that it is unrelated to the murder in the parking lot. Specifically, large amounts of blood traces were found in the evidence room!"
Rise from the ashes,4,344,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,4,345,Phoenix,The defense demands further examination into the truth of the matter!
Rise from the ashes,4,346,Judge,...Mr. Edgeworth.
Rise from the ashes,4,347,Edgeworth,"Yes, Your Honor?"
Rise from the ashes,4,348,Judge,"If this court were to examine this further, other witnesses will be necessary. Is the prosecution prepared?"
Rise from the ashes,4,349,Edgeworth,"I'm sorry, Your Honor... The prosecution considered the incident at the Police Department to be unrelated. We have not prepared any other witnesses for this incident."
Rise from the ashes,4,350,Phoenix,(This just might be my chance. Time to call a certain Texas ranger to the stand!)
Rise from the ashes,4,351,Ema,Mr. Wright... Do you mean...
Rise from the ashes,4,352,Phoenix,Your Honor. The defense would like to request a specific witness.
Rise from the ashes,4,353,Judge,Oh? Whom do you have in mind?
Rise from the ashes,4,354,Phoenix,Someone we have reason to believe knows the truth... The truth behind the activities that took place in the evidence room.
Rise from the ashes,4,355,Edgeworth,The prosecution requests to hear this person's name before deciding whether or not to comply.
Rise from the ashes,4,356,Judge,"Very well, then. Mr. Wright! This person whom you would have testify... What is his or her name?"
Rise from the ashes,4,357,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,358,Phoenix,Officer... Jake Marshall.
Rise from the ashes,4,359,Edgeworth,Why him?
Rise from the ashes,4,360,Phoenix,(I can't let him know everything just yet...) He's in charge of the evidence room. I feel we should hear what he has to say.
Rise from the ashes,4,361,Edgeworth,"The prosecution agrees to the defense's request. Since he was responsible for guarding the room, we should hear his testimony. Fortunately he works in the Police Department. We shouldn't need longer than 20 minutes to prepare."
Rise from the ashes,4,362,Judge,Very well. The court will take a 30 minute recess while the witness is subpoenaed. Will the prosecution please prepare the witness during this time?
Rise from the ashes,4,363,Edgeworth,"We will, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,4,364,Judge,Court in recess!
Rise from the ashes,4,365,Lana,"... There's no stopping you is there, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,4,366,Phoenix,Huh? What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,4,367,Lana,You called for Jake Marshall. It seems you've figured everything out.
Rise from the ashes,4,368,Phoenix,Uh... (I haven't figured anything out...)
Rise from the ashes,4,369,Ema,Lana... You're the one who knows everything!
Rise from the ashes,4,370,Lana,Ema...
Rise from the ashes,4,371,Ema,You always know everything! Why don't you just tell us!? Mr. Wright is trying his hardest to protect you!
Rise from the ashes,4,372,Lana,"I... I don't recall ever asking for his ""protection."""
Rise from the ashes,4,373,Ema,How can you be so cold... Don't you trust us? Don't you trust... me?
Rise from the ashes,4,374,Lana,...
Rise from the ashes,4,375,Gumshoe,"Hope I'm not interrupting anything, pals."
Rise from the ashes,4,376,Lana,...
Rise from the ashes,4,377,Ema,...
Rise from the ashes,4,378,Gumshoe,Oh... Guess I am. I'll come back later.
Rise from the ashes,4,379,Phoenix,"Oh, Detective Gumshoe! What is it?"
Rise from the ashes,4,380,Gumshoe,"You've got a lot of nerve, pal! Making a detective run all around while on duty, and to top it off you call me here... I've seen happier people at funerals!"
Rise from the ashes,4,381,Lana,"Sorry, Detective."
Rise from the ashes,4,382,Gumshoe,"You better be, pal...Hey... Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Hey!!!! I didn't see you there, Ms. Skye!"
Rise from the ashes,4,383,Lana,That's ok. So... Have you brought what I asked?
Rise from the ashes,4,384,Gumshoe,"Oh... Oh ho! Oh ho ho! Oh ho ho ho! Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho! You mean this, right!?"
Rise from the ashes,4,385,Lana,"My apologies, Detective. Due to my present circumstances, I was forced to use Mr. Wright's name when making my request."
Rise from the ashes,4,386,Phoenix,My name!?
Rise from the ashes,4,387,Gumshoe,"Never in a million years would I have thought it was you who asked me, ""Could I bother you to bring me the SL-9 Incident files?"" ""I'll need them by noon."" Talk about crazy..."
Rise from the ashes,4,388,Phoenix,"The ""SL-9 Incident""?"
Rise from the ashes,4,389,Ema,But Lana! That's...
Rise from the ashes,4,390,Lana,"I thought Mr. Wright might need them, so I had them brought here. Here. You might do well to read them."
Rise from the ashes,4,391,Gumshoe,"I can't believe you, the Chief Prosecutor, were a witness in that case!"
Rise from the ashes,4,392,Phoenix,Ms. Skye... was a witness?
Rise from the ashes,4,393,Gumshoe,"Take it from me, you don't want anything to do with serial murders."
Rise from the ashes,4,394,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,4,395,Gumshoe,"Oh, what? Now that I've brought you your stuff, you're just gonna ignore me?"
Rise from the ashes,4,396,Phoenix,E-Ema! But why... Why is your name in here?
Rise from the ashes,4,397,Ema,"What? My name's in there!? I don't know... Unless... No, it couldn't be... Lana! This ""SL-9 Incident""... Is that..."
Rise from the ashes,4,398,Lana,"... That's the classification number the police filed it under. Two years ago, the rest of the world knew it as... the ""Joe Darke Killings."""
Rise from the ashes,4,399,Ema,"The... Joe Darke... No... No, Lana! That's over with! No!!!"
Rise from the ashes,4,400,Phoenix,"Ema, wait! (She ran away...)"
Rise from the ashes,4,401,Gumshoe,"Uh, ya know what? I just remembered... I gotta be somewhere. Sorry pal, but I'm outta here!"
Rise from the ashes,4,402,Phoenix,"(Jake Marshall, Angel Starr, Damon Gant, Miles Edgeworth... Not to mention Lana and Ema...) Everyone involved in this case is connected to those killings two years ago... This can't be just a ""coincidence."""
Rise from the ashes,4,403,Lana,"Knowing you, you just might be able to figure it out. Time to get back to the trial, Mr. Wright. Best of luck."
Rise from the ashes,4,404,Phoenix,(I'd better take a good look at this file...)
Rise from the ashes,4,405,Judge,The court will now reconvene for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye.
Rise from the ashes,4,406,Phoenix,(Ema didn't come back...)
Rise from the ashes,4,407,Edgeworth,Allow me to call the next witness to the stand: the officer in charge of guarding the evidence room on the day of the crime.
Rise from the ashes,4,408,Edgeworth,"Witness, please state your name and occupation."
Rise from the ashes,4,409,Marshall,"Me, pardner? Oh, I'm just a man, same as you, wanderin' the trails of civilization,"
Rise from the ashes,4,410,Edgeworth,occasionally helping the elderly cross intersections when needed.
Rise from the ashes,4,411,Judge,"Oh, I know! You're a ""patrolman""!"
Rise from the ashes,4,412,Marshall,"As for my name, if you listen hard 'nuff, you can hear the howling wind calling it out."
Rise from the ashes,4,413,Edgeworth,"To be exact, it's Jake Marshall... Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,4,414,Phoenix,"(""Howling wind""...? I've never heard Edgeworth described that way before...)"
Rise from the ashes,4,415,Edgeworth,"Now, Mr. Marshall. Let me ask you something. You were in charge of guarding the evidence room on the day the crime took place. Is this correct?"
Rise from the ashes,4,416,Marshall,"According to the papers, pardner."
Rise from the ashes,4,417,Judge,What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,4,418,Marshall,"A desperado's soul is as boundless as the desert sands. No ""paper"" can sum it up."
Rise from the ashes,4,419,Judge,Maybe it's best we get on with this quickly. Please share with us your testimony of the day of the crime... in English!
Rise from the ashes,4,420,Judge,I can't say I particularly care for your attitude...
Rise from the ashes,4,421,Marshall,"I can't say I care for your beard, but you don't see me complainin'."
Rise from the ashes,4,422,Phoenix,"Wait a minute... What do you mean by ""two security systems""?"
Rise from the ashes,4,423,Marshall,I mean the security cameras and the ID card reader. I reckon even a cowpoke like you knows about those.
Rise from the ashes,4,424,Phoenix,"Yes, well, what about the fingerprint activated locks inside the evidence room?"
Rise from the ashes,4,425,Marshall,Fingerprint activated locks? What kind of new-fangled doohickeys are those?
Rise from the ashes,4,426,Phoenix,(He's not being very helpful...)
Rise from the ashes,4,427,Edgeworth,He's not that good with machines... or with following orders.
Rise from the ashes,4,428,Marshall,"Everyone's got their weaknesses, now don't they, Mr. Prosecutor?"
Rise from the ashes,4,429,Judge,"This one seems like trouble. Okay Mr. Wright, he's all yours."
Rise from the ashes,4,430,Marshall,My job was to keep a wary eye on that bone orchard.
Rise from the ashes,4,431,Phoenix,"How exactly did you ""keep an eye"" on the evidence room?"
Rise from the ashes,4,432,Marshall,"I just made sure nothing moved in the security camera monitor. That room's so still, even time dies in there. I was just a caretaker who interred the recordings."
Rise from the ashes,4,433,Phoenix,"You ""interred"" them?"
Rise from the ashes,4,434,Marshall,"Videos of nothing aren't that useful. When the time would come, I'd erase the tape."
Rise from the ashes,4,435,Edgeworth,"If nothing unusual is recorded, tapes are to be erased every six hours."
Rise from the ashes,4,436,Marshall,"Each time I'd erase a tape, it felt like I was erasing a part of my life."
Rise from the ashes,4,437,Phoenix,"(This guy has a flare for the dramatic, but it isn't going to do him any good.) So, in actuality you don't physically enter the evidence room?"
Rise from the ashes,4,438,Marshall,"They said I was supposed to make rounds three times a day, but that ain't my style."
Rise from the ashes,4,439,Phoenix,"But you made your rounds on the day of the crime, right?"
Rise from the ashes,4,440,Marshall,"Ain't you heard a word I said, pardner? I told you that ain't my style."
Rise from the ashes,4,441,Phoenix,"... Um, I'm afraid I don't understand."
Rise from the ashes,4,442,Marshall,"No desperado I know lets ""rules"" get in his way."
Rise from the ashes,4,443,Phoenix,(No desperados I know join the police force...)
Rise from the ashes,4,444,Judge,"So, Officer Marshall. On the day of the crime...?"
Rise from the ashes,4,445,Marshall,"Just between you and me, I didn't set foot in the evidence room that day."
Rise from the ashes,4,446,Judge,There was a rubber glove stuck in the victim's locker. Do you know anything about that?
Rise from the ashes,4,447,Marshall,"Sorry pardner, can't say I do. I haven't been in that crypt in weeks."
Rise from the ashes,4,448,Phoenix,(How does this guy avoid being fired...?)
Rise from the ashes,4,449,Marshall,"Besides, the room's protected by two security systems, anyway."
Rise from the ashes,4,450,Phoenix,"You used to be a detective, so you've used the evidence room in the past, correct?"
Rise from the ashes,4,451,Marshall,Of course. Back in the day my locker was a goldmine of evidence!
Rise from the ashes,4,452,Phoenix,And yet... you didn't know about the fingerprint locking mechanism?
Rise from the ashes,4,453,Marshall,"Sorry, pardner. I ain't good with machines. I couldn't even tell you how a bike works."
Rise from the ashes,4,454,Phoenix,"That's quite, uh... incredible."
Rise from the ashes,4,455,Edgeworth,The sensors on the locker handles cannot be seen. It's well known that some detectives are unaware of their presence.
Rise from the ashes,4,456,Phoenix,"(Now that he mentions it, Detective Gumshoe said something like that too...)"
Rise from the ashes,4,457,Judge,"At any rate, it doesn't seem that this is relevant to the crime. Can you tell us what you were doing when the crime took place?"
Rise from the ashes,4,458,Marshall,"If I remember right, I was at a street-side saloon at the time it went down."
Rise from the ashes,4,459,Phoenix,
Rise from the ashes,4,460,Phoenix,What were you doing in a place like that?
Rise from the ashes,4,461,Marshall,I was eating spaghetti. Not even Angel's steak lunches can beat that parlor's vongole sepia pasta.
Rise from the ashes,4,462,Judge,Do you mean to tell us... you abandoned your police duties to eat some noodles?
Rise from the ashes,4,463,Marshall,"Not all desperados eat tacos, pardner."
Rise from the ashes,4,464,Judge,That's not what I meant... I hope this has at least taught you a lesson!
Rise from the ashes,4,465,Phoenix,"(That's strange... This is usually where Edgeworth says, ""Did you not want a raise this year?""...)"
Rise from the ashes,4,466,Marshall,"I'm just an innocent travelin' man, so if you're out of ammo it's time I hit the trail."
Rise from the ashes,4,467,Phoenix,
Rise from the ashes,4,468,Phoenix,"Out of ""ammo,"" officer Marshall?"
Rise from the ashes,4,469,Marshall,"That's right, pardner. Or as you'd call it, ""evidence."" If you plan to pin me to this crime, then you'd better draw. Otherwise, you're just wastin' my time. My steel horse is waitin' to carry me back west into the sunset."
Rise from the ashes,4,470,Judge,"Hmm... One thing seems clear. Despite being responsible for guarding the evidence room, the witness doesn't appear to have seen anything."
Rise from the ashes,4,471,Marshall,Texans don't take orders from anyone. Everyone knows that.
Rise from the ashes,4,472,Phoenix,(Apparently your superiors don't...)
Rise from the ashes,4,473,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,474,Phoenix,"Officer Marshall. Doesn't it strike you as odd? That is, you being called in to testify like this?"
Rise from the ashes,4,475,Marshall,...
Rise from the ashes,4,476,Phoenix,"After all, you weren't in the security room at the time of the crime."
Rise from the ashes,4,477,Marshall,"And yet you dragged me down here. Explain yourself, pardner."
Rise from the ashes,4,478,Phoenix,"It's quite simple. You left a very large trail behind at the scene. Or, to be exact... a handprint."
Rise from the ashes,4,479,Marshall,"Hmph! Listen real good, pardner. Like I said, I'm the caretaker of that crypt. I pay my respects... that is, make my rounds, about once a month. It's only natural my fingerprints would be in there."
Rise from the ashes,4,480,Phoenix,
Rise from the ashes,4,481,Phoenix,"I only wish it were, Officer, but you see... your fingerprints were covered in blood!"
Rise from the ashes,4,482,Judge,Witness! What's the meaning of this!? Your bloodstained fingerprints were at the crime scene...!?
Rise from the ashes,4,483,Phoenix,"The blood was wiped away. However! A luminol test clearly revealed this! Well, Officer Marshall?"
Rise from the ashes,4,484,Marshall,... It seems to me... there ain't a person in this room with a head on his shoulders.
Rise from the ashes,4,485,Phoenix,!
Rise from the ashes,4,486,Edgeworth,"I take it you have an explanation then, Officer Marshall? About the ""bloodstained"" fingerprints?"
Rise from the ashes,4,487,Judge,"Very well, you may begin your testimony about your fingerprints, found at the scene of the crime!"
Rise from the ashes,4,488,Judge,"Hmm... The witness's explanation appears valid, although there's room for doubt."
Rise from the ashes,4,489,Marshall,"Life wouldn't be any fun without any doubt, pardner."
Rise from the ashes,4,490,Judge,The defense may now cross- examine the witness.
Rise from the ashes,4,491,Phoenix,"(This guy's hiding something, I can feel it! Now's my chance to prove it.)"
Rise from the ashes,4,492,Marshall,"Like I said, it's only natural for my fingerprints to be in that evidence room."
Rise from the ashes,4,493,Phoenix,"That's because you... how did you put it... ""pay your respects,"" once a month?"
Rise from the ashes,4,494,Marshall,"Yeah, that's right. That, and one more thing... That locker happens to be mine."
Rise from the ashes,4,495,Judge,What!? What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,4,496,Marshall,I mean what I said. That's the locker I used when I was a detective... the locker I still use. All that's in there now though is a heap of broken dreams.
Rise from the ashes,4,497,Phoenix,I see...
Rise from the ashes,4,498,Marshall,It'd be strange if my prints WEREN'T all over that locker.
Rise from the ashes,4,499,Phoenix,(Apparently his fingerprint data was never changed. He must have been using the fingerprint lock without even knowing it.)
Rise from the ashes,4,500,Marshall,One of them just happened to be at the same place as the bloodstained handprint.
Rise from the ashes,4,501,Phoenix,So then... What about the bloody handprint?
Rise from the ashes,4,502,Marshall,Wasn't mine. It's no mystery.
Rise from the ashes,4,503,Judge,Please explain.
Rise from the ashes,4,504,Marshall,My locker is covered with my fingerprints. It just so happened...
Rise from the ashes,4,505,Marshall,The murderer touched the locker where my fingerprint was by chance.
Rise from the ashes,4,506,Phoenix,The chances of that happening are a million to one!
Rise from the ashes,4,507,Marshall,"On the contrary, one could argue just the opposite. The chances of that not happening are a million to one! Get one thing straight, pardner. You ain't gonna get no reward for me with a mere fingerprint. You wanna know why?"
Rise from the ashes,4,508,Marshall,The bloodstain and the fingerprint are completely unrelated.
Rise from the ashes,4,509,Phoenix,Unrelated?
Rise from the ashes,4,510,Marshall,"They're as different as night and day. Kinda like ""cereal"" an' ""serial."" One's got to do with breakfast while the other's a type of murder."
Rise from the ashes,4,511,Judge,"He's right... although seemingly alike, they're totally different."
Rise from the ashes,4,512,Phoenix,(I don't see what homonyms have to do with this...)
Rise from the ashes,4,513,Marshall,Or didn't you know the murderer was wearing gloves?
Rise from the ashes,4,514,Phoenix,How do you know that!?
Rise from the ashes,4,515,Marshall,"I may be a loner, but I still do my job. I keep up on the reports."
Rise from the ashes,4,516,Edgeworth,"There was a bloodstain at the scene, thought to be left by the murderer."
Rise from the ashes,4,517,Phoenix,"That's right, it was found on Detective Gumshoe's locker."
Rise from the ashes,4,518,Edgeworth,"However, no fingerprints were detected on that handprint."
Rise from the ashes,4,519,Phoenix,"(Oh yeah, I think we tried that too.)"
Rise from the ashes,4,520,Judge,"Hmm...So that would mean... the murderer, wearing gloves, happened to place his hand on top of Officer Marshall's fingerprint."
Rise from the ashes,4,521,Marshall,That's the only logical conclusion.
Rise from the ashes,4,522,Marshall,"Too bad it wasn't me in that video, right, pardner?"
Rise from the ashes,4,523,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,524,Phoenix,What do you mean by that?
Rise from the ashes,4,525,Marshall,"You want to tie me to this crime, isn't that right, pardner?"
Rise from the ashes,4,526,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,4,527,Marshall,"If so, that video is the only direct evidence you have."
Rise from the ashes,4,528,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,529,Phoenix,But that video is next to useless! It's full of blind spots!
Rise from the ashes,4,530,Judge,Blind spots?
Rise from the ashes,4,531,Phoenix,"Places you can't see! The camera's panning back and forth, the floor isn't shown... If someone was familiar with the camera's position, he could leave the room without being caught on tape!"
Rise from the ashes,4,532,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,533,Edgeworth,"We don't have time for your speculations, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,4,534,Judge,"Well, Mr. Wright. If you can show us evidence in this video that indicates Officer Marshall was present, please do so now."
Rise from the ashes,4,535,Phoenix,"Very well. Allow me to point out your mistake, Officer Marshall!"
Rise from the ashes,4,536,Edgeworth,"Tread carefully, Mr. Wright, or you might wind up being the one making the mistake."
Rise from the ashes,4,537,Judge,"Now then, let's have another look at the video. Show us this incriminating evidence of the witness... Officer Jake Marshall!"
Rise from the ashes,4,538,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,539,Phoenix,"Bringing our attention back to the security camera... is a mistake I'm afraid you'll soon not forget, Officer Marshall."
Rise from the ashes,4,540,Marshall,... The days are short in Texas... and so are our tempers. Could you sum up what you have to say in eight words or less?
Rise from the ashes,4,541,Phoenix,Very well. You can clearly be seen in this video!
Rise from the ashes,4,542,Marshall,"Exactly eight words... Not bad, pardner."
Rise from the ashes,4,543,Phoenix,The key... lies in a certain locker shown in the video.
Rise from the ashes,4,544,Judge,See this locker that has a white cloth sticking out? This is the witness's locker.
Rise from the ashes,4,545,Phoenix,"Now then, let's rewind the video a bit."
Rise from the ashes,4,546,Judge,"Oh! The white cloth... it's gone! What's the meaning of this, Officer Marshall!?"
Rise from the ashes,4,547,Phoenix,"When the crime took place... The white cloth wasn't there. Then... it suddenly appeared! There's only one explanation: Officer Marshall! You were in the evidence room at the time of the crime! What's more, you opened your locker when the camera was turned away!"
Rise from the ashes,4,548,Judge,Order! Order! It would seem that's the only-
Rise from the ashes,4,549,Marshall,"Hold your horses! Sorry, pardner... but you got the wrong man."
Rise from the ashes,4,550,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,4,551,Marshall,So what if my locker was opened? That doesn't mean I'm the one who opened it!
Rise from the ashes,4,552,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,4,553,Marshall,"The murderer needed to hide something, so he opened a locker and stuck it in. It's not my fault he happened to choose mine!"
Rise from the ashes,4,554,Judge,...
Rise from the ashes,4,555,Marshall,... Why's everyone staring at me like I'm a wanted man?
Rise from the ashes,4,556,Phoenix,"(This guy isn't just playing dumb... He really doesn't know!) Uh, I hate to rain on your parade, but you're the only person who can open that particular locker."
Rise from the ashes,4,557,Marshall,Oh yeah? I call your bluff. You say I opened that locker... Now prove it!
Rise from the ashes,4,558,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,559,Marshall,"A... ""fingerprint"" sensor?"
Rise from the ashes,4,560,Phoenix,We talked about this earlier today. The lockers can only be opened by the detectives they belong to.
Rise from the ashes,4,561,Marshall,W-what kinda crazy talk is this!?
Rise from the ashes,4,562,Phoenix,"(Well, Detective Gumshoe did mention something about this...)"
Rise from the ashes,4,563,Gumshoe,"In any case, the locks aren't that obvious. There's even some people in the force that don't know about the fingerprint locks!"
Rise from the ashes,4,564,Phoenix,"So, sheriff! What do you have to say... in eight words or less?"
Rise from the ashes,4,565,Marshall,"I only got one word for you, pardner. NOOOOOO!!!"
Rise from the ashes,4,566,Judge,Order! Order! Order! Witness! Explain yourself!
Rise from the ashes,4,567,Marshall,"If this is a joke, it's the worst I've ever heard..."
Rise from the ashes,4,568,Phoenix,"I assure you this is no joke, Officer Marshall. Now then, please tell us what you were doing in the evidence room at the time of the crime?"
Rise from the ashes,4,569,Marshall,...
Rise from the ashes,4,570,Judge,OlÃ©! Please answer the question!
Rise from the ashes,4,571,Phoenix,"(What is he now, a bullfighter?) That's alright, Officer Marshall. I believe we can figure the rest out from here."
Rise from the ashes,4,572,Judge,We can?
Rise from the ashes,4,573,Phoenix,"Have a look at these floor plans. There is no place for someone to hide in the evidence room. Yet, Officer Meekins didn't see Officer Marshall."
Rise from the ashes,4,574,Judge,"If that's so, then... where was the witness?"
Rise from the ashes,4,575,Edgeworth,It seems Mr. Wright has an answer.
Rise from the ashes,4,576,Phoenix,(That's right. The only possible conclusion!)
Rise from the ashes,4,577,Judge,Well then? Let's hear it. Where was Officer Marshall at the time of the crime?
Rise from the ashes,4,578,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,579,Phoenix,Officer Marshall was standing right here!
Rise from the ashes,4,580,Judge,"There? But that's... That's where the victim, Detective Goodman, was!"
Rise from the ashes,4,581,Phoenix,"Correct... unless the man wasn't Detective Goodman. I believe the ""victim"" in the video is... Officer Marshall! It was you, dressed up like Detective Goodman!"
Rise from the ashes,4,582,Edgeworth,
Rise from the ashes,4,583,Edgeworth,"But that's preposterous! Officer Meekins witnessed the detective at the crime scene! Once he saw the man's face, he'd know for sure!"
Rise from the ashes,4,584,Phoenix,
Rise from the ashes,4,585,Phoenix,"May I point out though, that Officer Meekins did not know Detective Goodman. He also testified about the man's reaction when confronted."
Rise from the ashes,4,586,Meekins,"When I entered the evidence room, I asked him to show his card, sir!"
Rise from the ashes,4,587,Phoenix,Yes? And how did Detective Goodman respond?
Rise from the ashes,4,588,Meekins,He suddenly pulled a knife on me!
Rise from the ashes,4,589,Phoenix,"Something about the Officer's story puzzled me. If the man had his ID card, why didn't he just show it?"
Rise from the ashes,4,590,Judge,"Yes, he would have needed it to enter the evidence room, so he must have been carrying it."
Rise from the ashes,4,591,Phoenix,The answer is simple. He couldn't show it.
Rise from the ashes,4,592,Edgeworth,!
Rise from the ashes,4,593,Phoenix,"As you can see, Detective Goodman's picture is on his ID card."
Rise from the ashes,4,594,Judge,"Oh, I get it."
Rise from the ashes,4,595,Phoenix,"If he showed that, his cover would have been blown! Officer Meekins would have realized the man wasn't Detective Goodman. Do you have anything to say to this, Officer Marshall?"
Rise from the ashes,4,596,Marshall,"... You've got quite an imagination, pardner. We got a term for that. It's called ""circumstantial evidence."""
Rise from the ashes,4,597,Phoenix,Circumstantial evidence...? (He's still denying it!)
Rise from the ashes,4,598,Marshall,You're gonna have to do better than that to break a detective. Unless you have hard evidence proving I dressed up as the victim...
Rise from the ashes,4,599,Judge,Hmm... I can't say I particularly care for your uncooperative disposition...
Rise from the ashes,4,600,Marshall,"I can't say I care for your beard, but you don't see me complainin'."
Rise from the ashes,4,601,Judge,"Well, Mr. Wright? Do you have any evidence? Any evidence proving beyond the shadow of a doubt that Officer Marshall dressed up as the victim?"
Rise from the ashes,4,602,Phoenix,Well... (Who am I kidding? I don't have anything like that...)
Rise from the ashes,4,603,Marshall,"I can see the fear in your eyes, pardner. Seems you're the one who couldn't take the desert heat!"
Rise from the ashes,4,604,Phoenix,Ack! (This can't be happening! It's so obvious he's the one! What can I do...?)
Rise from the ashes,4,605,Edgeworth,... Hmph. It looks like your lack of experience has finally been exposed.
Rise from the ashes,4,606,Phoenix,!
Rise from the ashes,4,607,Edgeworth,"I'll pass onto you what someone told me when I was just starting out. When you've run into a wall with no place to go, return to the basics."
Rise from the ashes,4,608,Phoenix,"The basics... (For me, that would be what Mia used to tell me!)"
Rise from the ashes,4,609,Mia,Nick! Try thinking outside of the box!
Rise from the ashes,4,610,Phoenix,(I shouldn't look for proof that Officer Marshall was in disguise... but rather I should look for evidence that came about because he was in disguise!)
Rise from the ashes,4,611,Edgeworth,Why do you think this locker was opened in the first place?
Rise from the ashes,4,612,Judge,What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,4,613,Edgeworth,"There's no reason for Officer Marshall to open his locker at the time of the crime. Yet he did, despite the chance that it might be discovered later as it has been."
Rise from the ashes,4,614,Phoenix,(Which means he didn't originally plan to open his locker...!)
Rise from the ashes,4,615,Judge,"According to the defense's argument, Officer Jake Marshall dressed up as Detective Goodman at the time of the crime. Then, after the crime was ""committed,"" he opened his own locker for some unknown reason."
Rise from the ashes,4,616,Edgeworth,"The fact that a white ""cloth"" is sticking out of the locker seems to indicate that he opened it in order to put the cloth inside."
Rise from the ashes,4,617,Judge,So... just what exactly is this piece of cloth?
Rise from the ashes,4,618,Phoenix,"Perhaps... Perhaps the video is the key to all our unanswered questions. (I don't have any evidence, so this video's my only shot!)"
Rise from the ashes,4,619,Marshall,...
Rise from the ashes,4,620,Judge,"Very well. Let's take yet another look at the security tape. After commiting the crime, the witness opened the locker to put away the white cloth. Please show us why the witness had to open his locker!"
Rise from the ashes,4,621,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,622,Phoenix,"For some reason, you disguised yourself as Detective Goodman, and entered the evidence room. I don't know what that reason was... yet."
Rise from the ashes,4,623,Marshall,"""Yet""?"
Rise from the ashes,4,624,Phoenix,"However, something unexpected happened. Officer Meekins barged in on you. When asked to show your ID card, you pulled a knife on him. However! Officer Meekins panicked, and the white coat you were wearing was soiled with blood!"
Rise from the ashes,4,625,Judge,A bloody white coat...
Rise from the ashes,4,626,Phoenix,"You couldn't just walk out like that, so you hid the coat in your locker."
Rise from the ashes,4,627,Marshall,"... Not bad, huh ""pardner""?"
Rise from the ashes,4,628,Judge,"Now then, Officer Marshall. Are you ready to tell us the truth?"
Rise from the ashes,4,629,Marshall,"Looks like I underestimated y'all. I hope you're happy now, Mr. Edgeworth."
Rise from the ashes,4,630,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,4,631,Marshall,"Two years ago... if you were only half as persistent then as you are today, we all wouldn't have to be here, now would we?"
Rise from the ashes,4,632,Phoenix,Officer Marshall! Tell the court what you did... all of it.
Rise from the ashes,4,633,Marshall,Alright. It seems the time has come.
Rise from the ashes,4,634,Judge,"So the supposed ""victim"" was really you..."
Rise from the ashes,4,635,Edgeworth,"But there's one thing I still don't understand. Large quantities of blood traces were found on the floor of the evidence room. If no one was murdered, then how could that be?"
Rise from the ashes,4,636,Marshall,Officer Meekins managed to cut his own hand. My guess is he's the donor.
Rise from the ashes,4,637,Phoenix,(It looked like too much blood for that...)
Rise from the ashes,4,638,Marshall,I had to do it that day. I couldn't just stand by and let it die.
Rise from the ashes,4,639,Phoenix,"When you say ""it,"" you mean..."
Rise from the ashes,4,640,Marshall,"Do you even have to ask, pardner?"
Rise from the ashes,4,641,Phoenix,(The SL-9 Incident...)
Rise from the ashes,4,642,Edgeworth,Two years have passed since that case was closed. It was going to completely end with the transferal that day.
Rise from the ashes,4,643,Marshall,Not if I have anything to do with it. That incident's not over!
Rise from the ashes,4,644,Phoenix,But what did you hope to accomplish by sneaking into the evidence room?
Rise from the ashes,4,645,Marshall,"When a case is closed, only the detective who was in charge of it can look through the evidence. I wanted to have a look at it myself one more time... no matter what the cost. I don't care what anyone says, pardner. That case is mine."
Rise from the ashes,4,646,Phoenix,(But Officer Marshall wasn't in charge of that investigation. Why does he care so much about it?)
Rise from the ashes,4,647,Marshall,That day was my last chance. That's why I...
Rise from the ashes,4,648,Marshall,I stole the detective's ID and dressed like him. I planned to take out the evidence.
Rise from the ashes,4,649,Phoenix,Why did you disguise yourself as Detective Goodman?
Rise from the ashes,4,650,Marshall,"If I didn't make it look like Goodman was carrying out the evidence transferal... I'd be arrested for stealing evidence, which wouldn't get me anywhere."
Rise from the ashes,4,651,Edgeworth,So you did it to fool the security camera.
Rise from the ashes,4,652,Judge,And the detective's ID card?
Rise from the ashes,4,653,Marshall,I stole that the morning of the incident.
Rise from the ashes,4,654,Phoenix,(So that really was why Goodman started filling out that lost item report.)
Rise from the ashes,4,655,Marshall,I returned his ID card. I left it on the floor in the Prosecutor's Office parking lot.
Rise from the ashes,4,656,Phoenix,(The ID card I found was left there by Officer Marshall!)
Rise from the ashes,4,657,Edgeworth,So essentially... You managed to succeed despite your lack of foresight.
Rise from the ashes,4,658,Marshall,What do you mean... pardner?
Rise from the ashes,4,659,Edgeworth,"I mean the fingerprint- activated lock, of course. No matter how well you disguise yourself, you can't change your fingerprints. Normally, that locker shouldn't have opened."
Rise from the ashes,4,660,Phoenix,(So it opened because a rubber glove was stuck in the door by chance...? Then Detective Goodman must have opened the locker before Officer Marshall!)
Rise from the ashes,4,661,Marshall,I wasn't expecting Officer Meekins. I knocked him out...
Rise from the ashes,4,662,Phoenix,You pulled a knife on Officer Meekins and tried to drive him off?
Rise from the ashes,4,663,Marshall,Let's just say I was a little surprised. I only planned on being in the evidence room for no more than five minutes. I didn't think anyone would actually come in during that short time.
Rise from the ashes,4,664,Judge,Officer Meekins... certainly is a one-in-a- million type of person. Mistaking a detective for an intruder and demanding to be shown his ID...
Rise from the ashes,4,665,Edgeworth,I'll have to think a little more about his raise this year...
Rise from the ashes,4,666,Phoenix,(When did Edgeworth get so much influence...?)
Rise from the ashes,4,667,Marshall,"Anyway, he threw himself at me, and I ended up cutting him slightly. I'm sorry it had to turn out that way... with me knocking him out and everything."
Rise from the ashes,4,668,Phoenix,"By the way, what happened to your knife?"
Rise from the ashes,4,669,Marshall,"Oh, you mean this one?"
Rise from the ashes,4,670,Phoenix,... (I don't know what to say...)
Rise from the ashes,4,671,Judge,"Hmm... So, what happened next?"
Rise from the ashes,4,672,Marshall,and managed to escape. I knew which areas wouldn't be caught on the camera.
Rise from the ashes,4,673,Phoenix,So you did your research beforehand.
Rise from the ashes,4,674,Marshall,"Those who go into the desert unprepared don't live long, pardner. I didn't think it would make a difference though. The security tape is erased every six hours. If all had gone as planned, no footage would have been left."
Rise from the ashes,4,675,Edgeworth,However... You bloodied your coat in your struggle with Officer Meekins.
Rise from the ashes,4,676,Marshall,"If someone was in the security room when I came out, the jig would have been up. I opened my locker and stashed it in there."
Rise from the ashes,4,677,Phoenix,What was Officer Meekins doing during that time?
Rise from the ashes,4,678,Marshall,What else? He was sleeping like a baby.
Rise from the ashes,4,679,Judge,"So what you're saying is, on that day..."
Rise from the ashes,4,680,Marshall,There wasn't any murder in the evidence room at 5:15.
Rise from the ashes,4,681,Phoenix,But the blood found at the scene certainly indicates a crime took place!
Rise from the ashes,4,682,Marshall,"What are you, blind? The ""victim"" shown on that tape is me, and I'm not dead yet, pardner."
Rise from the ashes,4,683,Edgeworth,"So, you stole the evidence from the locker?"
Rise from the ashes,4,684,Marshall,"Actually... no, I didn't."
Rise from the ashes,4,685,Edgeworth,Why not?
Rise from the ashes,4,686,Marshall,"When I opened the locker, the evidence was already gone."
Rise from the ashes,4,687,Judge,What!? Mr. Edgeworth. Where is that evidence?
Rise from the ashes,4,688,Edgeworth,"It's still missing, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,4,689,Phoenix,(Detective Goodman's locker was already empty... Someone else stole the evidence!)
Rise from the ashes,4,690,Phoenix,Officer Marshall. May I ask you one thing?
Rise from the ashes,4,691,Marshall,"Fire away, pardner. It's a free country. Just remember, I'm also free to decide whether or not to answer."
Rise from the ashes,4,692,Phoenix,"Why did you do this? Stealing a detective's ID, injuring a police officer... This is no small offense!"
Rise from the ashes,4,693,Edgeworth,"Moreover, you're an officer yourself. This will have serious consequences. It can't just be forgiven with a simple cut in salary."
Rise from the ashes,4,694,Phoenix,(Not that salary cuts are ever a valid solution...)
Rise from the ashes,4,695,Marshall,... Like I said. This isn't your case. This one is mine. And I'll do anything it takes to get an answer I'm satisfied with.
Rise from the ashes,4,696,Judge,Hmm... The witness has an unusual amount of zeal. Let's hear more.
Rise from the ashes,4,697,Marshall,I can't just forget the SL-9 Incident... You know why?
Rise from the ashes,4,698,Phoenix,
Rise from the ashes,4,699,Phoenix,"But that case was solved two years ago, wasn't it?"
Rise from the ashes,4,700,Judge,That's the reason the evidence was stored in the evidence room.
Rise from the ashes,4,701,Edgeworth,"Joe Darke was convicted for those crimes. One thing I can say for sure, he deserved his sentence."
Rise from the ashes,4,702,Judge,"I remember the Joe Darke case... It involved serial murders, didn't it?"
Rise from the ashes,4,703,Marshall,"I don't intend to complain about how it turned out, but there's something that still bothers me. Something went down at that trial. Something no one will talk about."
Rise from the ashes,4,704,Judge,What happened?
Rise from the ashes,4,705,Marshall,I don't know. That's what I'm trying to find out.
Rise from the ashes,4,706,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,4,707,Phoenix,(Why is he so concerned with that incident? Maybe I should present him with what I think his real reason is...)
Rise from the ashes,4,708,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,709,Phoenix,"Officer Marshall, I think I understand. I think I know why you care so much about the SL-9 Incident."
Rise from the ashes,4,710,Marshall,"Sounds like you've been sipping too much cactus juice, pardner."
Rise from the ashes,4,711,Phoenix,"I have the SL-9 Incident file here. The name ""Marshall"" is mentioned in here..."
Rise from the ashes,4,712,Marshall,!
Rise from the ashes,4,713,Phoenix,"in a list of murder victims. ""Neil Marshall""... Are you related to this man?"
Rise from the ashes,4,714,Edgeworth,Neil Marshall...?
Rise from the ashes,4,715,Marshall,"Yeah, I'm sure you've heard the name. Two years ago... he received the same lousy prosecutor award you got."
Rise from the ashes,4,716,Judge,What!? A prosecutor...?
Rise from the ashes,4,717,Phoenix,(He must be talking about the King of Prosecutors award.)
Rise from the ashes,4,718,Edgeworth,Now I remember... Prosecutor Neil Marshall. He handled the SL-9 case before I did.
Rise from the ashes,4,719,Marshall,That's right. He was killed... and the case fell into your hands.
Rise from the ashes,4,720,Judge,But what's his relation to you...?
Rise from the ashes,4,721,Marshall,"He was my brother. He was investigating the murders with Damon Gant, Chief Detective at the time. The group of detectives I was part of worked under them. We were desperate to prosecute the killer. Joe Darke... My brother fought Darke and was killed. That was the first time Darke left behind any evidence. That was all we needed. He was arraigned and incarcerated. The case was finally closed... at least, according to the public records."
Rise from the ashes,4,722,Judge,What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,4,723,Marshall,My brother couldn't have been killed by Joe Darke. I knew my brother better than anyone... No one could have beaten him in a fight.
Rise from the ashes,4,724,Edgeworth,And that's it? That's your reason for your insane actions?
Rise from the ashes,4,725,Marshall,"There's more to my brother's death than what the records say. No matter how much you try to hide it, you can't fool me."
Rise from the ashes,4,726,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,4,727,Judge,Well... at least one thing's for certain. Now we know what happened at the Police Department on the day of the crime.
Rise from the ashes,4,728,Edgeworth,"That was the last day the SL-9 case could be reopened. Not satisfied with its resolution, Officer Marshall planned to steal the evidence."
Rise from the ashes,4,729,Phoenix,"Disguising himself as Detective Goodman, he entered the evidence room. Officer Meekins confronted him, so he rendered him unconscious and fled."
Rise from the ashes,4,730,Edgeworth,"Yes, this mystery has finally been cleared up. No murder took place at the Police Department that day!"
Rise from the ashes,4,731,Phoenix,!
Rise from the ashes,4,732,Edgeworth,The things that happen by chance never cease to amaze... At exactly the same time as the murder at the Prosecutor's Office... this fake murder was going on at the Police Department.
Rise from the ashes,4,733,Phoenix,(Chance...? It's got to be more than just that...)
Rise from the ashes,4,734,Judge,"So if no one was murdered at the Police Department on the day of the crime, that means the murder in the Prosecutor's Office's parking lot was the real one."
Rise from the ashes,4,735,Edgeworth,"Which, in turn, means... only one person could have committed the crime: Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye."
Rise from the ashes,4,736,Phoenix,
Rise from the ashes,4,737,Phoenix,B-but wait! A verdict wasn't reached in yesterday's trial!
Rise from the ashes,4,738,Edgeworth,
Rise from the ashes,4,739,Edgeworth,Which is why we examined the incident at the Police Department today.
Rise from the ashes,4,740,Phoenix,But...!
Rise from the ashes,4,741,Edgeworth,There's only one reason the defendant was not convicted yesterday: there yet remained the mystery of the simultaneous murder at the Police Department.
Rise from the ashes,4,742,Marshall,"It seems to me... this boy's got the draw on you, pardner."
Rise from the ashes,4,743,Edgeworth,"All the mysteries at the Police Department have been uncovered. No contradictions remain. The murder took place at the Prosecutor's Office! The only suspect is Lana Skye. There were no errors in the testimony of the witness, Angel Starr! If you have a response... make it one word or less."
Rise from the ashes,4,744,Phoenix,... ARRRGHHHH!!!
Rise from the ashes,4,745,Edgeworth,I rest my case.
Rise from the ashes,4,746,Judge,It seems this trial has reached its conclusion. There's no room for doubt.
Rise from the ashes,4,747,Edgeworth,"Well done, Mr. Wright. Thanks to you, I didn't need to waste my time... disproving the alleged ""murder"" at the Police Department."
Rise from the ashes,4,748,Phoenix,(There's no doubt what I proved today is true... The apparent murder on the security camera's tape really was fake! But I didn't realize... that would end up proving Lana guilty!)
Rise from the ashes,4,749,Judge,"Now then, the time for the verdict has arrived. This court finds the defendant..."
Rise from the ashes,4,750,Ema,Y-your Honor! Wait!
Rise from the ashes,4,751,Phoenix,Ema!
Rise from the ashes,4,752,Ema,The defense has an objection. A scientific objection! Right?
Rise from the ashes,4,753,Phoenix,"What do you mean, ""right?"""
Rise from the ashes,4,754,Judge,Mr. Wright. Are you this girl's guardian?
Rise from the ashes,4,755,Phoenix,"Your Honor! Oh, uh... in a sense..."
Rise from the ashes,4,756,Ema,"Please, Your Honor. All I'm asking is for a minute of your time! Please hear me out! Mr. Edgeworth, please..."
Rise from the ashes,4,757,Edgeworth,... I don't want to leave any loose ends. You want a minute? I'll give you three.
Rise from the ashes,4,758,Ema,"I... I was kind of in shock. I mean, finding out that the SL-9 incident referred to the Joe Darke Killings!"
Rise from the ashes,4,759,Phoenix,(Now that she mentions it... the names of both Skye sisters were in that file.)
Rise from the ashes,4,760,Ema,"But that's when I figured it out. I mean, what Officer Marshall was trying to do that day... So I knew his fingerprint had nothing to do with the crime. That left only one thing... the other handprint!"
Rise from the ashes,4,761,Edgeworth,You mean the traces of blood found on Detective Gumshoe's locker...
Rise from the ashes,4,762,Judge,"But no fingerprints were found on it, right?"
Rise from the ashes,4,763,Ema,"No, but I figured if I examined it scientifically... I'd be sure to find a clue! So I ran over there and looked at it again!"
Rise from the ashes,4,764,Phoenix,! So did you find something?
Rise from the ashes,4,765,Ema,Um... No!
Rise from the ashes,4,766,Phoenix,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,4,767,Ema,Sorry. I guess I'm not much of a scientific investigator after all.
Rise from the ashes,4,768,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,4,769,Ema,...
Rise from the ashes,4,770,Phoenix,Um... Is that all?
Rise from the ashes,4,771,Ema,Please don't be mad. I'm just a high school student!
Rise from the ashes,4,772,Phoenix,(And I'm just an attorney...)
Rise from the ashes,4,773,Ema,"But Mr. Wright! Those traces of blood are the only clue we have! If we can't find something wrong with them... Please, Mr. Wright. You're a professional. If anyone can save Lana, it's you!"
Rise from the ashes,4,774,Phoenix,Me? Oh boy...
Rise from the ashes,4,775,Judge,"Time's up. Now then, Mr. Wright. With regard to the incident at the Police Department... Does any reasonable doubt remain?"
Rise from the ashes,4,776,Phoenix,Um...
Rise from the ashes,4,777,Edgeworth,"It appears the defense is troubled by the other blood mark. Looking at the floor plans, a handprint was discovered around here. Is there a problem with this?"
Rise from the ashes,4,778,Ema,"Mr. Wright! I'm sorry I can't be of more use... But still! If you can't find anything wrong with that blood mark, Lana will be..."
Rise from the ashes,4,779,Judge,"Please answer my question, Mr. Wright. We don't have all day."
Rise from the ashes,4,780,Phoenix,"Y-yes, Your Honor. (If ever I've needed to concentrate, it's now! What could be wrong with that handprint on Detective Gumshoe's locker? Could there be something I'm missing...?)"
Rise from the ashes,4,781,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,782,Phoenix,This handprint left at the crime scene... clearly shows a contradiction!
Rise from the ashes,4,783,Edgeworth,"The only thing that seems clear is you're grasping, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,4,784,Judge,You've been staring pretty intently at those floor plans. Tell me... is there a problem with them?
Rise from the ashes,4,785,Phoenix,"... (Yes, this is strange...!) Take a good look at these floor plans. Something is missing."
Rise from the ashes,4,786,Edgeworth,"""Missing""...? You mean, something hasn't been drawn on there?"
Rise from the ashes,4,787,Phoenix,"Yes. Something that, when drawn, will completely change the meaning of the blood mark!"
Rise from the ashes,4,788,Judge,"Let us pray the defense isn't simply trying to buy time. Very well, Mr. Wright!"
Rise from the ashes,4,789,Phoenix,(With all this evidence here... there's got to be something I can use!)
Rise from the ashes,4,790,Judge,The question is... which item can prove something is missing in the floor plans?
Rise from the ashes,4,791,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,792,Marshall,What about that piece of plywood?
Rise from the ashes,4,793,Phoenix,"The Blue Badger! Mascot of the police force! Defender of truth, guardian of proof!"
Rise from the ashes,4,794,Edgeworth,"Explain yourself, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,4,795,Phoenix,Please look at the floor plans of the crime scene. The Blue Badger is not here.
Rise from the ashes,4,796,Marshall,So?
Rise from the ashes,4,797,Phoenix,So watch what happens when we put him in. This is where he was dancing at the time of the crime. Well...?
Rise from the ashes,4,798,Judge,Well... what?
Rise from the ashes,4,799,Edgeworth,! *gasp!*
Rise from the ashes,4,800,Phoenix,That's right. So long as the Blue Badger is dancing here... it would be impossible... to place a handprint at this spot on the locker!
Rise from the ashes,4,801,Marshall,Whaaaaat!?
Rise from the ashes,4,802,Judge,So that means... Uh... just exactly what does that mean!?
Rise from the ashes,4,803,Phoenix,It means it can't be done!
Rise from the ashes,4,804,Judge,What are you saying? Blood traces were undeniably found on that locker!
Rise from the ashes,4,805,Phoenix,"Don't look at me, I didn't put it there!"
Rise from the ashes,4,806,Ema,Mr. Wright! Think it through scientifically!
Rise from the ashes,4,807,Phoenix,Ema!
Rise from the ashes,4,808,Ema,"On that afternoon... Officer Meekins was the one who brought the Blue Badger to the evidence room, right? After he put it down, it would be impossible to leave a handprint on that locker."
Rise from the ashes,4,809,Phoenix,...! So that must mean this blood mark... was left there before the Blue Badger was brought in...?
Rise from the ashes,4,810,Judge,Just one moment! I will not allow such farfetched balderdash in my courtroom!
Rise from the ashes,4,811,Phoenix,"It may sound farfetched, Your Honor... but it's the only possible explanation! On February 21st... in the Police Department's evidence room... blood was spilled not once, but twice!"
Rise from the ashes,4,812,Edgeworth,B-but how...!
Rise from the ashes,4,813,Phoenix,"One time was captured on this tape, taken by the security camera. Officer Meekins cut his hand, from which a trivial amount of blood fell. The problem is... the ""other"" time. Someone bled prior to the struggle shown on this tape. It had to have been... Detective Goodman, when he was really murdered!"
Rise from the ashes,4,814,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,815,Edgeworth,That's ridiculous! I refute you!
Rise from the ashes,4,816,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,817,Phoenix,The murder portrayed in the security tape has been proven to be a fake. However! That does not explain the blood mark found on the locker!
Rise from the ashes,4,818,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,819,Edgeworth,"So then... assuming this ""murder"" you purport really happened. When did it take place!? I demand you show evidence that proves it occurred!"
Rise from the ashes,4,820,Phoenix,(When did the first incident occur...)
Rise from the ashes,4,821,Judge,"To surmise, the defense claims that... prior to Officer Meekins being cut by Jake Marshall, who was disguised as Detective Goodman, another ""incident"" took place in that evidence room."
Rise from the ashes,4,822,Phoenix,The blood mark on the locker proves this.
Rise from the ashes,4,823,Judge,"Very well. Then tell us... When did this ""first"" incident occur? Proof must be presented."
Rise from the ashes,4,824,Phoenix,(Proof that shows when the murder took place... There's only one piece of evidence that can show that!)
Rise from the ashes,4,825,Judge,"Now then. Will the defense please present its evidence? What shows when the ""first"" crime took place?"
Rise from the ashes,4,826,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,827,Phoenix,"If the crime took place inside the evidence room, then the perpetrator would had to have entered the room. In order to do so, an ID card is required."
Rise from the ashes,4,828,Judge,An ID card... Oh! The ID Card Record!
Rise from the ashes,4,829,Phoenix,Officer Meekins brought the Blue Badger panel into the evidence room at...
Rise from the ashes,4,830,Judge,"Let's see here... 4:50 PM. If the crime took place before that time, then it would be... 4:40 PM... Ah! AAAAAAAHHH! M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-Miles Edgeworth! Just what have you done!?"
Rise from the ashes,4,831,Marshall,"I never figured you had nerve, boy."
Rise from the ashes,4,832,Edgeworth,"Put off the act, witness. It doesn't take a lot of thought to figure out it couldn't have been me."
Rise from the ashes,4,833,Marshall,"Hmm... Nope, I ain't gettin' it..."
Rise from the ashes,4,834,Judge,Hmm... I'm afraid I don't understand either.
Rise from the ashes,4,835,Edgeworth,"It's clear from the luminol test that blood was there. However, when the ""second"" crime took place... both Officer Meekins and Officer Marshall failed to notice the blood."
Rise from the ashes,4,836,Phoenix,That means... the blood from the first crime was wiped away... by the real murderer.
Rise from the ashes,4,837,Edgeworth,"I would have had just ten minutes to murder the victim, carry his body away, and clean up the blood... Unfortunately that's physically impossible."
Rise from the ashes,4,838,Judge,That would mean... the crime must have taken place before Mr. Edgeworth entered the evidence room.
Rise from the ashes,4,839,Phoenix,"Let's look at the chart again. There's only one other card number remaining: ""7777777""!"
Rise from the ashes,4,840,Marshall,Talk about a lucky number...
Rise from the ashes,4,841,Judge,But wait... That doesn't make sense! How could Officer Goodman have entered the evidence room?
Rise from the ashes,4,842,Phoenix,"Since there's no record of his card being used beforehand... he must have entered along with the real murderer. That's the only plausible explanation. He went in with ""7777777""!"
Rise from the ashes,4,843,Judge,"Mr. Edgeworth! Please look into this ASAP! Find out whose ID number is ""sevensevensevensevensevensevensevenseven""!"
Rise from the ashes,4,844,Edgeworth,"That's one ""seven"" too many, Your Honor. Unfortunately... I'm unable to look up the owner of that ID card. At least, at present."
Rise from the ashes,4,845,Phoenix,What!?
Rise from the ashes,4,846,Marshall,"Explain yourself, son."
Rise from the ashes,4,847,Edgeworth,"The ID number ""7777777"" belongs to someone with a rank of Captain or higher... Someone who is a so-called ""executive officer."" We don't have the authority to inquire into such a person's identity."
Rise from the ashes,4,848,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,849,Phoenix,But that's ridiculous! Just how...
Rise from the ashes,4,850,Edgeworth,"I'm not finished talking, Mr. Wright. There is one situation in which we can be granted such authority."
Rise from the ashes,4,851,Judge,If an official charge filed against an executive is accepted.
Rise from the ashes,4,852,Phoenix,"An ""official charge""..."
Rise from the ashes,4,853,Marshall,"You're all alike, aren't you? With your ""cover-ups"" and your ""forgeries""... That's how the Prosecutor's Office operates!"
Rise from the ashes,4,854,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,855,Edgeworth,"I take pride in my work, Officer Marshall. I would appreciate it if you would keep your slander to yourself."
Rise from the ashes,4,856,Marshall,"""Slander,"" is it? Okay. Let me ask a question."
Rise from the ashes,4,857,Edgeworth,Yes?
Rise from the ashes,4,858,Marshall,"No, not to you. To her, the defendant sitting over there. Your own little ""executive."""
Rise from the ashes,4,859,Phoenix,(L-Lana?)
Rise from the ashes,4,860,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,4,861,Edgeworth,"Don't be stupid. She's been charged with murder. Of course we've looked up her ID number... and it's not ""7777777."""
Rise from the ashes,4,862,Marshall,"Don't play me for a fool, pardner. That's not what I want to ask. All I want to know is one thing... about that incident."
Rise from the ashes,4,863,Judge,The SL-9 Incident?
Rise from the ashes,4,864,Marshall,"Answer me this, Chief Prosecutor! In that trial two years ago... Did you really only use legitimate evidence!?"
Rise from the ashes,4,865,Edgeworth,"Do you need the witness to repeat his question, Chief Prosecutor?"
Rise from the ashes,4,866,Lana,"I heard him fine, Mr. Edgeworth."
Rise from the ashes,4,867,Edgeworth,"Two years ago... I was in charge of the prosecution for that trial. At the time, we..."
Rise from the ashes,4,868,Lana,Occasionally... we felt the powerlessness of the law. At least... I did.
Rise from the ashes,4,869,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,4,870,Ema,L-Lana...
Rise from the ashes,4,871,Lana,"I became a prosecutor in order to suppress crime with the law. But before I realized it, we were the ones being suppressed by the law."
Rise from the ashes,4,872,Judge,Defendant! Just what are you saying!?
Rise from the ashes,4,873,Marshall,"I'll ask you again, Chief Prosecutor. During that trial two years ago... did you really present all the evidence in court? Can you look me, an investigator in that crime, in the eye and say that you did?"
Rise from the ashes,4,874,Judge,Chief Prosecutor! You didn't...
Rise from the ashes,4,875,Lana,"... I don't have to, Officer Marshall."
Rise from the ashes,4,876,Edgeworth,! Why don't you answer him!?
Rise from the ashes,4,877,Lana,Drastic crimes require drastic measures... That's just the way it is. We did what we had to... in order for him to get the verdict he deserved.
Rise from the ashes,4,878,Ema,But Lana!
Rise from the ashes,4,879,Lana,"Even if it involved ""forging"" evidence."
Rise from the ashes,4,880,Marshall,See? That's what I'm talking about.
Rise from the ashes,4,881,Edgeworth,No... NNNNOOOOOOO!!!
Rise from the ashes,4,882,Judge,Order! Order! Order! ORDERRRRR!!!
Rise from the ashes,5,0,Ema,"I'm so sorry, Mr. Wright. I'm sorry for what my sister said..."
Rise from the ashes,5,1,Lana,Drastic crimes require drastic measures... That's just the way it is. We did what we had to... in order for him to get the verdict he deserved.
Rise from the ashes,5,2,Ema,"I... didn't know. I never knew that the ""SL-9 Incident"" was just another name for... the ""Joe Darke Killings."""
Rise from the ashes,5,3,Phoenix,(Sounds like everyone's heard about these killings but me...)
Rise from the ashes,5,4,Ema,Lana wanted Darke convicted so badly! That's why she used me... That's why she used what happened to me.
Rise from the ashes,5,5,Phoenix,"What do you mean, ""what happened"" to you?"
Rise from the ashes,5,6,Ema,"It's all there in the file... Joe Darke's last victim was Prosecutor Neil Marshall. When he murdered Officer Marshall's brother, he left behind an incriminating piece of evidence."
Rise from the ashes,5,7,Phoenix,"But what did you have to do with those killings, Ema?"
Rise from the ashes,5,8,Ema,"On the night Prosecutor Neil Marshall was murdered, Joe Darke... tried to kill me."
Rise from the ashes,5,9,Phoenix,What? He tried to kill you!?
Rise from the ashes,5,10,Ema,Officer Marshall's brother... Neil... was only trying to save me.
Rise from the ashes,5,11,Phoenix,So that means you...
Rise from the ashes,5,12,Ema,Yes. I was a witness in the Joe Darke trial.
Rise from the ashes,5,13,Phoenix,(I didn't see that one coming!)
Rise from the ashes,5,14,Ema,"It happened two years ago... It was right about this time of the year, too. There was a terrible thunder storm that day... Unusual for the season. I was alone in my sister's office. We were planning to eat dinner together once she finished her work. Then suddenly... This terrifying man came bursting into the office!"
Rise from the ashes,5,15,Phoenix,Joe Darke...
Rise from the ashes,5,16,Ema,"It seemed like he was running from someone. He pulled out a knife and screamed at me. I didn't know what was going on. Just then, Prosecutor Marshall showed up."
Rise from the ashes,5,17,Phoenix,(Jake Marshall's brother...)
Rise from the ashes,5,18,Ema,"Joe Darke tried to take me hostage, but before he could... Mr. Marshall tackled him. Then..."
Rise from the ashes,5,19,Phoenix,What happened?
Rise from the ashes,5,20,Ema,"I-I'll never forget it! Lightning struck, and the lights went out. Suddenly... a bolt of lightning flashed outside the window, lighting up the office for an instant. What I saw then burned a permanent picture in my mind. I... I can still see it now..."
Rise from the ashes,5,21,Phoenix,(A permanent picture...?)
Rise from the ashes,5,22,Ema,I don't remember the moment when Darke stabbed Mr. Marshall.
Rise from the ashes,5,23,Phoenix,"So you weren't able to testify about that? No, I was only asked about when I was attacked. That must be why Lana... why she ""made up"" the crime."
Rise from the ashes,5,24,Phoenix,"Made it up? You mean, provided bogus evidence?"
Rise from the ashes,5,25,Ema,"The Prosecutor's Office wanted that guilty verdict so badly. Lana forged the evidence, and Mr. Edgeworth used it..."
Rise from the ashes,5,26,Phoenix,Edgeworth!?
Rise from the ashes,5,27,Ema,"Yes. But I'm sure he didn't know anything about it! He couldn't have known he was being given false evidence. Even so... that's when it all started. The rumors about Mr. Edgeworth, I mean. It's all my fault... If I could have just testified properly, none of this would have happened!"
Rise from the ashes,5,28,Phoenix,(So it's true. Even though he may not have known it... Edgeworth really was involved in falsifying evidence!)
Rise from the ashes,5,29,Ema,"After that case ended, Lana was never the same. She became cold, like she is today."
Rise from the ashes,5,30,Phoenix,(She must not have been able to face up to what she did... Especially not to Ema.)
Rise from the ashes,5,31,Phoenix,What did you see in the instant that crime occurred?
Rise from the ashes,5,32,Ema,... Darke knocked down Mr. Marshall and raised his knife.
Rise from the ashes,5,33,Phoenix,(Neil Marshall was stabbed right in front of this poor girl!)
Rise from the ashes,5,34,Ema,"I don't remember what happened after that. Apparently I passed out. When I came to, Lana was cradling me in her arms."
Rise from the ashes,5,35,Phoenix,Poor Ema... You've been through so much.
Rise from the ashes,5,36,Ema,"I-I couldn't bring myself to testify about that instant. I tried, but the words just wouldn't come out. I drew a picture, but it wasn't any good."
Rise from the ashes,5,37,Phoenix,Two years ago... You must have been 14. That's understandable.
Rise from the ashes,5,38,Ema,"Once it was all over... I made up my mind. I decided that when I grew up, I'd become a scientific investigator. I want to be able to fight crime with my testimonies! And find the evidence to make an airtight case... That way, Lana would never have to forge any."
Rise from the ashes,5,39,Phoenix,I see... (I think I'm finally starting to understand what makes Ema tick. But there's still something that bothers me about that crime.)
Rise from the ashes,5,40,Phoenix,"There's something that's puzzling me, Ema."
Rise from the ashes,5,41,Ema,What is it?
Rise from the ashes,5,42,Phoenix,"You said you were in Lana's office at that time, right?"
Rise from the ashes,5,43,Ema,That's right.
Rise from the ashes,5,44,Phoenix,Why then would a serial killer come running in there?
Rise from the ashes,5,45,Phoenix,"Not only that, but he was being chased by a prosecutor?"
Rise from the ashes,5,46,Ema,"Oh, there's no mystery there. Joe Darke had been taken in for questioning that day."
Rise from the ashes,5,47,Phoenix,Taken in for questioning? You mean by the police?
Rise from the ashes,5,48,Ema,"Of course. This happened at the Police Department. He tried to run away halfway through the interview, and fled into my sister's office."
Rise from the ashes,5,49,Phoenix,But why did he run all the way over to your sister's office?
Rise from the ashes,5,50,Ema,Because the detective offices and the questioning room are right across from the elevator.
Rise from the ashes,5,51,Phoenix,"... Across from the elevator? But Lana was the Chief Prosecutor, wasn't she?"
Rise from the ashes,5,52,Ema,"No, silly! Didn't I tell you? Two years ago... Lana was a detective. She was the best in the entire force!"
Rise from the ashes,5,53,Phoenix,Whaaaaat!? (That's news to me!)
Rise from the ashes,5,54,Ema,"After the Joe Darke case, she was transferred to the Prosecutor's Office and made Chief Prosecutor."
Rise from the ashes,5,55,Phoenix,(Lana used to be... a detective? I'd better have another talk with her!)
Rise from the ashes,5,56,Marshall,"Howdy, Bambina."
Rise from the ashes,5,57,Ema,"Oh, Mr. Marshall!"
Rise from the ashes,5,58,Marshall,"I never thought things'd turn out this way when I woke up this morning. Que serÃ  serÃ . You never know where life'll lead you, eh Bambina? I should've known my luck had run out when ol' Billy dried up this morning."
Rise from the ashes,5,59,Ema,Billy...?
Rise from the ashes,5,60,Phoenix,"Must be his pet cactus. Say, where are you headed?"
Rise from the ashes,5,61,Marshall,"Just over to the Prosecutor's Office for a little interrogation. It's a ""voluntary"" appearance, but we all know I won't be coming back. Sorry, but you can't go in the evidence room today, pardner."
Rise from the ashes,5,62,Ema,But Mr. Marshall... Why did you do it?
Rise from the ashes,5,63,Marshall,"Why do prospectors head west? If ever there was a case I needed to know the truth about, it was that one."
Rise from the ashes,5,64,Phoenix,"Before you turn yourself in, Mr. Marshall... would you mind telling us exactly what happened?"
Rise from the ashes,5,65,Marshall,Hmph... Looks like I won't be getting a steak lunch today.
Rise from the ashes,5,66,Marshall,Something was fishy about that trial from the beginning. It wasn't just me either. All the detectives thought so.
Rise from the ashes,5,67,Phoenix,"What do you mean, ""fishy""?"
Rise from the ashes,5,68,Marshall,Some of the facts reported were inconsistent with the evidence we found. For example... the murder weapon.
Rise from the ashes,5,69,Phoenix,The murder weapon? You mean... that switchblade knife with the broken tip?
Rise from the ashes,5,70,Marshall,"That was Joe Darke's, all right. But... in the initial autopsy report, a question was raised."
Rise from the ashes,5,71,Ema,A question...?
Rise from the ashes,5,72,Marshall,The blade of the knife was not a perfect match with the wound the victim sustained.
Rise from the ashes,5,73,Phoenix,What does that mean?
Rise from the ashes,5,74,Marshall,It means there is a good chance that knife was not the murder weapon.
Rise from the ashes,5,75,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,5,76,Marshall,"However, in the report that was finally submitted, that possibility had been erased."
Rise from the ashes,5,77,Phoenix,(Could the facts have been concealed with forged evidence...?)
Rise from the ashes,5,78,Marshall,That case left behind scars on all of us.
Rise from the ashes,5,79,Ema,"The ""scars"" that the SL-9 Incident left behind..."
Rise from the ashes,5,80,Marshall,"I got the looks, but he got the brains. He was one of the best prosecutors around. I had just made detective when it went down. It was our first case together..."
Rise from the ashes,5,81,Ema,How old was he... your brother?
Rise from the ashes,5,82,Marshall,He was 27 at the time. He was awarded the highest honor that very day.
Rise from the ashes,5,83,Phoenix,"The... ""highest honor""? You don't mean..."
Rise from the ashes,5,84,Marshall,King of Prosecutors.
Rise from the ashes,5,85,Phoenix,(Not that again...)
Rise from the ashes,5,86,Marshall,What are you looking at me like that for? That's an honor for a prosecutor!
Rise from the ashes,5,87,Phoenix,(Mr. Marshall must have really been close with his brother.)
Rise from the ashes,5,88,Ema,"The day the SL-9 Incident took place, that wasn't the same day as..."
Rise from the ashes,5,89,Marshall,That's right. It was the day of the evidence transferal.
Rise from the ashes,5,90,Phoenix,...! Interesting...
Rise from the ashes,5,91,Marshall,"It was drizzling that morning, and by nightfall there was thunder. I can't believe two years have gone by already. I tried to steal the evidence so the case wouldn't die."
Rise from the ashes,5,92,Phoenix,(Apparently someone tried to stop you. Detective Goodman was murdered... and the evidence locker was empty.)
Rise from the ashes,5,93,Marshall,"There was something going on behind the scenes in that case. We all knew that later. Every detective involved in that investigation, save one, was... taken care of. Ms. Starr was fired and I was demoted and boxed away in a tiny room."
Rise from the ashes,5,94,Phoenix,What about Detective Goodman?
Rise from the ashes,5,95,Marshall,"If they did something to him too, the commissioners would get suspicious. No, they were careful enough not to be too obvious."
Rise from the ashes,5,96,Phoenix,"""They""...?"
Rise from the ashes,5,97,Ema,Who are you talking about!?
Rise from the ashes,5,98,Marshall,"Don't get upset, Bambina. I mean Damon Gant... and Lana Skye."
Rise from the ashes,5,99,Marshall,"Chief Detective Damon Gant and his second-in-command, Lana Skye... There wasn't a person on the force who hadn't heard of that duo. That case was the biggest step in both of their careers."
Rise from the ashes,5,100,Phoenix,"After the case ended, Lana transferred to the Prosecutor's Office, right?"
Rise from the ashes,5,101,Marshall,"Yeah. Damon Gant, the new Chief of Police, arranged for that to happen. She's never been the same since she left."
Rise from the ashes,5,102,Ema,?
Rise from the ashes,5,103,Marshall,"Everyone who knew her said so. ""Chief Prosecutor Skye was totally different when she was a detective."""
Rise from the ashes,5,104,Phoenix,"(Now that he mentions it, Ema said something like that too...)"
Rise from the ashes,5,105,Ema,Tell me... what happened to my sister!
Rise from the ashes,5,106,Marshall,"Sorry, Bambina, but her secret is too well guarded. I never found out."
Rise from the ashes,5,107,Phoenix,"(Lana's ""secret""... It all started two years ago.)"
Rise from the ashes,5,108,Marshall,"So there you have it. That's my story. Did you enjoy it, pardner?"
Rise from the ashes,5,109,Phoenix,It was certainly... enlightening.
Rise from the ashes,5,110,Marshall,"There's one thing for sure I found out in court today. That boy Edgeworth isn't my enemy. He was the one who used falsified evidence to get a guilty verdict, but someone else was the one who gave him that evidence and planned everything. That someone is Damon Gant. Don't believe me? Well I don't blame you. I won't even be a patrolman after today. Too bad I won't be around to work with you... when you become a real scientific investigator. Adios Bambina!"
Rise from the ashes,5,111,Ema,L-Lana...
Rise from the ashes,5,112,Lana,Mr. Wright. It seems I keep causing you trouble.
Rise from the ashes,5,113,Phoenix,Falsifying evidence... I didn't think you were the type.
Rise from the ashes,5,114,Lana,"Criminals don't mind playing foul, why should we?"
Rise from the ashes,5,115,Ema,But Lana! If you're wrong... an innocent person might be found guilty!
Rise from the ashes,5,116,Lana,Believe me... I understand the risks.
Rise from the ashes,5,117,Phoenix,Lana. Ema told me about you.
Rise from the ashes,5,118,Lana,Oh?
Rise from the ashes,5,119,Phoenix,"About how you were a detective two years ago, and how the SL-9 Incident was the reason for your transfer to the Prosecutor's Office."
Rise from the ashes,5,120,Lana,That's right.
Rise from the ashes,5,121,Phoenix,Could you fill me in on the details? Especially about that unusual change of jobs.
Rise from the ashes,5,122,Lana,"... I suppose you have a right to know, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,5,123,Phoenix,"A lot of revelations were uncovered at the trial today, not the least of which was the fact that this case is largely connected to another one, two years ago."
Rise from the ashes,5,124,Lana,Evidence from that case was stolen... I expected as much. I know how obsessive Officer Marshall can be.
Rise from the ashes,5,125,Ema,"That trial... it really wasn't ""fair,"" was it?"
Rise from the ashes,5,126,Lana,...
Rise from the ashes,5,127,Ema,"I believed in you, Lana! I believed that no matter what happened, you'd always stick to the truth!"
Rise from the ashes,5,128,Lana,"It couldn't be helped, Ema. At that trial two years ago... I sold my soul."
Rise from the ashes,5,129,Phoenix,"Well, all drama aside, the fact of the matter is at 5:15, there was no murder at the Police Department."
Rise from the ashes,5,130,Ema,"Tell me it's not true, Lana! What the witness... Ms. Starr said! About you stabbing Mr. Goodman with a knife!"
Rise from the ashes,5,131,Lana,...
Rise from the ashes,5,132,Ema,Lana! I don't understand! Why won't you tell us?
Rise from the ashes,5,133,Lana,Ema... This doesn't involve just me.
Rise from the ashes,5,134,Phoenix,(I don't think I've ever seen Lana look so fazed before...)
Rise from the ashes,5,135,Lana,It's true. I was a member of the police force two years ago.
Rise from the ashes,5,136,Ema,She was amazing! They still talk about all the cases she and Chief Gant cracked together!
Rise from the ashes,5,137,Phoenix,Chief Gant?
Rise from the ashes,5,138,Lana,"Then he was the Vice-Head of Criminal Affairs, but he still worked the crime scenes. Damon Gant... he was everything I aspired to be."
Rise from the ashes,5,139,Ema,They were the best team ever! They solved crimes before the reports could even be filed!
Rise from the ashes,5,140,Phoenix,(Ema really idolizes her big sister.) But now you're Chief Prosecutor... What happened?
Rise from the ashes,5,141,Lana,I always planned on becoming a prosecutor. The reason I became a detective was...
Rise from the ashes,5,142,Ema,"to gain experience investigating crime scenes, so you could later use that experience in court."
Rise from the ashes,5,143,Lana,"Gant's help in the SL-9 case was critical in its resolution. After that, he became Chief of Police, and arranged my transfer to the Prosecutor's Office."
Rise from the ashes,5,144,Phoenix,"(Maybe I should ask more about this ""investigation"" of theirs two years ago.)"
Rise from the ashes,5,145,Lana,Two years ago I was second-in- command of the detectives investigating Darke.
Rise from the ashes,5,146,Phoenix,"""Second-in-command""? That means the Chief Detective was, no doubt, Damon Gant?"
Rise from the ashes,5,147,Lana,"Yes. Detective Gant and I shared the same office, and the same investigations."
Rise from the ashes,5,148,Phoenix,(They even had the same office...!)
Rise from the ashes,5,149,Lana,"We led a team of the best detectives on the force: Detective Goodman, whose case it was, Jake Marshall and Angel Starr. It was the first time Marshall worked with his brother. He was quite... ""gung ho."" Without a doubt, Joe Darke was the serial killer. We asked him to come in for questioning. We were desperate for evidence. That was when the last murder took place."
Rise from the ashes,5,150,Phoenix,(When he tried to murder Ema...)
Rise from the ashes,5,151,Ema,Prosecutor Marshall was trying to save me from Darke...
Rise from the ashes,5,152,Lana,"You see, the first person who happened upon the scene of the crime... was me."
Rise from the ashes,5,153,Phoenix,...! (Now you tell us...)
Rise from the ashes,5,154,Lana,"Detective Gant and Prosecutor Marshall were the ones questioning Darke that day. The investigation was in its final stages, when Darke must have panicked. He waited until Gant and Marshall let their guards down, then fled the room. From there, he ran straight to... the office shared by Detective Gant and myself."
Rise from the ashes,5,155,Ema,That's where he found me.
Rise from the ashes,5,156,Phoenix,"So you were the first person to run to the scene, Lana?"
Rise from the ashes,5,157,Lana,"It appears so. I was filing some papers while Gant and Marshall were questioning Darke. When I returned to my office, I saw three bodies on the floor and smelled blood."
Rise from the ashes,5,158,Phoenix,"Three bodies? Prosecutor Marshall, the victim, Ema, who had passed out,"
Rise from the ashes,5,159,Lana,"and the suspect, Joe Darke. During the struggle, it seems Mr. Marshall stuck a final blow before he died. Joe Darke had incurred a minor concussion, and lay unconscious."
Rise from the ashes,5,160,Phoenix,What did you do?
Rise from the ashes,5,161,Lana,"To be honest, I panicked. I picked up Ema, carried her out of the room and just held her."
Rise from the ashes,5,162,Phoenix,"(Can't blame her, after all her sister must have gone through.)"
Rise from the ashes,5,163,Lana,"After that, I placed Darke under immediate arrest."
Rise from the ashes,5,164,Phoenix,Let me get this straight. You were all involved in the SL-9 Incident?
Rise from the ashes,5,165,Lana,"That's right. Quite a coincidence, hmm?"
Rise from the ashes,5,166,Phoenix,I don't buy it.
Rise from the ashes,5,167,Ema,W-what are you saying?
Rise from the ashes,5,168,Phoenix,"There's no way everyone involved in this trial was also involved in that incident just by ""chance."""
Rise from the ashes,5,169,Ema,But that case was solved two years ago!
Rise from the ashes,5,170,Phoenix,At least one person went to extremes because they didn't believe it was truly solved.
Rise from the ashes,5,171,Lana,"Officer Marshall... Yes, his actions came as a surprise to me as well. Ever since his brother died, he's changed completely."
Rise from the ashes,5,172,Ema,I guess he wasn't convinced with the ruling against Joe Darke.
Rise from the ashes,5,173,Lana,... Life doesn't end with the closing of a case. Everyone has to live the rest of their lives with their memories.
Rise from the ashes,5,174,Phoenix,"That ""case"" just might not be over yet."
Rise from the ashes,5,175,Lana,!
Rise from the ashes,5,176,Phoenix,"Ema was assaulted by Darke at the Police Department, right?"
Rise from the ashes,5,177,Lana,"Yes, in the office that Damon Gant and I shared. The office that Mr. Gant now occupies by himself: the Chief's office."
Rise from the ashes,5,178,Phoenix,(Maybe we should have a look at the Chief's office - the site of the final SL-9 murder!)
Rise from the ashes,5,179,Phoenix,"This place is always pretty empty, but today it's deserted."
Rise from the ashes,5,180,Ema,That must mean everyone's busy solving crimes.
Rise from the ashes,5,181,Chief,"Oh, if you're looking for the others, they're all in the conference room."
Rise from the ashes,5,182,Phoenix,"Uh... thanks. (Wow, he actually talked to us!)"
Rise from the ashes,5,183,Chief,"With the Chief Prosecutor saying what she did and the decision about what to do about Mr. Edgeworth, not to mention our statement to the media and tomorrow's trial... there's more chaos going on than Thanksgiving and Christmas put together!"
Rise from the ashes,5,184,Phoenix,"(I think ""festive"" is the word usually used for those...)"
Rise from the ashes,5,185,Ema,"Um, sir? We'd like to have a look around for Chief Gant's office."
Rise from the ashes,5,186,Chief,Just head across the hall to the other building and take the elevator to the top floor.
Rise from the ashes,5,187,Ema,"Really? You mean, it's okay for us to go in there? I mean, we aren't police officers or anything."
Rise from the ashes,5,188,Chief,"Hey, you're right! You can't go in there! It's off limits!"
Rise from the ashes,5,189,Phoenix,(Now I see where Detective Gumshoe gets his unique charm...)
Rise from the ashes,5,190,Ema,"Well, what are wating for? Let's head to the Chief's office!"
Rise from the ashes,5,191,Phoenix,Whoa... Where am I?
Rise from the ashes,5,192,Ema,"In the Chief's office, silly! At least, that's what it said on the door."
Rise from the ashes,5,193,Phoenix,"Check out that pipe organ. That's real, isn't it?"
Rise from the ashes,5,194,Ema,"Hey, I used to take organ lessons in kindergarten! They used to call me ""Little Miss Bach."" I thought I was a genius until they tried teaching me notes. I never could remember where C was..."
Rise from the ashes,5,195,Gant,"Hm? Oh, it's you two."
Rise from the ashes,5,196,Phoenix,Chief Gant! (He put that paper he was reading in his desk.)
Rise from the ashes,5,197,Gant,"So, Mr. Wright. Have you been swimming lately?"
Rise from the ashes,5,198,Phoenix,"Uh... no, I haven't. I've been kind of busy lately."
Rise from the ashes,5,199,Gant,"I can appreciate that. I've had my hands full too, with Mr. Marshall's misconduct and Lana's provocative statement."
Rise from the ashes,5,200,Phoenix,"""Provocative statement""... oh, you mean about the forged evidence."
Rise from the ashes,5,201,Gant,"Two years have passed since that incident. My, how time flies! See that big picture on the wall over there? That's a picture of Lana, Neil and me."
Rise from the ashes,5,202,Phoenix,(So this is Mr. Marshall's brother... Prosecutor Neil Marshall...)
Rise from the ashes,5,203,Gant,We took it to commemorate our work together.
Rise from the ashes,5,204,Phoenix,... (Something's not right with this picture. I can't quite seem to put my finger on it though...)
Rise from the ashes,5,205,Gant,"Anyway, I'd like to reminisce all day, but there are matters that need my attention. I'm going to lock up here, so let's go out together."
Rise from the ashes,5,206,Ema,"Oh... But this office... it was a crime scene two years ago, wasn't it?"
Rise from the ashes,5,207,Gant,That case has long since been over. There's no need to investigate it any more.
Rise from the ashes,5,208,Phoenix,"All the same, we'd still like to have a look around."
Rise from the ashes,5,209,Gant,Perhaps you didn't hear me. I said there's no need to investigate it any more.
Rise from the ashes,5,210,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,5,211,Gant,Now hurry up and get out. I have a meeting to attend.
Rise from the ashes,5,212,Ema,Looks like we aren't welcome.
Rise from the ashes,5,213,Phoenix,"It seems that case isn't over with yet, after all."
Rise from the ashes,5,214,Ema,What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,5,215,Phoenix,"Chief Gant denied our request to search the ""crime scene."" That means there must be a reason he doesn't want us looking around in there."
Rise from the ashes,5,216,Ema,"You mean like, a clue!?"
Rise from the ashes,5,217,Phoenix,(There's got to be a way we can get inside the Chief's office...)
Rise from the ashes,5,218,Gumshoe,"Hey, pal!"
Rise from the ashes,5,219,Phoenix,Detective Gumshoe! Were you in a meeting?
Rise from the ashes,5,220,Gumshoe,I was uh... just taking a breather. My feet hurt.
Rise from the ashes,5,221,Ema,From sitting so long in the meeting?
Rise from the ashes,5,222,Gumshoe,Actually... I had to serve everyone coffee.
Rise from the ashes,5,223,Phoenix,(Sounds like Detective Gumshoe's still out of the loop...)
Rise from the ashes,5,224,Gumshoe,"Say, have either of you seen Mr. Edgeworth?"
Rise from the ashes,5,225,Phoenix,Edgeworth? No. Why do you ask?
Rise from the ashes,5,226,Gumshoe,He's under fire from both the Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office. It's almost like the battles between you two in court!
Rise from the ashes,5,227,Phoenix,That sounds serious...
Rise from the ashes,5,228,Ema,Is it because of what my sister said?
Rise from the ashes,5,229,Gumshoe,That's basically what it all boils down to. That falsified evidence two years ago. Now Mr. Edgeworth has the whole world after his blood!
Rise from the ashes,5,230,Ema,Yikes...
Rise from the ashes,5,231,Phoenix,"But why would Edgeworth be blamed? It's not like he knew the evidence was forged! Lana Skye is the guilty party here, isn't she?"
Rise from the ashes,5,232,Ema,...
Rise from the ashes,5,233,Gumshoe,"Regardless, the prosecutor is responsible for the evidence he presents in court. Not only that, but as you know there've been a lot of rumors going around about Mr. Edgeworth. Those who don't like him haven't been able to do anything because of his amazing talent as a prosecutor. But now with this..."
Rise from the ashes,5,234,Ema,Are there really so many people who hate him?
Rise from the ashes,5,235,Gumshoe,"In our world, only those with talent rise to the top. Mr. Edgeworth not only had that, but he's young. There's no better recipe I know of for making enemies."
Rise from the ashes,5,236,Police,"Hey, Dick! Keep up the good work!"
Rise from the ashes,5,237,Gumshoe,Yes sir!
Rise from the ashes,5,238,Police,"Let's go out for lunch again sometime, my treat!"
Rise from the ashes,5,239,Gumshoe,Yes sir!
Rise from the ashes,5,240,Police,"You gotta take me back to that joint sometime, okay Dick?"
Rise from the ashes,5,241,Gumshoe,Yes sir!
Rise from the ashes,5,242,Phoenix,It seems you don't have any problem with enemies.
Rise from the ashes,5,243,Gumshoe,"Yeah, well... I'm careful not to stick out. Anyway, I'm a bit worried about him. Under all this pressure, I'm afraid Mr. Edgeworth just might crack."
Rise from the ashes,5,244,Gumshoe,"Actually, I took a look at the file earlier, while the coffee was brewing."
Rise from the ashes,5,245,Phoenix,(He seems geniunely concerned for Edgeworth...) Well? Did you find out anything?
Rise from the ashes,5,246,Gumshoe,The only evidence Darke left behind was during his final attack.
Rise from the ashes,5,247,Phoenix,His final attack? You mean...
Rise from the ashes,5,248,Gumshoe,"When he killed Prosecutor Marshall, who was trying to protect some girl."
Rise from the ashes,5,249,Ema,Me...
Rise from the ashes,5,250,Phoenix,(It seems Detective Gumshoe never realized Ema was the girl...)
Rise from the ashes,5,251,Gumshoe,That's when he left the most incriminating evidence of all.
Rise from the ashes,5,252,Ema,Well? What was it?
Rise from the ashes,5,253,Gumshoe,"Oh, um, let's see... I think it had something to do with the murder weapon... ... Oh, I forget. Look, it's all written somewhere in here, okay?"
Rise from the ashes,5,254,Phoenix,(His powers of recollection never fail to impress.)
Rise from the ashes,5,255,Ema,Maybe we should show him the murder weapon. It might jog his memory!
Rise from the ashes,5,256,Gumshoe,Joe Darke was 42 at the time of the crime. He was just your run-of-the-mill businessman.
Rise from the ashes,5,257,Phoenix,A businessman? What made him take to serial killing?
Rise from the ashes,5,258,Gumshoe,"One day on his way home from work, he hit someone with his car."
Rise from the ashes,5,259,Ema,With his car? So... it was an accident?
Rise from the ashes,5,260,Gumshoe,"An accident, yes. But it transformed him into an animal!"
Rise from the ashes,5,261,Ema,An animal...
Rise from the ashes,5,262,Gumshoe,"He killed a man that witnessed the accident. Then he killed a lady who saw the second crime. A kid walked by just then, so he killed him too. Then, when he was burying the bodies, a jogger came upon the scene and was killed as well! Finally he turned himself in."
Rise from the ashes,5,263,Phoenix,Seems he was a pretty careless animal.
Rise from the ashes,5,264,Gumshoe,"Of course, this is all conjecture. There wasn't a single shred of evidence."
Rise from the ashes,5,265,Phoenix,"So, he turned himself in..."
Rise from the ashes,5,266,Gumshoe,"Yes, but in the middle of his questioning, he fled and murdered his final victim... Prosecutor Marshall. That crime was witnessed by someone too, but fortunately he was arrested on the spot. It's a good thing that last witness wasn't killed."
Rise from the ashes,5,267,Phoenix,"(That last ""witness""... He must mean Ema...)"
Rise from the ashes,5,268,Phoenix,"Um, about this..."
Rise from the ashes,5,269,Gumshoe,Hey! Don't tell me that's...
Rise from the ashes,5,270,Phoenix,"It has a tag attached to it, with the label ""SL-9 Incident"" on it. I believe this would be the broken ""murder weapon"" you were speaking of?"
Rise from the ashes,5,271,Gumshoe,"What are you doing with that!? Ever since that case was closed, that knife's been locked away in a locker."
Rise from the ashes,5,272,Ema,"On the day Detective Goodman was murdered, this suddenly disappeared from the locker, and was found in Mr. Edgeworth's car muffler."
Rise from the ashes,5,273,Gumshoe,"... That's it! Now I remember what that incriminating piece of evidence was! When you showed me that knife, it all came back to me!"
Rise from the ashes,5,274,Ema,"Well, what is it, Detective? Quick! Before you forget again!"
Rise from the ashes,5,275,Phoenix,"This knife... it was Joe Darke's, wasn't it?"
Rise from the ashes,5,276,Gumshoe,"That's right. We traced it back to the store he bought it at, and it had his fingerprints on it too."
Rise from the ashes,5,277,Ema,"But no one actually witnessed him using it to murder anyone, right?"
Rise from the ashes,5,278,Gumshoe,That's where his luck ran out. When you take a good look at the knife... you'll see it's broken!
Rise from the ashes,5,279,Ema,You don't have to take a good look to notice that.
Rise from the ashes,5,280,Gumshoe,"... Yeah, well anyway! Take a guess where the broken- off tip of the knife was found. That's what did him in!"
Rise from the ashes,5,281,Ema,Where was it?
Rise from the ashes,5,282,Gumshoe,"The victim, Neil Marshall was carrying it... inside his own body!"
Rise from the ashes,5,283,Phoenix,!
Rise from the ashes,5,284,Gumshoe,It was found deep inside the stab wound.
Rise from the ashes,5,285,Phoenix,Did it match Darke's knife?
Rise from the ashes,5,286,Gumshoe,You bet. Down to the last fiber.
Rise from the ashes,5,287,Ema,That's pretty... conclusive.
Rise from the ashes,5,288,Gumshoe,"Well, there you have it in a nutshell. That's all I know."
Rise from the ashes,5,289,Phoenix,Can I ask you one more thing?
Rise from the ashes,5,290,Gumshoe,"What is it? If it's money you need, you should ask Chief Gant."
Rise from the ashes,5,291,Phoenix,"It's not money, but it does concern the Chief. His office is a ""crime scene,"" right? It's where Prosecutor Neil Marshall was murdered..."
Rise from the ashes,5,292,Ema,"The Chief's out now, and his office is locked, but we'd like to have a look around if that's okay."
Rise from the ashes,5,293,Gumshoe,"... Well, any Detective's ID card can unlock the door."
Rise from the ashes,5,294,Ema,What? Really!?
Rise from the ashes,5,295,Gumshoe,"But if I let a civilian in there, I'd be charged with breach of trust."
Rise from the ashes,5,296,Ema,Breach of trust...?
Rise from the ashes,5,297,Gumshoe,"Simply put, I'd be canned."
Rise from the ashes,5,298,Phoenix,Oh...
Rise from the ashes,5,299,Gumshoe,"Sorry, pal. I don't plan on getting fired because of you."
Rise from the ashes,5,300,Ema,How about this ID card? It was Detective Goodman's...
Rise from the ashes,5,301,Gumshoe,That won't work either. The data was deleted the day he died.
Rise from the ashes,5,302,Ema,Oh.
Rise from the ashes,5,303,Phoenix,"(So in other words, Gumshoe is our only chance of getting into that office.)"
Rise from the ashes,5,304,Ema,I wonder if there's something we could show him that would make him change his mind...
Rise from the ashes,5,305,Phoenix,(I wonder if Edgeworth is back yet.)
Rise from the ashes,5,306,Ema,There he is! It looks like he's writing something.
Rise from the ashes,5,307,Edgeworth,Huh? What are you doing here?
Rise from the ashes,5,308,Phoenix,"(He sure was quick to throw that paper on the floor...) Tough day in court, huh?"
Rise from the ashes,5,309,Edgeworth,Hmph. I've had to live the past two years with rumors flying around. What's another allegation to me?
Rise from the ashes,5,310,Ema,"Cheer up, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm rooting for you!"
Rise from the ashes,5,311,Phoenix,(That's Edgeworth for you... Always trying to hide his real feelings.)
Rise from the ashes,5,312,Edgeworth,"So, what do you want? Unlike some people, I don't have all day."
Rise from the ashes,5,313,Edgeworth,"There's no excuse for what I've done. Two years ago, I used false evidence to obtain a guilty verdict. That's what it all breaks down to, and nothing I do can erase that fact."
Rise from the ashes,5,314,Phoenix,"But you didn't know, did you? I mean, that the evidence was falsified."
Rise from the ashes,5,315,Edgeworth,"The Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office share a bond of trust. If that bond is broken, we stand to lose everything. The Police Department's error is my error, my responsibility as the prosecutor in charge. That fact remains the same no matter what excuses I might have."
Rise from the ashes,5,316,Ema,Mr. Edgeworth...
Rise from the ashes,5,317,Edgeworth,I take pride in my work. So tell me why! Why has it all come to this...
Rise from the ashes,5,318,Phoenix,(Even Edgeworth can't keep this kind of emotion bottled up...)
Rise from the ashes,5,319,Phoenix,Are you up for the trial tomorrow?
Rise from the ashes,5,320,Edgeworth,"Hmph. First last year's trial, and now this one. It seems all you do is worry about me. To be honest, you're getting on my nerves."
Rise from the ashes,5,321,Ema,But Mr. Edgeworth! You can't just walk out on the trial...
Rise from the ashes,5,322,Edgeworth,Tomorrow is the last day. It's too late to change prosecutors. I'll bet that's what my superiors are banking on. I never thought that case would come back to haunt me like this.
Rise from the ashes,5,323,Phoenix,What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,5,324,Edgeworth,That list of evidence. It seems too short. Most lists... run twice as long.
Rise from the ashes,5,325,Phoenix,It's only half as long as most lists? (That is odd...)
Rise from the ashes,5,326,Edgeworth,"After Neil Marshall was murdered, I became prosecutor for that case. I may not have been part of the investigation, but at the time there was only one thing on my mind: I'd use the evidence I was given to prove the suspect guilty!"
Rise from the ashes,5,327,Ema,"Say, we just saw a picture taken around that time."
Rise from the ashes,5,328,Phoenix,(That picture... Something seemed strange about it...)
Rise from the ashes,5,329,Phoenix,"Could you tell us again about what happened that day? The day Detective Goodman was murdered? You were participating in a ceremony over at the station, right?"
Rise from the ashes,5,330,Edgeworth,"I've never cared for ceremonies, but I had to attend that one."
Rise from the ashes,5,331,Ema,Because you were awarded this?
Rise from the ashes,5,332,Edgeworth,"Those receiving awards can't exactly skip out on the ceremony. I finished up at the office in the morning, then drove over to the Police Department."
Rise from the ashes,5,333,Phoenix,"You, ""finished up"" at the office?"
Rise from the ashes,5,334,Edgeworth,"Yes. Just odds and ends- clerical stuff. I didn't plan on returning to the office that day. That is, until I was asked to take something back."
Rise from the ashes,5,335,Ema,Take something back?
Rise from the ashes,5,336,Edgeworth,This.
Rise from the ashes,5,337,Ema,"Oh yeah. Chief Gant asked you to hold onto that, didn't he?"
Rise from the ashes,5,338,Edgeworth,Yes. It was a piece of evidence in a case that was closed half a year ago. He asked me to bring it back to the Prosecutor's Office.
Rise from the ashes,5,339,Phoenix,(That's the story we heard yesterday...) So you came back here to the Prosecutor's Office because the Chief asked you to?
Rise from the ashes,5,340,Edgeworth,That's right.
Rise from the ashes,5,341,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,5,342,Phoenix,This picture was hanging on the wall in Chief Gant's office.
Rise from the ashes,5,343,Edgeworth,Prosecutor Neil Marshall... He had just started making a name for himself. Looks like this was taken when he received the King of Prosecutors trophy.
Rise from the ashes,5,344,Ema,"Speaking of that, there's something that bothers me."
Rise from the ashes,5,345,Edgeworth,Yes?
Rise from the ashes,5,346,Ema,The trophy Mr. Marshall is holding... it's a little different than yours.
Rise from the ashes,5,347,Edgeworth,"Yes, you're right. ... I remember now."
Rise from the ashes,5,348,Phoenix,Remember what?
Rise from the ashes,5,349,Edgeworth,That was the official prosecutor trophy used until that time. There's a story behind it.
Rise from the ashes,5,350,Ema,A story?
Rise from the ashes,5,351,Phoenix,(Sounds interesting.) Would you mind telling it to us?
Rise from the ashes,5,352,Edgeworth,"It's simple, really. ""Contradiction."" That's what the award's based on."
Rise from the ashes,5,353,Edgeworth,"This award originates from an ancient Chinese tale. In Chinese, the word ""contradiction"" is written with two characters: the first means ""halberd,"" and the second means ""shield."" Have you heard this story?"
Rise from the ashes,5,354,Phoenix,"Me? Oh, uh... sure. Everyone knows that! Why don't you tell it though... for Ema's sake."
Rise from the ashes,5,355,Edgeworth,"Very well. Long ago in the kingdom of Chu, there was an arms merchant. One day, he presented the king with two items. The first was a halberd he claimed could slice through any shield or armor. The second was a shield he claimed could withstand any weapon."
Rise from the ashes,5,356,Phoenix,Hmm... Wait a minute.
Rise from the ashes,5,357,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,5,358,Phoenix,Those claims contradict each other!
Rise from the ashes,5,359,Edgeworth,"Very perceptive. But then again, you've heard this story before, right? Anyway, as you mentioned, the very descriptions of these items discredit them both. When the king pointed this out, the merchant was left speechless. And thus, the Chinese word for ""contradiction"" was born."
Rise from the ashes,5,360,Ema,"Oh, I see! So the ""chipped shield"" and the ""broken knife"" symbolize..."
Rise from the ashes,5,361,Edgeworth,"Precisely so. They symbolize the merchant's items. The ancient tale ends with the merchant at a loss for words, but it's in our nature to pursue matters to their conclusion... even if it results in something as ugly as this."
Rise from the ashes,5,362,Ema,"Wow. Thanks, Mr. Edgeworth! I learned something new today!"
Rise from the ashes,5,363,Phoenix,"That's funny... If that's so, then why were you only given a shield?"
Rise from the ashes,5,364,Edgeworth,"... You'll have to ask Chief Gant. Two years ago, he had the ""halberd"" part of the award abolished."
Rise from the ashes,5,365,Phoenix,(Chief Gant...)
Rise from the ashes,5,366,Angel,Excuse me...
Rise from the ashes,5,367,Angel,Would either of you care for a quarter pound of roast beef?
Rise from the ashes,5,368,Phoenix,Ms. Starr! (I guess she's out of lunches.)
Rise from the ashes,5,369,Angel,"You certainly are the curious sort, aren't you? Kind of like the first person who sucked a cow's nipple to discover milk. Still, I never thought you'd go digging up that case from two years ago."
Rise from the ashes,5,370,Phoenix,"Everyone in this trial was involved in the SL-9 Incident. Not only that, but the murder occurred on the very day the evidence from that case was due for transferal. This can't all be attributed to mere ""coincidence."""
Rise from the ashes,5,371,Angel,"... Aren't you forgetting something? You know, that little scene I happened to witness?"
Rise from the ashes,5,372,Phoenix,(The instant Lana stabbed Detective Goodman with a knife.)
Rise from the ashes,5,373,Angel,"No matter how much of the past you dig up, it won't change what I saw. Roast beef is meant to be savored when eaten."
Rise from the ashes,5,374,Phoenix,(Ms. Starr's hatred toward Lana... It all dates back to two years ago!)
Rise from the ashes,5,375,Angel,"Joe Darke... That's a name I'll not soon forget! We trailed him for half a year. Oh, the pressure! Still, I don't think I was ever more alive than I was then. Those days were steamier than a bowl of hot gravy! Poor old Jake Marshall, though, must have been going through hell."
Rise from the ashes,5,376,Phoenix,"You mean, because of his brother's death?"
Rise from the ashes,5,377,Angel,"They were close, those two. After Neil died, something took over Jake. He became obsessed. Seeing Jake like that made her all the more desperate."
Rise from the ashes,5,378,Phoenix,"""Her""...?"
Rise from the ashes,5,379,Angel,Lana Skye.
Rise from the ashes,5,380,Ema,My sister...?
Rise from the ashes,5,381,Angel,The best of the best were put on that SL-9 case. Of course they were lead by that legendary duo.
Rise from the ashes,5,382,Ema,Lana... and Chief Gant!
Rise from the ashes,5,383,Angel,That legendary pair was the reason we were able to keep up our investigation. That's why we're so shocked over how it turned out...
Rise from the ashes,5,384,Phoenix,"You mean, with the forging of the evidence?"
Rise from the ashes,5,385,Angel,"Don't get me wrong. Joe Darke got what he deserved. Still, it was obvious the evidence produced in court was being manipulated. Items our team never found would suddenly appear, while other items were kept secret."
Rise from the ashes,5,386,Ema,But you didn't have proof anything illegal was done...
Rise from the ashes,5,387,Angel,I'm proof enough of what happened.
Rise from the ashes,5,388,Ema,!
Rise from the ashes,5,389,Angel,"After that case, all of us save Goodman were relieved of our duties... most without even so much as an explanation. Then Lana Skye transferred to the Prosecutor's Office and became Chief Prosecutor."
Rise from the ashes,5,390,Ema,Lana always wanted to be a prosecutor.
Rise from the ashes,5,391,Angel,Nothing's quite as simple as it appears.
Rise from the ashes,5,392,Ema,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,5,393,Angel,Lana Skye was merely being used as a pawn. That's my take on the matter.
Rise from the ashes,5,394,Phoenix,She was being used?
Rise from the ashes,5,395,Angel,"Damon Gant and Lana Skye... Two years ago Gant was Chief Detective, and Lana second in command. They were the best."
Rise from the ashes,5,396,Ema,"They solved all kinds of cases together, didn't they?"
Rise from the ashes,5,397,Angel,Damon Gant's magnetism in particular was almost unreal.
Rise from the ashes,5,398,Phoenix,"His ""magnetism""?"
Rise from the ashes,5,399,Angel,By that I mean his ability to attract evidence. He'd produce the most incredible evidence in the cases he handled.
Rise from the ashes,5,400,Phoenix,"(""Incredible evidence""? You mean...)"
Rise from the ashes,5,401,Angel,"Oh, yes. There were rumors about him even back then. No one dared confront him, though."
Rise from the ashes,5,402,Phoenix,(I take it she's talking about forged evidence.)
Rise from the ashes,5,403,Angel,"Back then, everyone looked up to Lana. All the detectives wanted to be like her."
Rise from the ashes,5,404,Ema,! Really?
Rise from the ashes,5,405,Angel,"Oh yes... myself included. I was a fool, really. She hated anything crooked, and always watched out for the other detectives. That's why she was so concerned for Jake."
Rise from the ashes,5,406,Ema,Mr. Marshall...
Rise from the ashes,5,407,Angel,"When Jake's brother was murdered, she felt as if she had lost her own brother. If it wasn't for her, I don't think Jake would ever have recovered from his shock. That's what makes it all the more infuriating."
Rise from the ashes,5,408,Ema,Ms. Starr...
Rise from the ashes,5,409,Angel,That's why... I'll never be able to forgive her. Why did she have to turn so cold after that...?
Rise from the ashes,5,410,Ema,...
Rise from the ashes,5,411,Phoenix,"Lana transferred to the Prosecutor's Office two years ago, didn't she?"
Rise from the ashes,5,412,Angel,"Yes, thanks to ""Chief"" Gant's powerful influence."
Rise from the ashes,5,413,Ema,Chief...
Rise from the ashes,5,414,Angel,"That's right. Having solved the SL-9 case, his position as chief was secured. There was only one thing left for him to control, and then no one could stand in his way: the Prosecutor's Office."
Rise from the ashes,5,415,Phoenix,What? You mean... That's why Lana was transferred!?
Rise from the ashes,5,416,Angel,"If he could control the Chief Prosecutor, he could control the Prosecutor's Office. That must have been his goal all along."
Rise from the ashes,5,417,Ema,B-but how could he control Lana?
Rise from the ashes,5,418,Angel,"I don't know, but one thing's for sure. Ever since that case ended, she's never been the same. It's only logical to conclude... there must have been a reason for her change."
Rise from the ashes,5,419,Phoenix,"(At last... I'm finally getting close to the bottom of this ugly mess.) Thank you, Ms. Starr."
Rise from the ashes,5,420,Angel,"You listen to me, Rookie. It takes more than just ingredients to create fine cuisine. I hope you turn out to be a better chef than I've been..."
Rise from the ashes,5,421,Gumshoe,"Oh, you're back."
Rise from the ashes,5,422,Phoenix,You're still here?
Rise from the ashes,5,423,Gumshoe,"I gotta make 150 copies of these files. Brewing coffee, copying files... I'm turning into a regular DJ!"
Rise from the ashes,5,424,Ema,"You're a ""DJ"" as well?"
Rise from the ashes,5,425,Phoenix,"If I'm not mistaken, I think he means ""Desk Jockey."""
Rise from the ashes,5,426,Ema,"... Oh, that DJ..."
Rise from the ashes,5,427,Gumshoe,"I gotta admire your persistency, but my answer's still no."
Rise from the ashes,5,428,Ema,?
Rise from the ashes,5,429,Gumshoe,"I'm not letting you in the Chief's office, period. It'd be my neck on the line."
Rise from the ashes,5,430,Phoenix,(That office is the last crime scene in the SL-9 Incident. I have to take a look in there!)
Rise from the ashes,5,431,Ema,There's got to be something we can do to make the Detective change his mind.
Rise from the ashes,5,432,Gumshoe,What's this crumpled up piece of paper? ...... N--no way! Mr. Edgeworth can't be serious!
Rise from the ashes,5,433,Phoenix,Is he ever not serious?
Rise from the ashes,5,434,Gumshoe,I can't believe they've pushed him this far...
Rise from the ashes,5,435,Ema,Mr. Edgeworth really feels responsible.
Rise from the ashes,5,436,Gumshoe,"At first I thought he was as cold as ice, but now I know different! He trusted us detectives to provide him with sound evidence, but we just... we betrayed him!"
Rise from the ashes,5,437,Ema,Detective...
Rise from the ashes,5,438,Gumshoe,......... That's it. I've made up my mind!
Rise from the ashes,5,439,Ema,But...
Rise from the ashes,5,440,Gumshoe,"Here, take my ID card."
Rise from the ashes,5,441,Phoenix,We can't do that. If someone found out...
Rise from the ashes,5,442,Ema,they wouldn't let you off the hook with another lost item report!
Rise from the ashes,5,443,Gumshoe,"Look at me. It's no secret I'm already out of the loop. After all, I'm friends with Mr. Edgeworth. Depending on how this case turns out, I may already be as good as terminated..."
Rise from the ashes,5,444,Phoenix,(What...?)
Rise from the ashes,5,445,Gumshoe,So at least let me do this... for Mr. Edgeworth's sake!
Rise from the ashes,5,446,Phoenix,"All right, Detective. Thank you."
Rise from the ashes,5,447,Ema,"Here goes, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,5,448,_,*click* *beep*
Rise from the ashes,5,449,Ema,"Open sesame. If anyone finds us now,"
Rise from the ashes,5,450,Phoenix,Detective Gumshoe's a goner.
Rise from the ashes,5,451,Gumshoe,"If that happens, I'm counting on you to bail me out!"
Rise from the ashes,5,452,Ema,EEEEEEEEK!
Rise from the ashes,5,453,Gumshoe,GAAAAAAAAH!
Rise from the ashes,5,454,Ema,"Sorry, I thought you were a ghost."
Rise from the ashes,5,455,Gumshoe,I didn't even know you could slap a ghost.
Rise from the ashes,5,456,Phoenix,AAAAH! Detective Gumshoe! What are you doing sneaking up on us like that!?
Rise from the ashes,5,457,Gumshoe,"I-I-I wasn't ""sneaking."" I was just worried something might go wrong... so I came too."
Rise from the ashes,5,458,Phoenix,"If you're here, then what's the point in giving us your ID card!?"
Rise from the ashes,5,459,Gumshoe,"Hey, don't do that to my card!"
Rise from the ashes,5,460,Gumshoe,"I hardly ever get a chance to come in here, so I figured I'd have a look around myself! Besides, we're all in this together now."
Rise from the ashes,5,461,Ema,"You really do want to get fired, don't you?"
Rise from the ashes,5,462,Gumshoe,"Not if we're lucky. Now come on, let's see what we can find out!"
Rise from the ashes,5,463,Phoenix,(I've got a bad feeling about this...)
Rise from the ashes,5,464,Phoenix,That desk on the other side of the room... Was that your sister's?
Rise from the ashes,5,465,Ema,Yes. That's where I was waiting for Lana... on that day two years ago.
Rise from the ashes,5,466,Phoenix,Is anyone using it now?
Rise from the ashes,5,467,Gumshoe,No sir. This is entirely Chief Gant's office now.
Rise from the ashes,5,468,Gumshoe,"He practices a strict policy of ""preserving the crime scene."""
Rise from the ashes,5,469,Phoenix,(That's a strange reason to leave it there...)
Rise from the ashes,5,470,Gumshoe,"He leaves it as a warning to everyone else. He wants us to always be alert. He told us so himself at our New Year's party. Of course, he was pretty intoxicated at the time."
Rise from the ashes,5,471,Phoenix,I see.
Rise from the ashes,5,472,Ema,"So ever since Lana left, no one ever touches that desk?"
Rise from the ashes,5,473,Gumshoe,No one except Chief Gant... and the cleaning lady who's in here each morning.
Rise from the ashes,5,474,Phoenix,"(Still, two years have passed since that incident. There can't possibly be any clues remaining.)"
Rise from the ashes,5,475,Gumshoe,Can I ask you something?
Rise from the ashes,5,476,Phoenix,Sure.
Rise from the ashes,5,477,Gumshoe,"You only came here to look around, right? Because it's one of the SL-9 crime scenes. I mean, that's your only reason for coming here, isn't it?"
Rise from the ashes,5,478,Phoenix,... Why do you ask?
Rise from the ashes,5,479,Gumshoe,"You don't think... Nah! You wouldn't be... No. ... No, there's no way. Never mind. Don't worry about it."
Rise from the ashes,5,480,Phoenix,"Okay. Now then, let's look around a bit more."
Rise from the ashes,5,481,Gumshoe,"Hey, hold on! Not so fast, buddy!"
Rise from the ashes,5,482,Phoenix,Huh? What is it?
Rise from the ashes,5,483,Gumshoe,"When someone tells you ""don't worry about it,"" it's supposed to start bothering you, pal! You don't just let it go at that!"
Rise from the ashes,5,484,Phoenix,"S-sorry. (This guy's starting to get on my nerves.) Okay, so what's bothering you?"
Rise from the ashes,5,485,Gumshoe,"You two don't think... Chief Gant... might be a suspect, do you?"
Rise from the ashes,5,486,Ema,"What!? Yeah, Mr. Wright! What do we think of him?"
Rise from the ashes,5,487,Phoenix,(Chief Gant... So it's finally come to this. What do I think of him? Perhaps it's best I don't divulge my feelings... yet.)
Rise from the ashes,5,488,Gumshoe,"There he goes, ignoring me again."
Rise from the ashes,5,489,Ema,Wow! Look at the size of Chief Gant's desk!
Rise from the ashes,5,490,Phoenix,"(Speaking of that, when we were here earlier...)"
Rise from the ashes,5,491,Gant,"Oh, it's you two."
Rise from the ashes,5,492,Phoenix,Chief Gant! (He put that paper he was reading in his desk.)
Rise from the ashes,5,493,Phoenix,I wonder what he was reading?
Rise from the ashes,5,494,Gumshoe,This looks like a list of evidence... used in a case.
Rise from the ashes,5,495,Phoenix,A list of evidence?
Rise from the ashes,5,496,Gumshoe,In most cases the list runs twice as long as this.
Rise from the ashes,5,497,Ema,"Hey, look at the case name!"
Rise from the ashes,5,498,Gumshoe,"Huh? ""SL-9 Incident""! I wonder what this is doing here..."
Rise from the ashes,5,499,Phoenix,"Hold on, Detective! What did you just say?"
Rise from the ashes,5,500,Gumshoe,"I said, ""I wonder what..."""
Rise from the ashes,5,501,Phoenix,"No, about evidence lists. Normally they're twice as long?"
Rise from the ashes,5,502,Gumshoe,That's right. I guess there wasn't a lot of evidence.
Rise from the ashes,5,503,Phoenix,(A half-sized list of evidence...)
Rise from the ashes,5,504,Edgeworth,That list of evidence. It seems too short. Most lists... run twice as long.
Rise from the ashes,5,505,Phoenix,(What would the other half of the list be doing here?)
Rise from the ashes,5,506,Ema,I knew it! The Chief must be hiding something about that case!
Rise from the ashes,5,507,Phoenix,It would appear so.
Rise from the ashes,5,508,Phoenix,"This is a safe, isn't it?"
Rise from the ashes,5,509,Gumshoe,"""Safe""... that word is ripe with intrigue!"
Rise from the ashes,5,510,Phoenix,"Uh, okay. If you say so..."
Rise from the ashes,5,511,Ema,It looks like a code needs to be entered in this panel to open it.
Rise from the ashes,5,512,Phoenix,(A seven-digit number. I think I just might know what it is...)
Rise from the ashes,5,513,Gumshoe,Do you know what it is?
Rise from the ashes,5,514,Phoenix,I have a hunch...
Rise from the ashes,5,515,Gumshoe,"Oh, I know! You want to try my birth date? It's..."
Rise from the ashes,5,516,Phoenix,(I have a better idea. Here goes nothing.)
Rise from the ashes,5,517,_,Code confirmed. Access granted.
Rise from the ashes,5,518,Phoenix,Bingo.
Rise from the ashes,5,519,Ema,What number did you enter!?
Rise from the ashes,5,520,Gumshoe,"Whose birthday was that, pal?"
Rise from the ashes,5,521,Phoenix,"""7777777."" The final ID card number on that record."
Rise from the ashes,5,522,Ema,What?
Rise from the ashes,5,523,Phoenix,"The number of the mysterious ""executive officer"" who entered the room that day."
Rise from the ashes,5,524,Gumshoe,"You mean, ""Sevensevensevensevensevenseven""? That ID number!?"
Rise from the ashes,5,525,Phoenix,"I think you're one ""seven"" shy this time. This can only mean one thing: That's Chief Gant's ID number!"
Rise from the ashes,5,526,Ema,Say... Anyone care to look inside?
Rise from the ashes,5,527,Gumshoe,Is there any money in there? How much does he have stashed away!?
Rise from the ashes,5,528,Ema,Look! It's a... a...
Rise from the ashes,5,529,Gumshoe,a shard from a broken cup.
Rise from the ashes,5,530,Phoenix,(This somehow looks familiar. Where have I seen this before...?)
Rise from the ashes,5,531,Ema,There's something else in here too.
Rise from the ashes,5,532,Phoenix,What's this? It looks like a piece of leather cloth...
Rise from the ashes,5,533,Ema,"This is a handprint, isn't it?"
Rise from the ashes,5,534,Gumshoe,Hey! I saw someone wearing a shirt like that once! You think the Chief made up the design?
Rise from the ashes,5,535,Ema,Uh... I don't think so.
Rise from the ashes,5,536,Gumshoe,"Oh. Well, it was just a thought."
Rise from the ashes,5,537,Ema,Is that it? This is all that was in the safe?
Rise from the ashes,5,538,Phoenix,Apparently so. It's empty now.
Rise from the ashes,5,539,Gumshoe,"A piece of cloth with a handprint on it, and a broken shard from a cup."
Rise from the ashes,5,540,Phoenix,"They look like pieces of evidence,"
Rise from the ashes,5,541,Gumshoe,"but unless you can prove they have something to do with this case, I'm afraid I can't just let you take them. After all, it's my neck on the line here!"
Rise from the ashes,5,542,Phoenix,"(Great. Now I have to prove their ""relevancy"" to get them. How are these two items related to the SL-9 Incident?)"
Rise from the ashes,5,543,Ema,Come on! There's got to be something we can show the detective!
Rise from the ashes,5,544,Phoenix,Detective Gumshoe. I'd like you to have a look at this.
Rise from the ashes,5,545,Gumshoe,"Hey, I know what that is! So, you want to take some fingerprints?"
Rise from the ashes,5,546,Ema,"That's a great idea, Detective!"
Rise from the ashes,5,547,Gumshoe,"All right, go to town. Sheesh! ..."
Rise from the ashes,5,548,Ema,...
Rise from the ashes,5,549,Phoenix,What are you doing? Why are you sticking out your hand like that?
Rise from the ashes,5,550,Gumshoe,Go ahead. Take my fingerprints.
Rise from the ashes,5,551,Ema,"... Um, it's not your fingerprints we want to take."
Rise from the ashes,5,552,Gumshoe,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,5,553,Phoenix,"Come on, this isn't the time for jokes. We're talking about that cloth we found in the safe!"
Rise from the ashes,5,554,Gumshoe,"Oh! Heh heh! I knew that. The one with the hand print on it, right? Sheesh, where's your sense of humor?"
Rise from the ashes,5,555,Ema,"Okay, Mr. Wright. Let's check for prints! Sprinkle the powder on the cloth, then, once they've been absorbed into the prints, blow the rest away!"
Rise from the ashes,5,556,Phoenix,"(What are you, my mom? I don't have to be told a million times.) All right, let's get this over with!"
Rise from the ashes,5,557,_,Comparing... Comparison complete. Match found.
Rise from the ashes,5,558,Phoenix,(No... How can this be!? What are Ema's fingerprints doing here!?)
Rise from the ashes,5,559,Ema,"Hey, you found a match? Whose fingerprints were they!?"
Rise from the ashes,5,560,Phoenix,"Huh? Oh, uh... it seems the prints are too old. They aren't clear enough to get a match."
Rise from the ashes,5,561,Ema,Oh... That's too bad. I thought they'd be Darke's prints.
Rise from the ashes,5,562,Gumshoe,Psst! Hey you. Over here. What's going on here? What are that kid's prints doing inside the Chief's safe?
Rise from the ashes,5,563,Phoenix,Don't ask me! Let's just keep this information from Ema for now.
Rise from the ashes,5,564,Gumshoe,... Here. Maybe you should hold onto this.
Rise from the ashes,5,565,Phoenix,Detective Gumshoe. Could you have another look at this jar?
Rise from the ashes,5,566,Gumshoe,"All of us put that back together. Oh, those were the days..."
Rise from the ashes,5,567,Phoenix,(It's kind of early to be nostalgic.)
Rise from the ashes,5,568,Ema,Wasn't this jar a piece of evidence from that case?
Rise from the ashes,5,569,Gumshoe,"That's right. One of the shards had an ""SL-9 Incident"" sticker on it."
Rise from the ashes,5,570,Phoenix,"Doesn't this ring any bells? You know, that fragment we just found?"
Rise from the ashes,5,571,Gumshoe,"You mean this one, that was in the safe?"
Rise from the ashes,5,572,Ema,"Yes, that one... that was in the safe."
Rise from the ashes,5,573,Gumshoe,"... ! Now that you mention it, it's ringing a lot of bells! Let's see if it fits!"
Rise from the ashes,5,574,Phoenix,"Here, let me see that shard. I'll take a crack at this."
Rise from the ashes,5,575,Gumshoe,"Go ahead, pal. Show us what a rookie can do!"
Rise from the ashes,5,576,Ema,Mr. Wright! Here's some glue!
Rise from the ashes,5,577,Phoenix,(If I can piece this together again... it'll prove Chief Gant was knowingly hiding evidence! Here goes...)
Rise from the ashes,5,578,Phoenix,There! It fits like a charm. That of course means... Chief Gant willingly and knowingly hid a piece of this jar in his safe.
Rise from the ashes,5,579,Ema,!
Rise from the ashes,5,580,Phoenix,"In other words, he concealed a piece of evidence from the SL-9 Incident."
Rise from the ashes,5,581,Ema,But...
Rise from the ashes,5,582,Gumshoe,Hey guys! Get a load of this!
Rise from the ashes,5,583,Phoenix,What is it?
Rise from the ashes,5,584,Gumshoe,This piece you just attached... it's different from the others!
Rise from the ashes,5,585,Ema,There's a reddish line on it!
Rise from the ashes,5,586,Phoenix,(A reddish line... That's blood!)
Rise from the ashes,5,587,Gumshoe,I don't get it! Why would Chief Gant hide this in his safe?
Rise from the ashes,5,588,Gumshoe,Well? Was I any help?
Rise from the ashes,5,589,Phoenix,"Of course! Thanks to your ID card, we were able to get some hard evidence."
Rise from the ashes,5,590,Gant,"Now that's not very kind, is it? In other words, if it wasn't for his ID card, he would have been useless..."
Rise from the ashes,5,591,Gant,"Isn't that right, you in the coat?"
Rise from the ashes,5,592,Ema,EEEEEEEK!
Rise from the ashes,5,593,Gumshoe,C-Chief Gant!
Rise from the ashes,5,594,Phoenix,We didn't think you'd be back so soon.
Rise from the ashes,5,595,Gant,"Fortunately I'm a man who believes in signs. As I was walking to my meeting, I happened to look out a window and saw a stray dog run right into a pole. Just then I thought of a certain detective."
Rise from the ashes,5,596,Gumshoe,"Do you mean... m-me, sir?"
Rise from the ashes,5,597,Gant,"Now then, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you all to leave."
Rise from the ashes,5,598,Ema,Y-yes sir! Sorry...
Rise from the ashes,5,599,Gant,"Oh, you in the coat."
Rise from the ashes,5,600,Gumshoe,"Me, sir!?"
Rise from the ashes,5,601,Gant,Drop off your ID on the way out. You won't be needing it anymore.
Rise from the ashes,5,602,Gumshoe,But sir...
Rise from the ashes,5,603,Gant,Now get out!
Rise from the ashes,5,604,Gumshoe,Y-y-yes sir!
Rise from the ashes,5,605,Phoenix,"We'll be on our way too, then."
Rise from the ashes,5,606,Gant,"Wait. You, the one without the spiky hair. Don't go yet."
Rise from the ashes,5,607,Ema,"M-me, sir!?"
Rise from the ashes,5,608,Gant,I'd like a word with you.
Rise from the ashes,5,609,Ema,But sir! I'm not a licensed scientific investigator yet!
Rise from the ashes,5,610,Gant,You with the spiky hair. You're free to go.
Rise from the ashes,5,611,Ema,M-Mr. Wright!!!
Rise from the ashes,5,612,Gumshoe,"Look, pal! If I've told you once I've told you a thousand times..."
Rise from the ashes,5,613,Gumshoe,"The Chief's office is off limits! But no, you just had to go sneaking in there like that, didn't you!?"
Rise from the ashes,5,614,Phoenix,I thought you said you didn't care anymore if you were fired.
Rise from the ashes,5,615,Gumshoe,"Yeah, but if I knew it'd be like this, I never would've said it!"
Rise from the ashes,5,616,Phoenix,(Now that I've seen the evidence Chief Gant was hiding in his office... I think I'm finally starting to get the picture... It's hard to believe anyone could keep quiet about it all this time...)
Rise from the ashes,5,617,Gumshoe,"Anyway, you listenin' to me!? I'm gonna try to smooth things over with the Chief again! Later, pal!"
Rise from the ashes,5,618,Phoenix,"After that, I heard from Ema. She said the police want to ask her some questions, so she'll be busy for the rest of the day..."
Rise from the ashes,5,619,Lana,I see. So the Chief asked Ema to come in for questioning...
Rise from the ashes,5,620,Phoenix,"It's no use thinking about it. Tomorrow's the final day in court. I'm committed to doing everything I can to defend you, which is why I'm here."
Rise from the ashes,5,621,Lana,But I've already told you all I can...
Rise from the ashes,5,622,Phoenix,"What you've told me over these past couple of days... is absolutely nothing. Not a single, useful thing."
Rise from the ashes,5,623,Lana,Really? I believe I did mention something quite important. Something I told you right at the beginning. I said that I was the one who stabbed Detective Goodman.
Rise from the ashes,5,624,Phoenix,"You know, I think I've finally figured it out... Who it is you're hiding behind those words."
Rise from the ashes,5,625,Lana,... Mia did a good job mentoring you. I'm rather jealous...
Rise from the ashes,5,626,Phoenix,!
Rise from the ashes,5,627,Lana,It seems Edgeworth was right.
Rise from the ashes,5,628,Phoenix,Edgeworth...?
Rise from the ashes,5,629,Lana,"Once you're convinced you know something, no one can persuade you otherwise. ""Thick headed"" is the term he used, I believe."
Rise from the ashes,5,630,Phoenix,(Now's my chance to get her to tell me the rest of the story!)
Rise from the ashes,5,631,Phoenix,"I have to admit I was more than a little perplexed at first. You insisted you ""did it,"" yet there was no incriminating evidence. That's when it hit me. It's not that you're unwilling to tell the truth, it's that you're incapable of doing so, because of a certain individual."
Rise from the ashes,5,632,Lana,"What an intriguing notion. A certain, ""individual,"" you say? So you think I'm... protecting this person?"
Rise from the ashes,5,633,Phoenix,"Protecting? No. I think ""afraid of"" is more like it."
Rise from the ashes,5,634,Lana,!
Rise from the ashes,5,635,Phoenix,"If I'm not mistaken, the person in question may have persuaded you to silence."
Rise from the ashes,5,636,Lana,"... For argument's sake, Mr. Wright, whom may I ask is this person you're speaking of? The one I am supposedly so ""frightened"" of? What is this person's name?"
Rise from the ashes,5,637,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,5,638,Phoenix,"Well, Ms. Skye?"
Rise from the ashes,5,639,Lana,... Mr. Wright. You are addressing the Chief Prosecutor. Do not forget your place.
Rise from the ashes,5,640,Phoenix,(I take it she's still not ready to spill the beans.)
Rise from the ashes,5,641,Lana,My apologies. Could you please tell me a bit more about the circumstances?
Rise from the ashes,5,642,Lana,We were partners until two years ago. I respected him as a detective.
Rise from the ashes,5,643,Phoenix,"Assuming he is respectable, then tell me something... Why would he try to hide his crimes?"
Rise from the ashes,5,644,Lana,"His ""crimes""...?"
Rise from the ashes,5,645,Phoenix,"Both you and Edgeworth will be brought before a board of inquiry for what you did. Specifically, hiding and forging evidence."
Rise from the ashes,5,646,Lana,"Of course, these are serious offenses..."
Rise from the ashes,5,647,Phoenix,"Why is it, though, that Chief Gant's name was never mentioned?"
Rise from the ashes,5,648,Lana,Chief Gant...?
Rise from the ashes,5,649,Phoenix,Edgeworth didn't know the truth behind the forgery. The only party who could have possibly investigated that evidence was...
Rise from the ashes,5,650,Lana,Me. I had access because I was second in command of that investigation.
Rise from the ashes,5,651,Phoenix,"Yes you, but also one other: Damon Gant."
Rise from the ashes,5,652,Lana,"... If you intend to accuse Chief Gant, you'll need more than just words. Show me proof that Chief Gant falsified evidence in that case!"
Rise from the ashes,5,653,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,5,654,Phoenix,"I just found this in a safe in the Chief's office. This jar piece, and this strip of cloth. Do you know what these are? They're pieces of evidence from the SL-9 Incident!"
Rise from the ashes,5,655,Lana,I...
Rise from the ashes,5,656,Phoenix,The person concealing evidence was none other than Chief Gant himself. Now tell me! Why are you taking all the blame for him!?
Rise from the ashes,5,657,Lana,"... TouchÃ©, Mr. Wright. It's as you surmised. I cannot disobey the Chief's orders... even if it means being found guilty for murder."
Rise from the ashes,5,658,Phoenix,Why not?
Rise from the ashes,5,659,Lana,"Come now, Mr. Wright. You can't possibly expect me to be able to tell you that. Three days ago... I had no choice but to cooperate."
Rise from the ashes,5,660,Phoenix,(In the murder of Detective Goodman!)
Rise from the ashes,5,661,Lana,"Or perhaps I should say, ""follow orders."" Yes, that's more accurate than ""cooperate."""
Rise from the ashes,5,662,Lana,"Although I can't tell you the details, I can say that I was given an order that day."
Rise from the ashes,5,663,Phoenix,Just as I suspected. Despite what everyone believes... you were not the one who murdered Detective Goodman!
Rise from the ashes,5,664,Lana,Correct. I was trying to take the body out of Edgeworth's car. The trunk was broken. I discovered that murder weapon while inspecting the body.
Rise from the ashes,5,665,Phoenix,"The murder weapon... You mean, Edgeworth's knife?"
Rise from the ashes,5,666,Lana,"No. When I found the body, this was the knife stuck in it."
Rise from the ashes,5,667,Phoenix,(The knife from the SL-9 Incident... serial killer Joe Darke's knife!)
Rise from the ashes,5,668,Lana,"I couldn't just leave that knife in him, so I took it out and stabbed him with another knife."
Rise from the ashes,5,669,Phoenix,That would be Edgeworth's knife?
Rise from the ashes,5,670,Lana,"That's right. Even though he was already dead, my hands were shaking at the thought of stabbing him. That's why I ended up cutting my hand."
Rise from the ashes,5,671,Phoenix,And that is the reason for the bandage on your right hand?
Rise from the ashes,5,672,Lana,Yes. It seems that I got blood on the victim's shoes as well. And then... she saw me just as I plunged the knife in.
Rise from the ashes,5,673,Phoenix,(Ms. Starr...) Why did you need to hide Darke's knife so badly?
Rise from the ashes,5,674,Lana,It took a lot of work to finally close the Darke case two years ago. It was over with. I didn't ever want it to be opened again. My intent was to prevent that by whatever means possible.
Rise from the ashes,5,675,Phoenix,So... you hid Darke's knife?
Rise from the ashes,5,676,Lana,"The weapon used to stab the detective was evidence in the Joe Darke case... If word got out, which it would, the reporters would have a field day with that."
Rise from the ashes,5,677,Phoenix,"So you wrapped the knife in your scarf, and hid it. In Edgeworth's exhaust pipe..."
Rise from the ashes,5,678,Lana,"Right. Then I called my sister, to tell her what happened, and to ask her to hide the knife that was inside my muffler."
Rise from the ashes,5,679,Phoenix,You asked Ema?
Rise from the ashes,5,680,Lana,I didn't want anyone on the force to know about this.
Rise from the ashes,5,681,Phoenix,(That would explain why Ema is so confident... about Lana's innocence!)
Rise from the ashes,5,682,Lana,"Speaking of phone calls, I had a bad feeling about one of them that day."
Rise from the ashes,5,683,Phoenix,A bad feeling?
Rise from the ashes,5,684,Lana,"The truth is, after I received those orders from Chief Gant. The first thing I did was make a phone call. A phone call to Patrolman Jake Marshall."
Rise from the ashes,5,685,Phoenix,To Marshall? Why on earth would you call him?
Rise from the ashes,5,686,Lana,"The lead investigator for the SL-9 Incident had been murdered. I wanted that fact to be kept hidden, and I needed help. He was the only other person I could trust. Or at least, I thought I could trust him at the time. However, it seems that after I spoke to him he went off on an escapade of his own..."
Rise from the ashes,5,687,Phoenix,Oh! You mean...
Rise from the ashes,5,688,Lana,"Not wanting the case to die, he decided to take things into his own hands."
Rise from the ashes,5,689,Phoenix,(He disguised himself as Officer Goodman and tried to steal the evidence!)
Rise from the ashes,5,690,Lana,"He had already stolen the ID card... but it seems he still hadn't made up his mind to break into the evidence room. After my phone call, any remaining doubts he had must have disappeared."
Rise from the ashes,5,691,Phoenix,So your phone call caused the incident in the evidence room!?
Rise from the ashes,5,692,Lana,I'm afraid that's all I can tell you.
Rise from the ashes,5,693,Phoenix,But Lana...
Rise from the ashes,5,694,Lana,"You've earned my respect, Mr. Wright. Both as a defense attorney and an investigator. Now please... Don't pursue this any further in court tomorrow!"
Rise from the ashes,5,695,Phoenix,(Tomorrow's trial... There's only one way to drive off Lana's demons...)
Rise from the ashes,5,696,Phoenix,(I've got to get to the bottom of everything! Detective Goodman's real murderer... and what went down in the Chief's office two years ago...)
Rise from the ashes,6,0,Phoenix,"(This is the Defendant Lobby all right... but there's no defendant. I've been trying to reach Lana all morning. Where could she be? And where's Ema, for that matter? It almost seems as if...)"
Rise from the ashes,6,1,Edgeworth,Something's been happening behind the scenes...
Rise from the ashes,6,2,Phoenix,Edgeworth!
Rise from the ashes,6,3,Edgeworth,"Knowing you, you've already figured it out... Who the owner of the ""7777777"" ID number is."
Rise from the ashes,6,4,Phoenix,Well... I have a pretty strong hunch. (Looks like I'm not the only one who's figured it out.)
Rise from the ashes,6,5,Edgeworth,"You know, the only reason this trial didn't reach a verdict yesterday... is because there was still room for doubt on this ID record. If that number does belong to whom you suspect, then no doubt will remain. After all, he hasn't been officially charged with anything."
Rise from the ashes,6,6,Phoenix,True... Not yet.
Rise from the ashes,6,7,Edgeworth,"In any event, once all doubt has been removed from that list, I can call for a ruling on the defendant. Five minutes after the trial starts... Lana will be found guilty."
Rise from the ashes,6,8,Phoenix,But she didn't do it!
Rise from the ashes,6,9,Edgeworth,I figured you'd say as much. That's why I came here... to hear what you have to say.
Rise from the ashes,6,10,Phoenix,"(This is the first time he's ever done something like this...) Lana's hiding something, and the only way we'll ever know the truth... is to draw it out of her."
Rise from the ashes,6,11,Edgeworth,"The ""truth""?"
Rise from the ashes,6,12,Phoenix,Everything goes back to the SL-9 Incident.
Rise from the ashes,6,13,Edgeworth,Don't be stupid! Today's the last day of the trial. We don't have time to reminisce about the past!
Rise from the ashes,6,14,Phoenix,That depends on you.
Rise from the ashes,6,15,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,16,Phoenix,"If she's found guilty, you'll lose your only chance to find out what really happened."
Rise from the ashes,6,17,Edgeworth,"... I'll think about it. See you in court, Wright."
Rise from the ashes,6,18,Phoenix,"(This is it. If I'm ever going to find out what Chief Gant has on her, it's now!)"
Rise from the ashes,6,19,Judge,Court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye.
Rise from the ashes,6,20,Phoenix,"The defense is ready, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,6,21,Edgeworth,"The prosecution is ready, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,6,22,Judge,"Normally this is when the prosecution puts forth its opening statement,"
Rise from the ashes,6,23,Edgeworth,?
Rise from the ashes,6,24,Judge,"but before that, the police chief has a proposal to make."
Rise from the ashes,6,25,Phoenix,(Chief Gant...!)
Rise from the ashes,6,26,Gant,"Mornin' folks. How's everyone doing? Hey, Udgey. Been back to the pool yet?"
Rise from the ashes,6,27,Judge,"No, I've been drowning enough as it is in my work."
Rise from the ashes,6,28,Gant,Ho! That's a good one! Don't think I can top that!
Rise from the ashes,6,29,Edgeworth,"If you don't mind me asking, Chief, exactly what is this ""proposal"" of yours?"
Rise from the ashes,6,30,Gant,"Lana... that is to say, the defendant, has asked me if she could speak directly to the court."
Rise from the ashes,6,31,Phoenix,(She wants to do what!?)
Rise from the ashes,6,32,Gant,"Having heard what she intends to say, I feel she should be granted her request. In the end, it should save everyone a lot of time and trouble."
Rise from the ashes,6,33,Edgeworth,"What's this all about, defendant?"
Rise from the ashes,6,34,Lana,"I'd just like to make one simple request, and I'll be finished."
Rise from the ashes,6,35,Judge,Well then? What's your request?
Rise from the ashes,6,36,Lana,"Your Honor, I'd like you to put an immediate end to this trial."
Rise from the ashes,6,37,Phoenix,Huh!?
Rise from the ashes,6,38,Lana,"I confess to all charges against me. On February 21 of this year, I murdered Detective Bruce Goodman... in the underground parking lot of the Prosecutor's Office."
Rise from the ashes,6,39,Phoenix,"No, Lana!"
Rise from the ashes,6,40,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,41,Phoenix,You can't! Your Honor. The defendant's claim does not change the defense's plea!
Rise from the ashes,6,42,Lana,"In that case, Mr. Wright, I no longer require your services."
Rise from the ashes,6,43,Phoenix,But Lana!
Rise from the ashes,6,44,Lana,"Your Honor. I hereby forfeit my right to an attorney. The prosecution may lack direct evidence against me, but it has sufficiently proven its case through testimony and circumstantial evidence. I would like you to render your verdict now, if you please."
Rise from the ashes,6,45,Judge,"Hmm... Well, the defendant certainly has the right to self representation... Her request is legally valid, although this is an unprecedented situation. Indeed, it appears there's no need to continue this trial... even if Mr. Wright may feel otherwise."
Rise from the ashes,6,46,Phoenix,(This can't be happening!)
Rise from the ashes,6,47,Judge,It appears the time for the verdict has arrived. This court finds the defendant...
Rise from the ashes,6,48,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,49,Edgeworth,"One moment, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,6,50,Judge,M-Mr. Edgeworth!?
Rise from the ashes,6,51,Edgeworth,The prosecution has not yet proven the defendant guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Any ruling at this stage would certainly be premature.
Rise from the ashes,6,52,Gant,"Come now, Worthy. I understand this is a difficult time for you, but why don't you just be a good little boy and keep your mouth shut, hmm?"
Rise from the ashes,6,53,Edgeworth,Hmph. I don't think I care for your tone... Chief Gant.
Rise from the ashes,6,54,Gant,What?
Rise from the ashes,6,55,Edgeworth,"Creating another fabrication to cover up your past mistakes... Sorry, but I'm no longer the naive little ""boy"" you would have me be."
Rise from the ashes,6,56,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,6,57,Edgeworth,With this sudden confession from the defendant... It's obvious to me some kind of deal was struck behind the scenes.
Rise from the ashes,6,58,Gant,"Some kind of ""deal,"" hm? Not everyone operates as you do... Worthy."
Rise from the ashes,6,59,Edgeworth,... Hmph. I thought so. Your Honor. The prosecution would like to change its first witness.
Rise from the ashes,6,60,Judge,Oh? To whom...?
Rise from the ashes,6,61,Edgeworth,"As its first witness, the prosecution would like to call... Ms. Ema Skye! I request the court hears her tesimony!"
Rise from the ashes,6,62,Lana,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,63,Lana,Mr. Edgeworth! I am exercising my right to self representation. I don't think we need to contin-
Rise from the ashes,6,64,Edgeworth,"I don't care what you think, Ms. Skye."
Rise from the ashes,6,65,Lana,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,66,Edgeworth,"The exposure of truth sometimes results in tragedy... However! No matter how tragic the truth may be, it would be an even greater tragedy... to avert one's eyes from it."
Rise from the ashes,6,67,Judge,"Very well. The court shall grant the prosecution's request. That's okay with you, right Chief Gant?"
Rise from the ashes,6,68,Gant,Worthy... You'll live to regret this. Mark my words.
Rise from the ashes,6,69,Edgeworth,Ms. Ema Skye. Please take the stand.
Rise from the ashes,6,70,Phoenix,(Looks like Edgeworth has decided to take the horse by the reins!)
Rise from the ashes,6,71,Edgeworth,"Now then, witness. Please state your name and occupation."
Rise from the ashes,6,72,Ema,"Um... M-my name is Ema. Ema Skye. My occupation? I'm Lana's little sister, and I want to be a scientific investigator!"
Rise from the ashes,6,73,Edgeworth,"Two years ago... you encountered the serial killer Joe Darke, of the ""Joe Darke Killings."" Is this correct?"
Rise from the ashes,6,74,Ema,"Yes. I'm trying my hardest to forget about that, though..."
Rise from the ashes,6,75,Edgeworth,"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to recall those events one more time."
Rise from the ashes,6,76,Judge,Mr. Edgeworth. Please remember this trial concerns the murder of Detective Goodman. Is an incident that was resolved two years ago really all that relevant?
Rise from the ashes,6,77,Edgeworth,Yes. It most certainly is.
Rise from the ashes,6,78,Judge,...
Rise from the ashes,6,79,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,6,80,Judge,W-well okay then!
Rise from the ashes,6,81,Phoenix,(He sure gave in fast...)
Rise from the ashes,6,82,Edgeworth,Now... please testify about what happened to you two years ago.
Rise from the ashes,6,83,Phoenix,(The trip to yesteryear has finally begun... It's bound to lead to the truth behind this trial!)
Rise from the ashes,6,84,Judge,It's a good thing you weren't harmed.
Rise from the ashes,6,85,Ema,I passed out... I don't remember much.
Rise from the ashes,6,86,Judge,"That's understandable. However... please tell me, Mr. Edgeworth. What does this testimony have to do with Detective Goodman's murder?"
Rise from the ashes,6,87,Edgeworth,"... That will soon become apparent, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,6,88,Phoenix,"(You've got to admire him for his courage, considering he has no evidence...)"
Rise from the ashes,6,89,Judge,Very well! The defense may begin its cross examination.
Rise from the ashes,6,90,Ema,I was waiting in my sister's office that day.
Rise from the ashes,6,91,Phoenix,"Two years ago, the defendant was a detective at the Police Department, correct?"
Rise from the ashes,6,92,Ema,Yes. She was second in command under Chief Detective Gant. My sister... She was the best detective ever!
Rise from the ashes,6,93,Judge,"Yes, I remember. Chief Detective Gant and Ms. Skye used to be quite the pair."
Rise from the ashes,6,94,Edgeworth,I believe they shared the same office.
Rise from the ashes,6,95,Ema,"That's right. I'd always sit at my sister's desk, and dream about playing that organ. I wanted to play it that day, too..."
Rise from the ashes,6,96,Edgeworth,The Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office held a ceremony that day.
Rise from the ashes,6,97,Ema,Lana promised to take me to dinner after she finished her work.
Rise from the ashes,6,98,Ema,"A man came running in, and took me hostage."
Rise from the ashes,6,99,Phoenix,"A ""man""...?"
Rise from the ashes,6,100,Ema,"Yes, Joe Darke. He was a... a serial killer."
Rise from the ashes,6,101,Edgeworth,Joe Darke was brought in for questioning on the day of that ceremony. We were desperate to get anything on him that would lead to an arrest.
Rise from the ashes,6,102,Judge,"When he saw his chance... he fled the room, right?"
Rise from the ashes,6,103,Edgeworth,"Upon fleeing the room, Darke proceeded to take the elevator. He must have been in a panic because the elevator was going up. Then he ran into Skye and Gant's office."
Rise from the ashes,6,104,Ema,"There was a lot of noise coming from outside, so I... opened up the door to have a look. That's when I saw... Him."
Rise from the ashes,6,105,Ema,"Neil Marshall rescued me,"
Rise from the ashes,6,106,Phoenix,What was the prosecutor doing there?
Rise from the ashes,6,107,Edgeworth,"That day, there were two people present during Darke's questioning: Detective Damon Gant, and Prosecutor Neil Marshall."
Rise from the ashes,6,108,Phoenix,(Gant was there too...?)
Rise from the ashes,6,109,Edgeworth,"Neil Marshall had just received the King of Prosecutors award. Young and dedicated, he went straight to the questioning room after the ceremony."
Rise from the ashes,6,110,Judge,I assume that would also be why he was the first to run after Darke.
Rise from the ashes,6,111,Ema,"When Darke grabbed me, I... I thought I was as good as dead."
Rise from the ashes,6,112,Phoenix,And that's when Prosecutor Marshall came running in?
Rise from the ashes,6,113,Ema,I... I don't clearly remember what happened then. But...
Rise from the ashes,6,114,Ema,but I'll never forget what I saw that instant!
Rise from the ashes,6,115,Phoenix,Can you tell us about that?
Rise from the ashes,6,116,Ema,Mr. Marshall jumped on Darke. Just then... the lights went out.
Rise from the ashes,6,117,Judge,The lights?
Rise from the ashes,6,118,Ema,"It was just about this time of year... There was a terrible storm going on, and lightning struck nearby."
Rise from the ashes,6,119,Phoenix,So the electricity went out?
Rise from the ashes,6,120,Judge,"Wait a minute... If it was pitch dark in that room... you shouldn't have been able to see anything, right?"
Rise from the ashes,6,121,Ema,"Right, but just then lightning flashed again outside. That sudden flash left an unforgettable image of the scene in my mind..."
Rise from the ashes,6,122,Judge,I see...
Rise from the ashes,6,123,Ema,I told the detective about what I saw then.
Rise from the ashes,6,124,Phoenix,The detective?
Rise from the ashes,6,125,Ema,Yes. Detective Goodman. He was in charge of the case.
Rise from the ashes,6,126,Phoenix,(Detective Bruce Goodman... The victim...)
Rise from the ashes,6,127,Phoenix,So you spoke with Detective Goodman about this... two years ago.
Rise from the ashes,6,128,Ema,Yes. That's what's so scary about this trial.
Rise from the ashes,6,129,Edgeworth,And you told Detective Goodman about what you saw?
Rise from the ashes,6,130,Ema,"Yes, but... at the time, the words just wouldn't come out. That's why I drew a picture."
Rise from the ashes,6,131,Phoenix,"(A picture... Yes, I think she mentioned that before.)"
Rise from the ashes,6,132,Judge,"Well, Mr. Wright? Have you heard enough?"
Rise from the ashes,6,133,Phoenix,The picture the witness drew... I believe it has a very important meaning.
Rise from the ashes,6,134,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,135,Edgeworth,But the list of evidence I was given two years ago didn't contain a picture...
Rise from the ashes,6,136,Judge,Witness. Would you mind if we added this statement to your testimony?
Rise from the ashes,6,137,Ema,"Y-yes, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,6,138,Ema,I drew a picture of that scene once... but it seems to have been lost.
Rise from the ashes,6,139,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,140,Phoenix,"You drew a picture of the scene you witnessed, right?"
Rise from the ashes,6,141,Ema,Yes. I wanted to do everything I could to help the investigation. I can still see it now... Whenever I close my eyes...
Rise from the ashes,6,142,Edgeworth,"That's strange... I took over the case after Prosecutor Marshall died, yet I never received any picture. Perhaps the witness is mistaken?"
Rise from the ashes,6,143,Ema,B-but I did draw it! I swear! I'm not just imagining it...
Rise from the ashes,6,144,Phoenix,(This picture that Ema drew... that reminds me! I guess I should check the evidence again...)
Rise from the ashes,6,145,Edgeworth,Well anyway. Let's continue. This scene that imprinted an image in your mind... Can you please describe it to us?
Rise from the ashes,6,146,Ema,The man...
Rise from the ashes,6,147,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,148,Phoenix,Mr. Edgeworth. This little girl put all her heart into drawing that picture... and yet you still insist on denying its existence?
Rise from the ashes,6,149,Edgeworth,"Huh!? Hey, I'm not the bad guy! All I'm saying is that as the prosecutor for that case, I wasn't handed such a picture!"
Rise from the ashes,6,150,Phoenix,That may well be... but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Behold!
Rise from the ashes,6,151,Judge,This is... the evidence list for the SL-9 Incident?
Rise from the ashes,6,152,Phoenix,"Please turn it over, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,6,153,Judge,Turn it over...? Turn... it... AAAAAAAHHHH! What's this!?
Rise from the ashes,6,154,Edgeworth,"Yes, what is that?"
Rise from the ashes,6,155,Ema,Hey! That's it! That's the picture I drew!
Rise from the ashes,6,156,Judge,Indeed... Two men appear to be wrestling here.
Rise from the ashes,6,157,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,158,Edgeworth,What's the meaning of this!? What are you doing with that list!?
Rise from the ashes,6,159,Phoenix,Me...?
Rise from the ashes,6,160,Edgeworth,Only the prosecutor in charge should have access to that list!
Rise from the ashes,6,161,Judge,Huh...? These lists... They're... They're different from each other.
Rise from the ashes,6,162,Edgeworth,What?
Rise from the ashes,6,163,Judge,"It would appear, Mr. Edgeworth, that the evidence list you were handed two years ago... was incomplete. These two lists... fit together to form one. You can see the marks here, where they were torn apart from each other."
Rise from the ashes,6,164,Phoenix,"So you see, Mr. Edgeworth. It's quite obvious what happened. Two years ago... only half of the evidence in that case ever reached you."
Rise from the ashes,6,165,Edgeworth,What... WWWHHAAAAAATTTTTT!!!!????
Rise from the ashes,6,166,Judge,Order! Order! Who'd have thought the picture would have been drawn on the back of the list...
Rise from the ashes,6,167,Ema,That was handed to Detective Goodman in the questioning room?
Rise from the ashes,6,168,Phoenix,"(Wait a minute... If this list was torn in half, then that means...) Your Honor!"
Rise from the ashes,6,169,Judge,"Are you all right, Mr. Wright? Your eyes are bulging from your head..."
Rise from the ashes,6,170,Phoenix,If the evidence list was torn in half... then there might be more of the drawing on the back of Mr. Edgeworth's list!
Rise from the ashes,6,171,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,172,Judge,"Yes, that's quite conceivable. Mr. Edgeworth?"
Rise from the ashes,6,173,Edgeworth,It's possible. Let's see... MM! MMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!
Rise from the ashes,6,174,Judge,Is something wrong?
Rise from the ashes,6,175,Phoenix,(Do you even have to ask?)
Rise from the ashes,6,176,Edgeworth,"Sorry, Your Honor. There is something drawn on the back of my list. This is that... thing!"
Rise from the ashes,6,177,Judge,... That's that... that thing! That thing that was dancing in the evidence room!
Rise from the ashes,6,178,Edgeworth,Apparently the Head of Criminal Affairs used this for his blueprint.
Rise from the ashes,6,179,Phoenix,(I guess he was out of scrap paper...)
Rise from the ashes,6,180,Ema,...
Rise from the ashes,6,181,Judge,Very well. Witness. Will you please testify about this picture you drew two years ago?
Rise from the ashes,6,182,Ema,"...Huh? Oh, Y-yes sir, Your Honor!"
Rise from the ashes,6,183,Phoenix,(What's wrong with Ema? She seemed to be thinking about something when she saw the picture.)
Rise from the ashes,6,184,Judge,To think a flash of lightning could burn such an image in your mind...
Rise from the ashes,6,185,Phoenix,"(Thanks to that though, she was able to show us exactly what she saw!)"
Rise from the ashes,6,186,Judge,"Well, I don't see any contradictions here. This clearly shows Joe Darke about to murder Prosecutor Neil Marshall."
Rise from the ashes,6,187,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,6,188,Judge,The defense may now begin its cross-examination.
Rise from the ashes,6,189,Ema,This is the picture I drew two years ago.
Rise from the ashes,6,190,Phoenix,Did you draw this picture right after the incident?
Rise from the ashes,6,191,Ema,Um... I think I drew it two or three days later. At first I was in such a state of shock that I couldn't do anything...
Rise from the ashes,6,192,Edgeworth,During that time the detective team was reorganized. Detective Goodman was placed in charge... under the direction of Damon Gant and Lana Skye.
Rise from the ashes,6,193,Phoenix,(Two or three days later... The memory should still have been fresh in her mind.)
Rise from the ashes,6,194,Judge,"Excuse me, witness, but can you please tell us why this picture is painted all black?"
Rise from the ashes,6,195,Ema,The flash of lightning was so bright all I could see were shadows.
Rise from the ashes,6,196,Phoenix,So at the time you didn't even know it was Mr. Marshall who had come to your rescue?
Rise from the ashes,6,197,Ema,No... I couldn't see him clearly. The lightning was so bright... and I was knocked to the floor.
Rise from the ashes,6,198,Phoenix,You were knocked to the floor?
Rise from the ashes,6,199,Ema,"Darke had a tight grip on me, but when Mr. Marshall jumped on him, I was knocked away. I turned around, and that's when the lightning flashed."
Rise from the ashes,6,200,Phoenix,(Poor Ema... I'm just glad she wasn't hurt.)
Rise from the ashes,6,201,Edgeworth,What happened after the lightning flashed?
Rise from the ashes,6,202,Ema,After that I must have fainted.
Rise from the ashes,6,203,Phoenix,"You mean, you didn't see the actual murder take place?"
Rise from the ashes,6,204,Ema,No. I-I'm sorry...
Rise from the ashes,6,205,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,206,Edgeworth,"The flash of lightning only drove off the darkness for a split second. Not only that, but the trauma of the situation understandably caused the witness to faint. Do you really need to torture this girl any further!?"
Rise from the ashes,6,207,Phoenix,"What!? Hey, I'm not the bad guy here!"
Rise from the ashes,6,208,Ema,"Anyway, this picture..."
Rise from the ashes,6,209,Ema,This picture shows exactly what I saw that instant!
Rise from the ashes,6,210,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,211,Phoenix,"Sorry for asking so many times, but are you sure you drew exactly what you saw?"
Rise from the ashes,6,212,Ema,Of course! This is the exact scene!
Rise from the ashes,6,213,Phoenix,It wasn't influenced in any way from your talks with the detectives?
Rise from the ashes,6,214,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,215,Edgeworth,"Are you insinuating we somehow manipulated her memory, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,6,216,Phoenix,"No, no. Of course not. (I'd better watch out, or he might find some way to cut my salary!)"
Rise from the ashes,6,217,Ema,"I drew this picture before I heard anything from the detectives, so I don't think anyone's story would have influenced me..."
Rise from the ashes,6,218,Judge,Mr. Wright. Is there something that's bothering you about this picture?
Rise from the ashes,6,219,Phoenix,"Huh? Oh, well..."
Rise from the ashes,6,220,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,6,221,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,222,Phoenix,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this picture the witness drew... contains a blatant contradiction!"
Rise from the ashes,6,223,Ema,"What? B-but, I still remember it just like it was yesterday!"
Rise from the ashes,6,224,Judge,Mr. Wright. Perhaps it would be faster if you simply pointed out this contradiction for us. What part of this picture... contradicts the autopsy report?
Rise from the ashes,6,225,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,226,Phoenix,"The contradiction of course lies here! Take a look at the knife the man is holding. If you look closely, you can see its tip is broken!"
Rise from the ashes,6,227,Judge,"In fact, you don't even have to look closely to see that."
Rise from the ashes,6,228,Ema,"But Mr. Wright, look at the evidence! See the murder weapon? Its tip is broken too!"
Rise from the ashes,6,229,Judge,If I recall... the tip of the knife was found broken off in the victim's body.
Rise from the ashes,6,230,Ema,It was the conclusive piece of evidence that proved Joe Darke was the murderer!
Rise from the ashes,6,231,Phoenix,"I'm afraid it's not so simple, Ema."
Rise from the ashes,6,232,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,233,Edgeworth,Huh? Where could you possibly see a problem!?
Rise from the ashes,6,234,Phoenix,"It's obvious, really. The victim ""suffered a single stab wound in the back."" If the victim was only stabbed once, then the murder weapon should not yet be broken!"
Rise from the ashes,6,235,Judge,AAAAAAAHHHHHH! What's the meaning of this?
Rise from the ashes,6,236,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,237,Edgeworth,Perhaps the knife was broken beforehand!
Rise from the ashes,6,238,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,239,Phoenix,"Sorry, but I'm afraid that's not possible. The tip of the knife was found inside the victim's body. If it was broken beforehand, it couldn't possibly wind up there!"
Rise from the ashes,6,240,Judge,That's right! But what does this mean?
Rise from the ashes,6,241,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,242,Edgeworth,The tip of the knife was undeniably discovered within the victim's body! The only possible explanation is the witness's memory is mistaken!
Rise from the ashes,6,243,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,244,Phoenix,That's why I asked her so many times if she was sure she remembered correctly. I believe you were annoyed at the time. But she was sure she remembered correctly!
Rise from the ashes,6,245,Edgeworth,But... there's no other way to explain this inconsistency!
Rise from the ashes,6,246,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,247,Phoenix,"Not so fast, Mr. Edgeworth. There is another explanation. Have you forgotten already? About a little something called... ""falsified evidence""?"
Rise from the ashes,6,248,Edgeworth,"You're treading on thin ice, Wright..."
Rise from the ashes,6,249,Phoenix,"All I'm saying, is that this broken knife might be the piece of evidence that was forged! You can't deny the possibility!"
Rise from the ashes,6,250,Edgeworth,No... Aaaaaagh!
Rise from the ashes,6,251,Judge,Order! Order! Order! Are you saying the investigation really was corrupted?
Rise from the ashes,6,252,Phoenix,"Your Honor... Please allow me to once again go over the events that took place the day of the murder. The Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office were holding a ceremony that day. After receiving the King of Prosecutors award at the ceremony. Neil Marshall questioned Joe Darke along with Damon Gant. During his questioning, Joe Darke fled the room. Prosecutor Marshall chased after him... and was killed by Darke. It is my belief that somewhere in this story... there is a lie."
Rise from the ashes,6,253,Judge,Hmm...
Rise from the ashes,6,254,Ema,I... I'm not lying... The man really was holding up a broken knife!
Rise from the ashes,6,255,Edgeworth,... If that's true... then there's no other way around it. This could not have been the actual murder weapon.
Rise from the ashes,6,256,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,257,Edgeworth,There must have been another broken knife!
Rise from the ashes,6,258,Judge,What are the chances of there being two broken knives?
Rise from the ashes,6,259,Phoenix,(Another broken knife besides Joe Darke's... Could there have been one?)
Rise from the ashes,6,260,Phoenix,If the witness is this adamant about the accuracy of what she saw... it can't just be explained away by a simple observational error.
Rise from the ashes,6,261,Ema,Mr. Wright...
Rise from the ashes,6,262,Phoenix,In that instant... Ema really did see a broken knife!
Rise from the ashes,6,263,Judge,"I assume then, that you have some information about this ""other"" broken knife? If so, please feel free to enlighten us."
Rise from the ashes,6,264,Phoenix,(The murder weapon was already broken prior to the murder... There's only one way!) Take a look at this. Here's the real murder weapon!
Rise from the ashes,6,265,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,266,Phoenix,The answer lies in the past... Two years in the past. Right here inside this picture!
Rise from the ashes,6,267,Edgeworth,This is a picture of the awards ceremony. A-AAAAHH!
Rise from the ashes,6,268,Judge,"What is it, Mr. Edgeworth!?"
Rise from the ashes,6,269,Edgeworth,It's the... the broken murder weapon!
Rise from the ashes,6,270,Phoenix,Notice the award Prosecutor Marshall is holding.
Rise from the ashes,6,271,Ema,That's... a broken knife!
Rise from the ashes,6,272,Phoenix,"As we earlier concluded, the knife in the picture was not Joe Darke's knife. That being the case... the knife the witness saw, was in all likelihood this award!"
Rise from the ashes,6,273,Judge,Order! Order! Order!
Rise from the ashes,6,274,Phoenix,"Neil Marshall was awarded King of Prosecutors that day. As an award, he was given this broken shield and a broken knife. When he chased after Joe Darke, he pulled out this knife. Being a prosecutor, he did not carry a pistol. This broken knife was the only weapon he had in this dangerous situation."
Rise from the ashes,6,275,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,276,Edgeworth,But that... That can't be!
Rise from the ashes,6,277,Phoenix,"Oh? And why not, Mr. Edgeworth?"
Rise from the ashes,6,278,Edgeworth,Because if the King of Prosecutors award knife was the murder weapon... then the murderer and the victim would be reversed!
Rise from the ashes,6,279,Phoenix,What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,6,280,Edgeworth,I mean... This man raising a knife... would have been Prosecutor Neil Marshall!
Rise from the ashes,6,281,Phoenix,Oh... OOOOOHHHHH!!!
Rise from the ashes,6,282,Judge,But the prosecutor was the one who actually died!
Rise from the ashes,6,283,Phoenix,That's true... (What's going on here?)
Rise from the ashes,6,284,Edgeworth,It seems Mr. Wright has been a bit too eager to jump to conclusions...
Rise from the ashes,6,285,Ema,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,286,Ema,Wait! I... I remember now... I remember everything!
Rise from the ashes,6,287,Judge,Witness...?
Rise from the ashes,6,288,Ema,Mr. Edgeworth!
Rise from the ashes,6,289,Edgeworth,What is it?
Rise from the ashes,6,290,Ema,"Could you show me your evidence list again, please?"
Rise from the ashes,6,291,Judge,His list? The one with that... picture scribbled on the back?
Rise from the ashes,6,292,Ema,... I knew it... This picture... I'm the one who drew it.
Rise from the ashes,6,293,Edgeworth,What!?
Rise from the ashes,6,294,Phoenix,You drew that?
Rise from the ashes,6,295,Ema,That's right. The list wasn't torn in half at the time I drew this picture. All this time I've been trying so hard to forget... I must have locked this part away deep inside me...
Rise from the ashes,6,296,Judge,"Perhaps it would be best... if we added this to the witness's testimony. Would you please tell us what you've recalled, Ms. Skye?"
Rise from the ashes,6,297,Ema,"Yes, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,6,298,Phoenix,"(First the knife mix-up, and now... the Blue Badger? This should be interesting...)"
Rise from the ashes,6,299,Judge,This is certainly most unusual...
Rise from the ashes,6,300,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,301,Edgeworth,Try impossible! The Head Detective of Criminal Affairs didn't even design him until this year!
Rise from the ashes,6,302,Phoenix,(That would mean he didn't even exist two years ago...)
Rise from the ashes,6,303,Judge,"Yes, well. The defense may now begin its cross-examination."
Rise from the ashes,6,304,Lana,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,305,Lana,Stop! Please! Don't pursue this any further!
Rise from the ashes,6,306,Phoenix,Lana!
Rise from the ashes,6,307,Judge,What's the meaning of this!? Please remain seated in the defendant's chair!
Rise from the ashes,6,308,Lana,But you can't do this! I've already confessed to the crime! Why can't you just leave it at that!?
Rise from the ashes,6,309,Edgeworth,Chief Prosecutor Skye.
Rise from the ashes,6,310,Lana,!
Rise from the ashes,6,311,Edgeworth,We've already come this far. It's too late to turn back.
Rise from the ashes,6,312,Judge,Silence! The defense will now begin its cross-examination. Bailiff. Please detain the defendant.
Rise from the ashes,6,313,Phoenix,(It seems we're finally getting to the core of the matter.)
Rise from the ashes,6,314,Ema,When I saw that man raise his knife...
Rise from the ashes,6,315,Phoenix,"When you say, ""that man,"" I assume you refer to Joe Darke?"
Rise from the ashes,6,316,Ema,"Yes... at least, I think it was him."
Rise from the ashes,6,317,Phoenix,"You... ""think""?"
Rise from the ashes,6,318,Ema,All I could really see were shadows.
Rise from the ashes,6,319,Edgeworth,"The power outage that immediately preceded the incident, is also documented in the Prosecutor's Office reports."
Rise from the ashes,6,320,Judge,So then you...
Rise from the ashes,6,321,Ema,"I panicked, and rushed toward both of them."
Rise from the ashes,6,322,Phoenix,Why would you do something so dangerous!?
Rise from the ashes,6,323,Ema,What else could I have done!? He was about to stab Mr. Marshall!
Rise from the ashes,6,324,Phoenix,(She seems so convinced that Darke was the one holding the knife...)
Rise from the ashes,6,325,Edgeworth,"But as we've just theorized, Mr. Marshall was the one holding the knife."
Rise from the ashes,6,326,Ema,"Well, I didn't know that at the time! When that Darke guy knocked me down, all I could think was, ""I've got to help Mr. Marshall!"""
Rise from the ashes,6,327,Ema,I think I... I knocked away the man with the knife.
Rise from the ashes,6,328,Phoenix,"What do you mean, you ""think""?"
Rise from the ashes,6,329,Ema,It... it all happened so fast... And I was in shock! I don't remember everything clearly. What I did... it's all kind of a blur...
Rise from the ashes,6,330,Edgeworth,"In a matter of just a few seconds Ms. Skye was almost killed, then she witnessed a murder about to take place. A little disorientation is only natural."
Rise from the ashes,6,331,Ema,"I saw the man about to stab the other person, who I thought was Mr. Marshall. I knew I had to stop the man with the knife."
Rise from the ashes,6,332,Judge,"What you did was very brave, young girl. So then, what happened next?"
Rise from the ashes,6,333,Ema,"Just then there was another flash of lightning, and that's when I saw... the Blue Badger!"
Rise from the ashes,6,334,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,335,Phoenix,Are you sure about this?
Rise from the ashes,6,336,Ema,Of course! See? I even drew a picture of him here!
Rise from the ashes,6,337,Edgeworth,But... the Head Detective of Criminal Affairs thought up this hideous beast. And that was just this year... The Blue Badger didn't exist two years ago. This is all quite verifiable.
Rise from the ashes,6,338,Ema,I know it sounds strange. I was surprised too when I saw him at the Police Department. I had this nagging feeling that I'd seen him before somewhere. Now I finally remember!
Rise from the ashes,6,339,Phoenix,"(Oh, brother. Just when you thought that thing had caused enough commotion...)"
Rise from the ashes,6,340,Judge,Tell us... Where in the room did you see him dancing?
Rise from the ashes,6,341,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,342,Phoenix,"The mysterious ""Blue Badger"" was in fact... this!"
Rise from the ashes,6,343,Judge,"But that's... Er, what exactly is that?"
Rise from the ashes,6,344,Phoenix,I believe it's some sort of jar.
Rise from the ashes,6,345,Ema,But Mr. Wright! That doesn't look anything like the Blue Badger!
Rise from the ashes,6,346,Phoenix,"Indeed it doesn't. As it stands now, it's just a plain jar. However... What if we were to change our viewpoint?"
Rise from the ashes,6,347,Judge,Our viewpoint...?
Rise from the ashes,6,348,Phoenix,(I've got to show them the correct angle to look at this from!)
Rise from the ashes,6,349,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,350,Phoenix,Well...? Is this a miracle or what? No one can possibly deny this jar's resemblance to the Blue Badger!
Rise from the ashes,6,351,Edgeworth,No... It can't be!!!
Rise from the ashes,6,352,Judge,"Order! Order! The defense has proven its claim. The mysterious ""Blue Badger"" witnessed on the day of the crime was actually this..."
Rise from the ashes,6,353,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,354,Edgeworth,"Although we all enjoyed Mr. Wright's dramatic performance, one question remains... What's your point!?"
Rise from the ashes,6,355,Phoenix,What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,6,356,Edgeworth,So that Badger thing was actually just a jar. That doesn't change anything!
Rise from the ashes,6,357,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,358,Phoenix,"I'm afraid that's where you're wrong, Mr. Edgeworth. You see... this changes everything!"
Rise from the ashes,6,359,Edgeworth,"Indeed? Very well, then. Please tell us... What's different now that we know the witness saw this jar?"
Rise from the ashes,6,360,Phoenix,"Allow me to take these in turn. At the moment of the murder, the witness saw this jar."
Rise from the ashes,6,361,Edgeworth,"Not only that, but she saw it at a very specific angle."
Rise from the ashes,6,362,Phoenix,"Knowing this, where could she have seen this jar?"
Rise from the ashes,6,363,Judge,Where...?
Rise from the ashes,6,364,Phoenix,The location of the jar is shown in a picture taken on the day of the crime. It's on a shelf in the office of Damon Gant.
Rise from the ashes,6,365,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,366,Edgeworth,But the body was found lying near Lana Skye's desk! The witness testified so herself!
Rise from the ashes,6,367,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,368,Phoenix,"Yes! And it is these two facts that reveal what actually transpired! You see... The struggle between Darke and Marshall did not take place in Lana Skye's office! It happened on the other side of the room, in Chief Gant's office!"
Rise from the ashes,6,369,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,370,Edgeworth,Are you implying the murderer moved the victim's body? From Damon Gant's office to Lana Skye's office?
Rise from the ashes,6,371,Phoenix,Yes.
Rise from the ashes,6,372,Edgeworth,Why would he do that!? There's no reason!
Rise from the ashes,6,373,Phoenix,Exactly.
Rise from the ashes,6,374,Edgeworth,!
Rise from the ashes,6,375,Phoenix,"If there wasn't a ""reason""... he wouldn't have gone through the trouble. The only logical conclusion... is that there was a ""reason."""
Rise from the ashes,6,376,Judge,"Do you know what that reason was, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,6,377,Phoenix,"(I've finally figured it out... So this is why Lana tried to stop the trial! It's too late to quit now, though.) Please recall the witness's testimony. She said she knocked away the man who was holding up the knife. In the next instant, the jar was hit and flew threw the air. Now tell me... What could have sent the jar flying?"
Rise from the ashes,6,378,Judge,That would have to have been... the impact the man made when he was knocked into the wall?
Rise from the ashes,6,379,Phoenix,Ladies and gentlemen... if I may draw your attention to this picture once more. If the man was knocked in the direction of the shelf the jar was sitting on... what would he have hit?
Rise from the ashes,6,380,Ema,A-AHHHHHH...
Rise from the ashes,6,381,Judge,The suit of armor! Holding... a very sharp and dangerous-looking sword...
Rise from the ashes,6,382,Phoenix,"Yes. And since the man who was knocked into the armor was carrying a broken knife... he would have had to have been Neil Marshall, wielding the Prosecutor's Award."
Rise from the ashes,6,383,Edgeworth,No... Mr. Wright... You can't be thinking...
Rise from the ashes,6,384,Phoenix,Yes. There is another possibility of what actually transpired in that room.
Rise from the ashes,6,385,Judge,Another possibility?
Rise from the ashes,6,386,Phoenix,"Of course the perpetrator would have had no idea, but nevertheless! ... (I... I don't know if I can go through with this...)"
Rise from the ashes,6,387,Judge,Mr. Wright? What's the matter?
Rise from the ashes,6,388,Edgeworth,If events took place as the defense theorizes... Then the outcome is obvious. In that moment... assuming the man Ema Skye knocked away was actually Prosecutor Neil Marshall...
Rise from the ashes,6,389,Ema,You mean... Mr. Marshall died... because of... me...? NOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Rise from the ashes,6,390,_,*thud*
Rise from the ashes,6,391,Edgeworth,I never imagined her testimony would lead to this...
Rise from the ashes,6,392,Judge,So it was the witness who took the victim's life... and then proved so with her own testimony! This is unprecedented!
Rise from the ashes,6,393,Lana,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,394,Lana,What... What are you saying!?
Rise from the ashes,6,395,Phoenix,"I'm sorry, Ms. Skye, but given the circumstances..."
Rise from the ashes,6,396,Lana,Joe Darke murdered Prosecutor Marshall! How can you think it was Ema!? How dare you try to pin the crime on her!?
Rise from the ashes,6,397,Edgeworth,"Imagine that, coming from you."
Rise from the ashes,6,398,Lana,!
Rise from the ashes,6,399,Edgeworth,"If you recall, it was you who admitted to forging evidence two years ago. The reason you moved Prosecutor Marshall's body... was to keep anyone else from finding out about what Ema did, wasn't it?"
Rise from the ashes,6,400,Lana,"I assure you, Mr. Edgeworth, I have no idea what you're talking about. If you hope to have anyone believe your insane allegations, I'm afraid you're going to have to have proof. Tell me... Do you have any conclusive evidence that proves my sister killed Neil Marshall?"
Rise from the ashes,6,401,Phoenix,E-evidence?
Rise from the ashes,6,402,Lana,I'm willing to bet you don't.
Rise from the ashes,6,403,Judge,Yes... it certainly would be difficult to prove this with evidence.
Rise from the ashes,6,404,Edgeworth,"If we don't have evidence, then we'll have to rely on testimony."
Rise from the ashes,6,405,Lana,I'm afraid that won't work in this case. Both parties involved in the incident are dead.
Rise from the ashes,6,406,Phoenix,...! (We certainly can't get dead people to testify. This has all been a wild goose chase from the beginning!)
Rise from the ashes,6,407,Edgeworth,"Hmph. Touche, Ms. Skye. Of course... That only leaves us with one possibility."
Rise from the ashes,6,408,Phoenix,"...! (You mean, there's still another possibility?)"
Rise from the ashes,6,409,Judge,"What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?"
Rise from the ashes,6,410,Edgeworth,"I mean, the possibility that the victim left us a message. For better or for worse, Mr. Marshall did not die instantly. He may have left behind the name of the person who took his life... somehow."
Rise from the ashes,6,411,Lana,That's... That's impossible!
Rise from the ashes,6,412,Judge,"Well, Mr. Wright? This is the only possibility left to you. A message from the deceased... Does such a message exist?"
Rise from the ashes,6,413,Phoenix,(I've got to think back to the Court Record!) The real murderer's name that the victim may have left behind...
Rise from the ashes,6,414,Phoenix,"This ""message"" from the deceased... is already in our possession."
Rise from the ashes,6,415,Lana,Mr. Wright! Will you stop at nothing to prove my sister a murderer?
Rise from the ashes,6,416,Edgeworth,"Do not be mistaken, Ms. Skye."
Rise from the ashes,6,417,Lana,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,418,Edgeworth,Our purpose is not to accuse Ema of any crime. There is only one thing we seek: the truth. No matter how painful it may be.
Rise from the ashes,6,419,Judge,"Now then, Mr. Wright. Please show us the piece of evidence... that conveys a message from the deceased!"
Rise from the ashes,6,420,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,421,Phoenix,This is the message left by the deceased.
Rise from the ashes,6,422,Judge,"This is that ""Blue Badger"" from before, right?"
Rise from the ashes,6,423,Lana,"Oh, is he going to just speak the killer's name?"
Rise from the ashes,6,424,Edgeworth,"If that thing could, I'm sure it would."
Rise from the ashes,6,425,Phoenix,(Looks like everyone's forgotten this is just a jar.) A message was left here... on the surface of this jar.
Rise from the ashes,6,426,Judge,What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,6,427,Phoenix,"If you look closely, you can see a faint trail of blood on this jar."
Rise from the ashes,6,428,Edgeworth,It looks like someone wiped the blood away.
Rise from the ashes,6,429,Lana,...
Rise from the ashes,6,430,Phoenix,"Yes, but notice: for some reason... the blood on some of the fragments was not wiped away."
Rise from the ashes,6,431,Judge,Yes... there is a line here... drawn in blood!
Rise from the ashes,6,432,Edgeworth,"So what you're saying, is these ""dots""... were once lines!"
Rise from the ashes,6,433,Phoenix,Prosecutor Marshall did not die instantly. He used the few precious moments left to him to leave behind a message!
Rise from the ashes,6,434,Edgeworth,One that someone apparently wiped away... But blood must have seeped into the jar where the lines change directions.
Rise from the ashes,6,435,Phoenix,Precisely so! All we need to do is connect these points... and the victim's message will become apparent!
Rise from the ashes,6,436,Lana,N-no...!
Rise from the ashes,6,437,Judge,Mr. Wright! What kind of message did the victim leave for us!?
Rise from the ashes,6,438,Phoenix,"Your Honor... I believe these blood stains will reveal to us the answer! (I've got to connect these dots to make letters. There's only one thing the victim would have written, given the circumstances: The murderer's name!)"
Rise from the ashes,6,439,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,440,Phoenix,"(It's a defense attorney's duty to prove his client's innocence. That's why all I've been thinking about is saving Lana. After all my efforts, I never thought it would turn out like this!)"
Rise from the ashes,6,441,Edgeworth,So this is the final message Prosecutor Marshall left behind.
Rise from the ashes,6,442,Judge,"Of all people... She may not have meant it... but in the end, the one who took the victim's life..."
Rise from the ashes,6,443,Phoenix,was Ema Skye.
Rise from the ashes,6,444,Gant,"See, Worthy? Can't say I didn't warn you."
Rise from the ashes,6,445,Edgeworth,Chief Gant...
Rise from the ashes,6,446,Gant,Do you understand the implications of what you've done?
Rise from the ashes,6,447,Edgeworth,What...? What are you talking about?
Rise from the ashes,6,448,Gant,"Two years ago, Joe Darke was sentenced to death. He was convicted because of his final murder. I believe you were the prosecutor in the case, were you not?"
Rise from the ashes,6,449,Edgeworth,Ack!
Rise from the ashes,6,450,Gant,"Yes, Worthy. Because of you... an innocent man was sentenced to death. Not only that... but you used forged evidence to ensure his conviction!"
Rise from the ashes,6,451,Edgeworth,K-kkckck! KKCKRRAAAAHHHH!!!
Rise from the ashes,6,452,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,453,Phoenix,But Joe Darke really was a serial murderer! That's undeniable!
Rise from the ashes,6,454,Gant,I'm afraid that's not important. Didn't you know? We aren't defenders of justice.
Rise from the ashes,6,455,Phoenix,What?
Rise from the ashes,6,456,Gant,We're merely keepers of the law. Sentencing a man to death... is no light matter. Even if there wasn't any cover-up or evidence forgery... ultimately the responsibility falls on the prosecutor in charge.
Rise from the ashes,6,457,Edgeworth,!
Rise from the ashes,6,458,Gant,"Despite what anyone may say, this fact cannot be denied."
Rise from the ashes,6,459,Judge,Order! Order! Order! ORDEEEEERRRRRR!!!
Rise from the ashes,6,460,Phoenix,"The gavel's pounding fell on deaf ears... Unable to settle the crowd, the judge declared a recess. Where this trial is headed, no one knows..."
Rise from the ashes,6,461,Phoenix,"Sorry, Edgeworth. I didn't mean to get you in trouble..."
Rise from the ashes,6,462,Edgeworth,"Hmph. Don't worry about it. This is my problem, not yours."
Rise from the ashes,6,463,Gumshoe,"Hope I'm not interrupting anything, pals."
Rise from the ashes,6,464,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,6,465,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,6,466,Gumshoe,Oh... Guess I am. I'll come back later.
Rise from the ashes,6,467,Phoenix,"Oh, Detective Gumshoe! What is it?"
Rise from the ashes,6,468,Gumshoe,"You've got a lot of nerve, pal! Making a detective run all around while on duty, and to top it off you call me here... I've seen happier people at funerals!"
Rise from the ashes,6,469,Phoenix,I take it Lana's having you run errands again.
Rise from the ashes,6,470,Gumshoe,"Let me tell you, this is the last time, pal! Here. She asked me to give this to you if there was a break in today's trial."
Rise from the ashes,6,471,Phoenix,"""Evidence Law""? (Edgeworth was talking about this just the other day...)"
Rise from the ashes,6,472,Edgeworth,"I'm sure you know the two rules of evidence law, don't you Wright? Rule 1: no evidence shall be shown without the approval of the Police Department!"
Rise from the ashes,6,473,Ema,"I-is that right, Mr. Wright!?"
Rise from the ashes,6,474,Phoenix,It seems so.
Rise from the ashes,6,475,Ema,You could at least study some evidence law! Really!
Rise from the ashes,6,476,Gumshoe,The Chief Prosecutor also wanted me to give you a message.
Rise from the ashes,6,477,Phoenix,A message?
Rise from the ashes,6,478,Gumshoe,"She said, ""If you're planning to take HIM on, you're going to need this book."""
Rise from the ashes,6,479,Phoenix,"(""Him""... I guess I'll need to give this book a thorough read...)"
Rise from the ashes,6,480,Gumshoe,Doesn't look like that book'll do you any good now though. All that's left now is the Chief Prosecutor's sentence.
Rise from the ashes,6,481,Phoenix,"That's where you're wrong, Detective."
Rise from the ashes,6,482,Gumshoe,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,6,483,Edgeworth,Haven't you figured it out yet? Why I'm still sitting in that prosecutor's seat... despite all these allegations being thrown at me?
Rise from the ashes,6,484,Gumshoe,Mr. Edgeworth...
Rise from the ashes,6,485,Edgeworth,The real trial today... hasn't begun yet.
Rise from the ashes,6,486,Gumshoe,"What!? What else is there left to do? Your credibility's been all but ruined with this forged evidence you were unaware of, Ema Skye found out she unwittingly caused a man's death... And now you're telling me you want to do more!? You've gotta be kidding me, pal!"
Rise from the ashes,6,487,Phoenix,"You're missing the point, Detective. Lana didn't murder Detective Goodman."
Rise from the ashes,6,488,Gumshoe,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,489,Phoenix,She merely stuck a knife into his dead body. That means the real killer...is still out there.
Rise from the ashes,6,490,Gumshoe,What!?
Rise from the ashes,6,491,Phoenix,(And we're going to expose him... No matter what it takes! This case has hurt too many people. It's time to bring it to an end!)
Rise from the ashes,6,492,Judge,The court will now reconvene for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye. Mr. Edgeworth.
Rise from the ashes,6,493,Edgeworth,"Yes, Your Honor?"
Rise from the ashes,6,494,Judge,The inquiry committee is planning to impose harsh penalties for your actions.
Rise from the ashes,6,495,Edgeworth,"Thank you for the news, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,6,496,Judge,"Yes, well... *a-hem* Normally, this is where the prosecution calls forth a witness... but, er... *a-hem* *cough* *cough* This isn't easy to say... You see, there is some concern that Mr. Edgeworth may have, ah..."
Rise from the ashes,6,497,Edgeworth,Struck a bargain?
Rise from the ashes,6,498,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,499,Edgeworth,You think I may have manipulated the witnesses.
Rise from the ashes,6,500,Judge,"I didn't say that! It's just, you see... Everyone has been talking, and..."
Rise from the ashes,6,501,Edgeworth,"... Very well, Your Honor. I have a solution."
Rise from the ashes,6,502,Judge,A solution?
Rise from the ashes,6,503,Edgeworth,"That being the case, the prosecution will allow the defense to call forth all further witnesses."
Rise from the ashes,6,504,Judge,What!? But there's never been a case example...
Rise from the ashes,6,505,Edgeworth,"Undeniably this is an unusual arrangement... but a very effective one. It would prove that I haven't struck any ""deals"" with the witnesses."
Rise from the ashes,6,506,Judge,"Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? What do you say?"
Rise from the ashes,6,507,Phoenix,... (Unbelievable. Edgeworth has found a way to continue the trial!) Very well. The defense accepts the prosecution's proposal.
Rise from the ashes,6,508,Judge,"Then it's settled. The, uh... defense... may now call forth the next witness!"
Rise from the ashes,6,509,Edgeworth,Mr. Wright.
Rise from the ashes,6,510,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,511,Edgeworth,You do realize this is your last chance? If you call the wrong witness... this trial is as good as over.
Rise from the ashes,6,512,Phoenix,The defense calls... (The time's finally come to bring out the real murderer!)
Rise from the ashes,6,513,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,514,Phoenix,Damon Gant. The defense calls Damon Gant to the stand!
Rise from the ashes,6,515,Judge,D-Damon Gant...? What does he have to do with anything!?
Rise from the ashes,6,516,Phoenix,"... As the defendant's partner two years ago, Mr. Gant has first-hand knowledge of the crime. I feel we should hear what he has to say about it."
Rise from the ashes,6,517,Judge,Hmm...
Rise from the ashes,6,518,Edgeworth,"As luck would have it, he should still be in the courthouse. He would also be the least likely to have been manipulated by me in any way. Wouldn't you agree, Your Honor?"
Rise from the ashes,6,519,Judge,True... All right. Bailiff! Please escort Mr. Gant to the stand!
Rise from the ashes,6,520,Edgeworth,Witness. Please state your name and occupation.
Rise from the ashes,6,521,Gant,"What is this, some kind of practical joke? I was just on my way to lunch!"
Rise from the ashes,6,522,Edgeworth,"Your name and occupation, sir."
Rise from the ashes,6,523,Gant,Worthy... Are you sure you want to do this?
Rise from the ashes,6,524,Edgeworth,Your name and occupation!
Rise from the ashes,6,525,Gant,"So... You want to play hardball, eh?"
Rise from the ashes,6,526,Judge,"P-please, Mr. Gant."
Rise from the ashes,6,527,Gant,... Fine. My name is Damon Gant. I'm the acting Chief of Police.
Rise from the ashes,6,528,Phoenix,"Now then, Chief Gant. The court requests to hear your testimony."
Rise from the ashes,6,529,Gant,"Oh, Wrighto. What's with the grim face?"
Rise from the ashes,6,530,Phoenix,"First, let's clear up this SL-9 Incident."
Rise from the ashes,6,531,Gant,"Oh, you mean that time when Lana's sister murdered that prosecutor? Personally, I think it's been made pretty clear already."
Rise from the ashes,6,532,Phoenix,There are still some things unaccounted for.
Rise from the ashes,6,533,Gant,Oh? Like what?
Rise from the ashes,6,534,Phoenix,Like the role you played in all of this.
Rise from the ashes,6,535,Gant,... Son... Either you're very brave... or very foolish.
Rise from the ashes,6,536,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,6,537,Gant,You are aware of course that a police chief has all kinds of weapons at his disposal?
Rise from the ashes,6,538,Phoenix,"""Weapons""...?"
Rise from the ashes,6,539,Gant,"Sure. Take my testimony, for example. I don't have to give it if I don't want to."
Rise from the ashes,6,540,Phoenix,What? Is that true?
Rise from the ashes,6,541,Judge,I'm afraid so... The Chief of Police has the right to refuse to testify.
Rise from the ashes,6,542,Edgeworth,"Of course, such an action carries with it certain risks..."
Rise from the ashes,6,543,Gant,"... Don't worry. I'm not here to hinder your trial. Just remember... If this turns out to be a big waste of time, don't say I didn't warn you."
Rise from the ashes,6,544,Judge,Very well. The witness may now begin his testimony.
Rise from the ashes,6,545,Judge,Hmm... Is that when Darke was arrested?
Rise from the ashes,6,546,Gant,Him? He was lying on the floor unconscious. When Ema sent Neil flying... it seems Darke bumped his head.
Rise from the ashes,6,547,Judge,I see... Everything seems pretty clear-cut.
Rise from the ashes,6,548,Phoenix,(If the police chief has the right to refuse to testify... Then I'd better hit him hard and fast!)
Rise from the ashes,6,549,Gant,"As I recall, Neil and I were questioning him that day."
Rise from the ashes,6,550,Phoenix,As I recall... a ceremony was held at the Police Department that day...
Rise from the ashes,6,551,Gant,"Yes, that's right. I guess you could say I'm a workaholic... After winning his award, Neil was all fired up too. That's probably what spooked Darke, and made him run away like that."
Rise from the ashes,6,552,Edgeworth,"Was the defendant, Lana Skye, also present in the room?"
Rise from the ashes,6,553,Gant,"I don't quite remember... At the very least, she wasn't there when Darke ran for it."
Rise from the ashes,6,554,Gant,"To make a long story short, we slipped up. That power outage didn't help either."
Rise from the ashes,6,555,Phoenix,"So the two of you ran immediately after him, right?"
Rise from the ashes,6,556,Gant,"That's right, but Darke made it to the elevator first, so Neil and I split up. He went upstairs and I went downstairs. I guess you could say... he got ""lucky."""
Rise from the ashes,6,557,Edgeworth,What's this about a power outage?
Rise from the ashes,6,558,Gant,"Oh, that. The elevator stopped all of a sudden, and I got the shock of my life. Well... Probably not as shocked as Neil was when that knife went into his heart, though."
Rise from the ashes,6,559,Phoenix,(That's not funny...)
Rise from the ashes,6,560,Gant,"When I went to my office, I found Lana there."
Rise from the ashes,6,561,Phoenix,Could you tell us what you saw?
Rise from the ashes,6,562,Gant,"It was a shocking sight... Neil and that serial killer were lying in a heap on the floor, all tangled together."
Rise from the ashes,6,563,Phoenix,Darke was also lying collapsed on the floor?
Rise from the ashes,6,564,Gant,"Yes, apparently he hit his head and was knocked out. Next to them were those two poor girls."
Rise from the ashes,6,565,Phoenix,(Lana and Ema...)
Rise from the ashes,6,566,Gant,Lana was cradling Ema in her arms. Looking back at it now... She must have already known what her sister had done.
Rise from the ashes,6,567,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,568,Gant,"Apparently she had already... ""arranged"" the crime scene."
Rise from the ashes,6,569,Phoenix,How can you know that!?
Rise from the ashes,6,570,Gant,Because of the victim's body. It had already been moved.
Rise from the ashes,6,571,Edgeworth,So that means... You found the body near Lana's desk?
Rise from the ashes,6,572,Gant,"That's right. I think you said earlier, it was my suit of armor... that really stabbed the prosecutor?"
Rise from the ashes,6,573,Phoenix,Yes...
Rise from the ashes,6,574,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,6,575,Gant,Anyway...
Rise from the ashes,6,576,Gant,"As you can see, I had nothing to do with the ""forgery."""
Rise from the ashes,6,577,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,578,Phoenix,So you're saying... that the forgery had already taken place by the time you arrived at your office?
Rise from the ashes,6,579,Gant,"That's exactly what I'm saying. I can understand how Lana must have felt, but moving a body and hiding evidence are inexcusable no matter what the circumstances."
Rise from the ashes,6,580,Phoenix,(Is that how it really went down?)
Rise from the ashes,6,581,Edgeworth,"Staring at the witness won't do you any good, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,6,582,Phoenix,!
Rise from the ashes,6,583,Edgeworth,If you're going to stare at anything... you'd be better off staring at the Court Record.
Rise from the ashes,6,584,Gant,"Worthy, Worthy... Always the smooth talker."
Rise from the ashes,6,585,Phoenix,(But which piece of evidence ties Gant to the forgery...?)
Rise from the ashes,6,586,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,587,Phoenix,You claim you had nothing to do with the forgery... but I'm afraid that is a claim you cannot back up.
Rise from the ashes,6,588,Gant,Explain yourself.
Rise from the ashes,6,589,Phoenix,"Several pieces of evidence were found in your office. Take this jar, for example."
Rise from the ashes,6,590,Judge,That's the Blue Badger you showed us earlier.
Rise from the ashes,6,591,Phoenix,A piece of this jar was discovered in your safe.
Rise from the ashes,6,592,Gant,...
Rise from the ashes,6,593,Phoenix,"Not only that, but the evidence list I presented earlier... was actually found inside your desk!"
Rise from the ashes,6,594,Judge,It was found where!?
Rise from the ashes,6,595,Phoenix,"You see, Chief Gant. These articles of evidence uncovered in your office... are both concrete proof... that you also played a part in the illegal investigation!"
Rise from the ashes,6,596,Judge,Chief Gant! What's the meaning of this!?
Rise from the ashes,6,597,Gant,Ho! Here's a defense attorney who may even rival Worthy!
Rise from the ashes,6,598,Phoenix,"So you admit to it, then? That you were involved in the forgery?"
Rise from the ashes,6,599,Gant,"Who, me? Or do you mean... you?"
Rise from the ashes,6,600,Phoenix,Me? Why would I have anything to do with that!?
Rise from the ashes,6,601,Gant,"Well... You were the one who snuck into my office when you ""found"" this evidence."
Rise from the ashes,6,602,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,603,Gant,"Prosecutors aren't the only ones capable of forging evidence, you know. Defense attorneys can do so too. Isn't that right, Wrighto?"
Rise from the ashes,6,604,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,605,Edgeworth,However! Detective Gumshoe was present during the investigation!
Rise from the ashes,6,606,Gant,"Worthy, my boy. Not even detectives are exempt from the law. Rest assured Dick will receive his due punishment."
Rise from the ashes,6,607,Edgeworth,Wh...
Rise from the ashes,6,608,Phoenix,"WHAAAAT!? (If Detective Gumshoe's salary drops any further, he'll end up paying to work!)"
Rise from the ashes,6,609,Judge,"Yes, well. In light of the Detective's presence... please give us your testimony regarding these pieces of evidence found in your office, and their relation to the forgery that took place at the crime scene."
Rise from the ashes,6,610,Gant,"My, my... Kids these days no longer know how to put two and two together..."
Rise from the ashes,6,611,Judge,Hmm... Mr. Wright.
Rise from the ashes,6,612,Phoenix,"Yes, Your Honor?"
Rise from the ashes,6,613,Judge,When investigating the crime scene... you should have been more careful to observe protocol.
Rise from the ashes,6,614,Gant,"You do understand that I am the Chief of Police, right? There will be consequences..."
Rise from the ashes,6,615,Phoenix,Ooh...
Rise from the ashes,6,616,Gant,"Indeed, I believe I will press charges... so you won't make the same mistake again."
Rise from the ashes,6,617,Judge,"My apologies, Chief, but would you mind waiting until tomorrow for that? Today is... well, you know..."
Rise from the ashes,6,618,Gant,"All right, Udgey. In return, though..."
Rise from the ashes,6,619,Judge,"I know! I know! That place, right?"
Rise from the ashes,6,620,Phoenix,"(Huh? What are these guys, telepathic?)"
Rise from the ashes,6,621,Gant,"For all I know, you could have planted them in my office."
Rise from the ashes,6,622,Phoenix,I'd appreciate it if you'd stop making these ridiculous allegations.
Rise from the ashes,6,623,Gant,"Yes, you do have a point... You wouldn't have the guts to do something like that..."
Rise from the ashes,6,624,Phoenix,"What!? I'll have you know, back in the day I once broke into a cattle ranch, and tipped-"
Rise from the ashes,6,625,Judge,M-Mr. Wright! What are you saying!?
Rise from the ashes,6,626,Gant,"Anyway, you can't prove you didn't carry in the evidence, can you? If you have proof to the contrary, you're going to need it later."
Rise from the ashes,6,627,Edgeworth,Later? What are you talking about?
Rise from the ashes,6,628,Gant,"What else? I'm talking about when your fingerprints are found. Yes. If they're found inside my safe, they would prove your investigation was illegal."
Rise from the ashes,6,629,Phoenix,Grrr... (I've never faced anyone as slimy as this guy!)
Rise from the ashes,6,630,Gant,"Anyway, you can't prove ""when"" those pieces of evidence were discovered."
Rise from the ashes,6,631,Phoenix,What do you mean by that?
Rise from the ashes,6,632,Gant,"This is all purely hypothetical, of course... but suppose I did place those items in my safe. Such an act... wouldn't necessarily constitute forgery."
Rise from the ashes,6,633,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,634,Phoenix,If concealing evidence found at a crime scene isn't forgery...
Rise from the ashes,6,635,Gant,"I'm not through speaking yet, Mr. Wright. It all depends on ""when"" the evidence was discovered."
Rise from the ashes,6,636,Gant,"If they were found after Darke was convicted, then they're worthless."
Rise from the ashes,6,637,Phoenix,Are you saying this jar fragment... wasn't discovered in the initial investigation?
Rise from the ashes,6,638,Gant,"It would appear not. After all, it wasn't listed in the evidence list. For all we know, it could have suddenly materialized the day after Darke was sentenced."
Rise from the ashes,6,639,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,640,Phoenix,"Oh, and wouldn't that be convenient..."
Rise from the ashes,6,641,Edgeworth,Wright.
Rise from the ashes,6,642,Phoenix,!
Rise from the ashes,6,643,Edgeworth,"The Chief is talking about a ""possibility."" So long as you can't rule that out... your remarks, however clever they may be, will only succeed in wasting time."
Rise from the ashes,6,644,Phoenix,(Tell me something I don't know...)
Rise from the ashes,6,645,Gant,"Come now, Mr. Wright. Think about it."
Rise from the ashes,6,646,Gant,There's no reason I'd participate in a forgery.
Rise from the ashes,6,647,Phoenix,How can you look me in the eye and say that!?
Rise from the ashes,6,648,Gant,Because I'm innocent.
Rise from the ashes,6,649,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,650,Gant,Remember? Who was it that murdered Neil?
Rise from the ashes,6,651,Judge,"I'm not sure I care for the word ""murder"" here... but in the end the person responsible for Mr. Marshall's unfortunate demise... was Ema Skye."
Rise from the ashes,6,652,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,6,653,Gant,Well? Now do you see?
Rise from the ashes,6,654,Gant,Rearranging the crime scene wouldn't help me out in any way.
Rise from the ashes,6,655,Phoenix,"Really, Chief Gant? At the very least, there is one very large benefit you've reaped from all this."
Rise from the ashes,6,656,Gant,"Oh? I wasn't aware. What is this ""benefit""?"
Rise from the ashes,6,657,Phoenix,That would of course be the position you have- Chief of Police.
Rise from the ashes,6,658,Judge,Oh...
Rise from the ashes,6,659,Phoenix,The resolution of the SL-9 Incident secured your promotion to Chief. That in itself is sufficient motive!
Rise from the ashes,6,660,Gant,"... Ho! Ho! Ho! Oh, that's a good one!"
Rise from the ashes,6,661,Phoenix,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,6,662,Gant,Do you really think I'm that incompetent?
Rise from the ashes,6,663,Phoenix,What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,6,664,Gant,"Even without that case, I was already in line to become the next chief. The resolution of SL-9 merely sped up the inevitable a little."
Rise from the ashes,6,665,Phoenix,"Is that true, Edgeworth?"
Rise from the ashes,6,666,Edgeworth,Yes... He was going to be made Chief anyway.
Rise from the ashes,6,667,Phoenix,Gah!
Rise from the ashes,6,668,Gant,Be careful when pointing that finger... or you might wind up being the one pointed at!
Rise from the ashes,6,669,Edgeworth,So that means... there's only one possible motivation for you to commit forgery. If you didn't do it for yourself... then you did it for someone else.
Rise from the ashes,6,670,Gant,"Don't be silly, Worthy. You know me better than that. There are only three people I look out for: Me, Myself and I. ... There, it's out in the open now. Udgey, would you mind if I changed my testimony a little?"
Rise from the ashes,6,671,Judge,"By all means, please do!"
Rise from the ashes,6,672,Gant,"I wouldn't be anyone's ""accomplice"" if there was nothing in it for me."
Rise from the ashes,6,673,Phoenix,"""Nothing in it"" for you?"
Rise from the ashes,6,674,Gant,"Sorry, but the only person I care about is Yours Truly. That girl... Lana's little sister, was it? If you think I felt sorry for her, you'd better think again."
Rise from the ashes,6,675,Edgeworth,You're right... You don't feel sorry for anyone.
Rise from the ashes,6,676,Gant,Be tough on crime and tough on people. That's how I was raised.
Rise from the ashes,6,677,Edgeworth,"You seem to be lax enough on yourself, though."
Rise from the ashes,6,678,Gant,"Ho! Ho! Ho! Oh, that's a good one, Worthy!"
Rise from the ashes,6,679,Phoenix,"(Hmm... Could there have been something in it for him? Given his selfishness, would he have helped someone out?)"
Rise from the ashes,6,680,Phoenix,"True, you might not help out anyone for their sake. But if it would benefit you... you might decide to assist someone."
Rise from the ashes,6,681,Gant,...
Rise from the ashes,6,682,Judge,Mr. Wright. It appears you're positively determined to portray the Chief... as a nice man who likes to lend people a hand.
Rise from the ashes,6,683,Phoenix,(That's not what I mean...)
Rise from the ashes,6,684,Judge,"Very well, I'll ask. Who is this person you believe Chief Gant may have helped forge evidence?"
Rise from the ashes,6,685,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,686,Judge,Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye... Th-the defendant!?
Rise from the ashes,6,687,Gant,...
Rise from the ashes,6,688,Phoenix,"I believe it's quite obvious in light of the circumstances. Ema Skye fell victim to an unfortunate series of events. Who would want to help her more than her own sister, Lana? And as for Chief Gant... he would also have a reason to help Lana if she asked him to. That reason, of course, is... self profit."
Rise from the ashes,6,689,Judge,Self profit...? What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,6,690,Phoenix,"After the SL-9 Incident was resolved... Lana Skye was appointed Chief Prosecutor at the Prosecutor's Office. The person who arranged this job change...was you, Chief Gant."
Rise from the ashes,6,691,Gant,...
Rise from the ashes,6,692,Judge,B-but... how would he profit from all of this?
Rise from the ashes,6,693,Edgeworth,He would be able to use the Chief Prosecutor as his puppet! Essentially... he would acquire unchecked authority over all investigations!
Rise from the ashes,6,694,Judge,"Do you mean to tell me... that despite the Chief's formidable appearance, he plays with puppets!? Oh, wait. You must mean ""puppet"" as in someone forced to do his bidding... Never mind!"
Rise from the ashes,6,695,Phoenix,"Admit it, Chief! You assisted Lana Skye in forging evidence! Your motive: to appoint her as Chief Prosecutor so you could control her!"
Rise from the ashes,6,696,Gant,"Wrighto, my boy. You have quite an imagination. Let me ask you something."
Rise from the ashes,6,697,Phoenix,What?
Rise from the ashes,6,698,Gant,"Do you have any proof of this? That I ""controlled"" Lana? For example, is Lana testifying that I've done such a thing?"
Rise from the ashes,6,699,Phoenix,Lana... (She's keeping quiet to protect Ema. There's no way she'd testify against Gant!)
Rise from the ashes,6,700,Judge,"I'm afraid without any proof, this all amounts to nothing more than mere conjecture."
Rise from the ashes,6,701,Edgeworth,... Unless... that is also what happened in this incident...
Rise from the ashes,6,702,Judge,"""This"" incident...? Er... which one would that be?"
Rise from the ashes,6,703,Edgeworth,"Of course I'm talking about... the murder of Detective Bruce Goodman. The Chief Prosecutor has been acting strange throughout this entire trial. Almost as if... someone has been ""controlling"" her!"
Rise from the ashes,6,704,Gant,Worthy... You'd better watch your tongue... I wouldn't want you to get hurt.
Rise from the ashes,6,705,Judge,Just what do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,6,706,Phoenix,"What he means, Your Honor, is that Chief Gant is involved in the murder of Detective Goodman. Not only that... but the Chief is now making Lana take the rap to cover up his involvement!"
Rise from the ashes,6,707,Judge,Wha... wha... wha... WWWHHHHAAAAAAAAATTTTT!!!? Order! Order! Order! I SAID... ORDEEEEERRRR!!! Mr. Wright! You... You can't be serious!
Rise from the ashes,6,708,Phoenix,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,6,709,Judge,This... This is an affront to the highest ranking officer in our law enforcement agency! To accuse the Chief of Police of blackmail... and murder!!!? That's i.... i... i-i-i-i-i-i-i-IMPOSSIBLE!!!
Rise from the ashes,6,710,Phoenix,"... Your Honor, I was merely reiterating... what Mr. Edgeworth said, in easier-to-understand language."
Rise from the ashes,6,711,Edgeworth,"It's too late, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,6,712,Phoenix,!
Rise from the ashes,6,713,Edgeworth,There's no turning back for us now.
Rise from the ashes,6,714,Phoenix,(It looks like he's the one who's decided to go through with this.)
Rise from the ashes,6,715,Judge,"Can you prove this, Mr. Wright? That the Chief, a high-ranking officer of the law, is involved in this murder!?"
Rise from the ashes,6,716,Phoenix,... (Good question...)
Rise from the ashes,6,717,Edgeworth,"Regardless of his rank or title, Chief Gant is just a man. The question is, is he a criminal? I believe the evidence will tell."
Rise from the ashes,6,718,Judge,"I see. Alright, then. Show us the evidence that ties Chief Gant to the murder of Detective Goodman. Just remember... It better be good!"
Rise from the ashes,6,719,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,720,Judge,This is the ID card list...
Rise from the ashes,6,721,Phoenix,"Yes, the one that shows who entered the evidence room on the day of the crime. There was one ID on the list we couldn't determine the owner of yesterday... 7777777."
Rise from the ashes,6,722,Gant,"Sorry, but there's no way you can prove that's my card number."
Rise from the ashes,6,723,Phoenix,It's your number.
Rise from the ashes,6,724,Gant,!
Rise from the ashes,6,725,Judge,What!? How do you know that!?
Rise from the ashes,6,726,Phoenix,The safe in Chief Gant's Office requires a code to open. A seven-digit code...
Rise from the ashes,6,727,Judge,Seven digits... You don't mean...
Rise from the ashes,6,728,Phoenix,"I'm afraid so, Your Honor. The code was ""7777777""... The same as the remaining ID card number on that list! Chief Gant! You entered the evidence room on the day of the crime!"
Rise from the ashes,6,729,Judge,Order! Order! Chief Gant! What do you have to say!?
Rise from the ashes,6,730,Gant,... Nothing. The defense's search of my office was in violation of regulations.
Rise from the ashes,6,731,Edgeworth,"And I will demand Mr. Wright be punished to the maximum extent of the law. But right now, this court demands an explanation from you... about the use of this ID card!"
Rise from the ashes,6,732,Gant,...
Rise from the ashes,6,733,Judge,Chief Gant! So you admit it? You entered the evidence room... on the day of the crime!?
Rise from the ashes,6,734,Gant,"... What about it? I'm Chief of Police. Whether it's the evidence room or the bathroom, what's the difference? I can go anywhere I want."
Rise from the ashes,6,735,Edgeworth,Tell me. When you entered the room... were you alone?
Rise from the ashes,6,736,Gant,I always go to the bathroom alone... as I do with the evidence room.
Rise from the ashes,6,737,Phoenix,Detective Goodman wouldn't have happened to be with you that day... would he?
Rise from the ashes,6,738,Gant,O-of course not! Why would he be? I hadn't seen him in days!
Rise from the ashes,6,739,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,740,Phoenix,"You hadn't seen him... ""in days""? Chief Gant... I'm afraid you've just undone yourself. On that day, you had to have met with Detective Goodman!"
Rise from the ashes,6,741,Judge,What do you mean!? This trial's purpose is to determine Lana Skye's guilt!
Rise from the ashes,6,742,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,743,Edgeworth,"No it isn't, Your Honor. This trial's purpose is to determine the truth. If Chief Gant met the victim on the day of the crime, then we need to determine one thing: what transpired during that meeting!"
Rise from the ashes,6,744,Judge,"In that case, Mr. Wright! I'm going to have to ask you for evidence! Show us proof that the victim went to meet Chief Gant on the day of the crime!"
Rise from the ashes,6,745,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,746,Phoenix,Detective Goodman lost his ID card on the day of the crime.
Rise from the ashes,6,747,Edgeworth,"Or to be more accurate, Jake Marshall stole it."
Rise from the ashes,6,748,Phoenix,So Detective Goodman filled out a lost item report. He would have had to give that report... to the Chief of Police!
Rise from the ashes,6,749,Gant,Yet you are in possession of the report... which means you can't be sure if he filed it.
Rise from the ashes,6,750,Phoenix,"He filed it. How do I know, you ask? Because he needed to enter the evidence room that day."
Rise from the ashes,6,751,Judge,He needed to?
Rise from the ashes,6,752,Phoenix,Yes. To transfer the evidence out.
Rise from the ashes,6,753,Judge,Oh...
Rise from the ashes,6,754,Phoenix,"Detective Goodman took the form to you, Chief Gant. Then... you accompanied the detective to the evidence room!"
Rise from the ashes,6,755,Gant,"I ""accompanied"" him?"
Rise from the ashes,6,756,Phoenix,There's no other way the murderer and Detective Goodman could have entered the room!
Rise from the ashes,6,757,Gant,"Hold on. Let me guess what you're going to say next. I, the Chief of Police, murdered poor Goodman!"
Rise from the ashes,6,758,Phoenix,... Exactly.
Rise from the ashes,6,759,Judge,But wait! The Chief didn't necessarily need to accompany him to the evidence room. He could have just lent him his ID card.
Rise from the ashes,6,760,Gant,"Yes... Now that you mention it, I believe I might have done something of the sort."
Rise from the ashes,6,761,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,762,Edgeworth,"Sorry, but that's not possible."
Rise from the ashes,6,763,Gant,!
Rise from the ashes,6,764,Edgeworth,"According to the record, your card was only used once. But you showed us your ID card earlier. If you had really ""lent"" it to Detective Goodman, it would have been found on his body!"
Rise from the ashes,6,765,Gant,N... NNNNNOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Rise from the ashes,6,766,Judge,Chief Gant! Y-you didn't...!
Rise from the ashes,6,767,Gant,...
Rise from the ashes,6,768,Phoenix,"The murder was most likely committed on the spur of the moment. No one in their right mind would choose the Police Department as a place to commit murder. After the murder, you contacted Lana at the Prosecutor's Office. Why else? To dispose of Detective Goodman's body."
Rise from the ashes,6,769,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,770,Edgeworth,"However, the victim's body was discovered in the Prosecutor's Office's parking lot. How did he manage to move it there?"
Rise from the ashes,6,771,Gant,"I was at the Police Department the entire day, you know."
Rise from the ashes,6,772,Edgeworth,And everyone's aware that Lana stayed at the Prosecutor's Office after the ceremony.
Rise from the ashes,6,773,Phoenix,"Everyone except me, it seems... Still, you're the Chief of Police. You have an entire police force at your disposal."
Rise from the ashes,6,774,Gant,"Oh, so you think I just ordered an officer to do it? ""Hey you. Take this here dead body over to the Prosecutor's Office."" I don't think so..."
Rise from the ashes,6,775,Phoenix,Chief Gant. You left all the evidence we need... to prove how you moved the body to the Prosecutor's Office. (And all this time I thought it was a useless clue just taking up space...)
Rise from the ashes,6,776,Judge,How could the Chief have moved the body!? Mr. Wright! Show us this evidence!
Rise from the ashes,6,777,Phoenix,To move the victim's body... Chief Gant used this!
Rise from the ashes,6,778,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,779,Phoenix,This is how he moved Detective Goodman's body!
Rise from the ashes,6,780,Judge,"A parking stub? ""Miles Edgeworth""..."
Rise from the ashes,6,781,Edgeworth,You mean...!
Rise from the ashes,6,782,Phoenix,The body was found in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car. I think it's obvious what happened. The body was moved by that car!
Rise from the ashes,6,783,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,784,Edgeworth,You mean I... I... I carried the victim's body!?
Rise from the ashes,6,785,Phoenix,Precisely so.
Rise from the ashes,6,786,Edgeworth,But wait! Even you know... I didn't plan on returning to my office... after the ceremony finished that day.
Rise from the ashes,6,787,Phoenix,"But you did return! Tell me, why?"
Rise from the ashes,6,788,Edgeworth,... A-AAAHHHH...!
Rise from the ashes,6,789,Edgeworth,"I... was asked to go. By Chief Gant no less. He told me he wanted me to keep a screwdriver at the Prosecutor's Office. In any case, on the day of the incident, I brought this to the Prosecutor's Office."
Rise from the ashes,6,790,Phoenix,So you see... what you really took to the Prosecutor's Office wasn't the screwdriver... but the victim's body in your trunk!
Rise from the ashes,6,791,Judge,Detective Goodman's body... was carried in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car!
Rise from the ashes,6,792,Phoenix,"Yes. Unless, of course, you have another explanation, Chief? Why else would you have asked Mr. Edgeworth to carry evidence from a closed case?"
Rise from the ashes,6,793,Gant,...
Rise from the ashes,6,794,Phoenix,There's only one plausible explanation: to transport the body to your accomplice... Ms. Lana Skye!
Rise from the ashes,6,795,Judge,Order! Order! Order! What's going on here!? Is there no room for rebuttal to the defense's outrageous accusations!?
Rise from the ashes,6,796,Phoenix,Think back to the photograph Ms. Starr took at the Prosecutor's Office. This was not a photo of the body being stuffed in the trunk to be taken away. It was exactly the opposite...
Rise from the ashes,6,797,Edgeworth,It is a photo of the body being taken from the trunk!
Rise from the ashes,6,798,Judge,"Chief Gant! Please, say something!"
Rise from the ashes,6,799,Gant,I believe... your time's up.
Rise from the ashes,6,800,Judge,"My ""time's up""?"
Rise from the ashes,6,801,Gant,"Sorry, Wrighto, but I'm having lunch with the District Attorney General after this. We have to get going if we're going to make it in time for the early bird special."
Rise from the ashes,6,802,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,803,Phoenix,B-but... The cross-examination isn't finished yet!
Rise from the ashes,6,804,Gant,Remember what I told you earlier? A police chief... has all kinds of weapons at his disposal.
Rise from the ashes,6,805,Phoenix,"...""Weapons""...?"
Rise from the ashes,6,806,Gant,Like the right to refuse to testify. I'm invoking that right now.
Rise from the ashes,6,807,Judge,What!? That is not a right to be casually invoked. There are certain risks to be considered!
Rise from the ashes,6,808,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,809,Edgeworth,So you're going to just run away after all this!?
Rise from the ashes,6,810,Gant,"""Run away""? Don't make me laugh, Worthy."
Rise from the ashes,6,811,Edgeworth,!
Rise from the ashes,6,812,Gant,"""I stabbed ol' Goodman."" That's what you're saying, right? But if you had any conclusive evidence, you would have presented it by now."
Rise from the ashes,6,813,Phoenix,Well I...
Rise from the ashes,6,814,Gant,"You think I had Lana dispose of the body? If so, then show your proof and get it over with!"
Rise from the ashes,6,815,Judge,"Hmm... I'll say it again, Mr. Wright. Damon Gant is the current Chief of Police. This court will not tolerate any accusations against him without concrete proof. Well, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,6,816,Phoenix,Y-Your Honor?
Rise from the ashes,6,817,Judge,Do you have any concrete proof? Proof that Chief Gant murdered Detective Goodman and made Ms. Skye dispose of his body?
Rise from the ashes,6,818,Phoenix,"(Do I have any concrete ""proof""...?)"
Rise from the ashes,6,819,Phoenix,"(It's no use showing evidence I'm not even sure of myself...) No, Your Honor. At present I have no conclusive evidence."
Rise from the ashes,6,820,Gant,"Hmph! See, Udgey?"
Rise from the ashes,6,821,Judge,In that case... This court is forced to penalize you for your allegations against the Chief.
Rise from the ashes,6,822,Phoenix,What?
Rise from the ashes,6,823,Gant,"I don't gamble unless the stakes are high! It seems that Lady Luck was on my side again today. Okay Udgey, I'll leave the rest to you!"
Rise from the ashes,6,824,Judge,"I warned you earlier, Mr. Wright. This...is an affront to a senior officer in our nation's law law enforcement agency."
Rise from the ashes,6,825,Phoenix,... WAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
Rise from the ashes,6,826,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,827,Edgeworth,"""Lady Luck,"" hm? Maybe we should have a word with her."
Rise from the ashes,6,828,Judge,Mr. Edgeworth? What do you mean!?
Rise from the ashes,6,829,Edgeworth,"There's one ""Lady"" who knows the real truth behind this trial... We haven't yet had the honor of hearing her testimony."
Rise from the ashes,6,830,Phoenix,(A lady who knows the truth... Another witness!)
Rise from the ashes,6,831,Edgeworth,"In the absence of conclusive evidence, the only other method of proof is testimony."
Rise from the ashes,6,832,Phoenix,But Chief Gant has invoked his right to refuse to testify!
Rise from the ashes,6,833,Edgeworth,There's still someone else. One more witness who can answer all the questions raised in this trial. Someone right in this very room!
Rise from the ashes,6,834,Judge,Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this person!?
Rise from the ashes,6,835,Edgeworth,"Hmph... Why are you asking me, Your Honor? Have you forgotten? The defense is the one calling witnesses today."
Rise from the ashes,6,836,Judge,Mr. Wright. Does such a witness exist?
Rise from the ashes,6,837,Phoenix,"(She may not be willing to tell the truth... But we can't just stop now!) Yes, Your Honor! The defense calls forth..."
Rise from the ashes,6,838,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,839,Judge,The defendant... Ms. Lana Skye!?
Rise from the ashes,6,840,Phoenix,She was in the underground parking lot at 5:15 PM on February 21. Her task: to dispose of the victim's body... in accordance with a certain someone's orders!
Rise from the ashes,6,841,Judge,Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth...?
Rise from the ashes,6,842,Edgeworth,"The prosecution has no objections, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,6,843,Judge,"Very well. The court will now take its final recess for the day. In 15 minutes, we will reconvene to hear the defendant's testimony. This court is now in re-"
Rise from the ashes,6,844,Gant,Hold on!
Rise from the ashes,6,845,Judge,Huh? Chief Gant! I thought you were going to eat.
Rise from the ashes,6,846,Gant,"Listen good, Lana!"
Rise from the ashes,6,847,Phoenix,(He's talking to Lana!)
Rise from the ashes,6,848,Gant,"I don't think you need me to tell you this, but if you accept Mr. Wright's claim... there will be terrible consequences."
Rise from the ashes,6,849,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,850,Gant,That's right... Your sister will be found guilty... for Neil Marshall's murder!
Rise from the ashes,6,851,Phoenix,Ah! (This isn't good!)
Rise from the ashes,6,852,Gant,"Of course, you'd never support such outrageous claims anyway... right? Just something to think about... All right, then. I've got a lunch date to meet."
Rise from the ashes,6,853,Judge,... Okay. If there aren't any further objections... this court is now in recess!
Rise from the ashes,6,854,Edgeworth,Looks like we managed to stay in the game.
Rise from the ashes,6,855,Phoenix,"Yeah. Thanks to your help, Edgeworth."
Rise from the ashes,6,856,Gumshoe,"That Chief... He's something else, eh pals?"
Rise from the ashes,6,857,Phoenix,Detective Gumshoe!
Rise from the ashes,6,858,Gumshoe,"Ha ha ha. I'm not a ""detective"" anymore."
Rise from the ashes,6,859,Phoenix,Oh yeah. Sorry about that...
Rise from the ashes,6,860,Gumshoe,"Ah, don't worry. I've already decided where to work now! At your office!"
Rise from the ashes,6,861,Phoenix,My office...?
Rise from the ashes,6,862,Gumshoe,Sure! I'll take the place of that top-knotted girl you used to work with!
Rise from the ashes,6,863,Phoenix,(Could he mean... Maya?)
Rise from the ashes,6,864,Gumshoe,Still... Looks like we're all out of moves now. Chief Gant's done it again. How is it he always gets the upper hand!?
Rise from the ashes,6,865,Phoenix,It's not fair he has the right to refuse to testify!
Rise from the ashes,6,866,Edgeworth,"Hmph. Settle down, Wright. Remember what the judge said?"
Rise from the ashes,6,867,Judge,But Chief! That is not a right to be casually invoked. There are certain risks to be considered!
Rise from the ashes,6,868,Phoenix,"""Risks""... What did he mean by that?"
Rise from the ashes,6,869,Edgeworth,It's simple. If the Chief refuses to testify... the opposite also holds true.
Rise from the ashes,6,870,Ema,"You mean, he forfeits his right to say anything too!"
Rise from the ashes,6,871,Phoenix,Ema! Are you okay?
Rise from the ashes,6,872,Ema,"Yeah. When I came to, I was in the medical office. I've been listening to the trial from the gallery."
Rise from the ashes,6,873,Phoenix,"(So she heard everything that's been going on.) Um, Ema... I'm sorry for what I said before."
Rise from the ashes,6,874,Ema,"No, don't be. It was the truth. You know, it's funny. I almost feel somehow... relieved."
Rise from the ashes,6,875,Phoenix,"""Relieved""?"
Rise from the ashes,6,876,Ema,Yeah... Now I finally know what really happened. To think that all this time... my sister was being blackmailed by that terrible man! And she did it all... just to protect me.
Rise from the ashes,6,877,Edgeworth,"Ever since her appointment as Chief Prosecutor, everyone who knew her... said she changed. Perhaps... it was easier that way for her."
Rise from the ashes,6,878,Gumshoe,What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,6,879,Edgeworth,What do you think I mean? To follow Chief Gant's orders. She must have shut herself up deep inside... to force herself to do anything and everything the Chief told her to do.
Rise from the ashes,6,880,Phoenix,(That must be why she became so cold...)
Rise from the ashes,6,881,Ema,It was all my fault. It's all because I... I murdered Mr. Marshall.
Rise from the ashes,6,882,Gumshoe,"Hey. Don't go blaming yourself, now. If you want to blame anyone, blame society, pal!"
Rise from the ashes,6,883,Ema,"Chief Gant may be able to fool everyone else with his ""forgery,"" but he can't fool my memory. I remember now. I knocked Mr. Marshall into that armor."
Rise from the ashes,6,884,Phoenix,I... I see.
Rise from the ashes,6,885,Gumshoe,"Well, we'd better get back. It's time for the final act!"
Rise from the ashes,6,886,Phoenix,"Ema, why don't you wait h-"
Rise from the ashes,6,887,Ema,No. I'm going with you.
Rise from the ashes,6,888,Phoenix,!
Rise from the ashes,6,889,Ema,I want to be there... when Lana tells the truth.
Rise from the ashes,6,890,Edgeworth,"Let's go, Wright. It's time to end this."
Rise from the ashes,6,891,Judge,"Now then... Will the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye, please take the stand?"
Rise from the ashes,6,892,Edgeworth,Ms. Lana Skye. You are the Chief Prosecutor. I'm sure you're aware of what is required of you.
Rise from the ashes,6,893,Lana,But Mr. Edgeworth... you already know everything... You know all that I've done these past two years.
Rise from the ashes,6,894,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,6,895,Judge,"Please provide the court with your testimony, Ms. Skye. And remember... you are under oath. We want to hear the truth."
Rise from the ashes,6,896,Lana,Of course... The truth...
Rise from the ashes,6,897,Ema,"Lana! No matter what happens, I'll always be your sister!"
Rise from the ashes,6,898,Lana,...
Rise from the ashes,6,899,Judge,"Now then, your testimony, if you will. First, tell us about your relationship with Gant."
Rise from the ashes,6,900,Phoenix,(Everything hinges on your testimony. You're the only chance we have to get Gant!)
Rise from the ashes,6,901,Judge,Hmm... Are you sure about this testimony?
Rise from the ashes,6,902,Lana,Your Honor. I'm confessing to a capital offense. Of course I'm sure.
Rise from the ashes,6,903,Ema,But Lana...!
Rise from the ashes,6,904,Judge,"If this is true, then that means Chief Gant has nothing to do with this."
Rise from the ashes,6,905,Lana,That's what I've been telling you from the beginning.
Rise from the ashes,6,906,Ema,"Please, Mr. Wright. You've got to help her! She's sacrificing herself because of me..."
Rise from the ashes,6,907,Phoenix,(But what if she's telling the truth?)
Rise from the ashes,6,908,Ema,"She's not. I know my own sister. Whenever she speaks stiffly like that, she's hiding something inside. Deep down, she's really screaming in agony!"
Rise from the ashes,6,909,Phoenix,...! (Yeah... This is no time to to start second-guessing myself!)
Rise from the ashes,6,910,Judge,The defense may now begin its cross-examination.
Rise from the ashes,6,911,Lana,I worked alongside Gant for years...
Rise from the ashes,6,912,Phoenix,"How many years, exactly?"
Rise from the ashes,6,913,Lana,"Ever since I made senior detective. Let's see, I was 24 then... so that would be five years."
Rise from the ashes,6,914,Judge,Detective Gant and Detective Skye were legendary partners. I personally saw them testify in numerous cases.
Rise from the ashes,6,915,Phoenix,"(She must have been good, coming from the same school as Mia...)"
Rise from the ashes,6,916,Lana,Damon Gant was a respectable detective. That's why...
Rise from the ashes,6,917,Lana,"There's no truth to this ""blackmail"" theory."
Rise from the ashes,6,918,Phoenix,"But think about it, Ms. Skye! You didn't murder Detective Goodman! You told me as much yesterday in jail!"
Rise from the ashes,6,919,Lana,"You still don't get it, do you Mr. Wright? Any testimony you cannot present in court is as useless as idle gossip."
Rise from the ashes,6,920,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,921,Lana,I stabbed Detective Goodman with a knife. And...
Rise from the ashes,6,922,Lana,I fabricated the evidence two years ago all by myself.
Rise from the ashes,6,923,Phoenix,Did you do so to help your sister?
Rise from the ashes,6,924,Lana,Joe Darke was a serial killer. My sister almost became his last victim that day. I didn't want that incident to ruin her life.
Rise from the ashes,6,925,Phoenix,But what she did was justifiable self-defense! She wouldn't have been charged with anything...
Rise from the ashes,6,926,Lana,"That's not the point. She was traumatized that day, all because of that creep! That's why I couldn't forgive him."
Rise from the ashes,6,927,Ema,Lana...
Rise from the ashes,6,928,Judge,So that's why you fabricated the evidence two years ago?
Rise from the ashes,6,929,Lana,"When I found Prosecutor Marshall's body, I rearranged the crime scene."
Rise from the ashes,6,930,Phoenix,You say you did this all by yourself?
Rise from the ashes,6,931,Lana,Yes.
Rise from the ashes,6,932,Edgeworth,Would you mind telling us what you found when you arrived at the crime scene?
Rise from the ashes,6,933,Lana,... It seems I was the first person to discover the scene. The broken prosecutor award knife was stuck in the victim's body.
Rise from the ashes,6,934,Phoenix,"What!? But Prosecutor Marshall died from an unfortunate ""accident""!"
Rise from the ashes,6,935,Lana,"That's only a situation you dreamed was ""possible."""
Rise from the ashes,6,936,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,937,Lana,"The reality is, it wasn't my sister who took the prosecutor's life! Fantasize all you want, Mr. Wright, but I'll never change this statement!"
Rise from the ashes,6,938,Edgeworth,"You mean, Prosecutor Marshall wound up being killed by Darke?"
Rise from the ashes,6,939,Lana,Something like that...
Rise from the ashes,6,940,Edgeworth,"If that is so, what happened to the other murder weapon? Darke was carrying a switchblade knife."
Rise from the ashes,6,941,Lana,"Oh, that was lying on the floor a little distance away. It was probably knocked away in the struggle."
Rise from the ashes,6,942,Phoenix,(That's not how it went down! She's trying to cover up her lies with more lies!)
Rise from the ashes,6,943,Ema,All just to protect me...
Rise from the ashes,6,944,Judge,"So when you found the scene like this, what did you do? After all, this is what everything boils down to!"
Rise from the ashes,6,945,Lana,Yes...
Rise from the ashes,6,946,Lana,"I broke off the tip of Darke's knife, planted it inside the wound, then moved the body."
Rise from the ashes,6,947,Phoenix,You planted the tip of Darke's knife in the victim's wound?
Rise from the ashes,6,948,Judge,And then you moved the body?
Rise from the ashes,6,949,Edgeworth,But why!? Why would you do that...?
Rise from the ashes,6,950,Lana,"You of all people should know, Edgeworth. You've always had a good head on your shoulders."
Rise from the ashes,6,951,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,952,Phoenix,(My head isn't that bad... but maybe I ought to ask for the sake of the others...)
Rise from the ashes,6,953,Phoenix,"When you showed up on the scene, where exactly was the victim's body?"
Rise from the ashes,6,954,Lana,It was where you deduced it was - by Chief Gant's desk.
Rise from the ashes,6,955,Edgeworth,But the body was found by your desk. Why did you move it there?
Rise from the ashes,6,956,Lana,The reason for that is simple...
Rise from the ashes,6,957,Judge,Let's have the witness explain this in more detail. The reason Ms. Skye moved the body!
Rise from the ashes,6,958,Lana,The pieces of the jar that shattered during the events threatened my plan.
Rise from the ashes,6,959,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,960,Phoenix,"""Pieces of the jar..."" You mean...?"
Rise from the ashes,6,961,Lana,Yes. That wretched jar Mr. Wright showed us earlier. In order to show that Darke committed the crime... I felt it would be more expedient to move the body.
Rise from the ashes,6,962,Edgeworth,"So... when you first found the body, the jar was already..."
Rise from the ashes,6,963,Lana,"Of course. It had been shattered to pieces. If you looked at the crime scene, it would be clear right away what happened. Neil Marshall was dead, and Darke was lying unconscious... In other words, the jar must have been broken during their struggle."
Rise from the ashes,6,964,Judge,I see.
Rise from the ashes,6,965,Ema,...
Rise from the ashes,6,966,Phoenix,"What's the matter, Ema?"
Rise from the ashes,6,967,Ema,Apparently the jar shattered at the time the crime was committed. But I have a feeling there is more to it than that.
Rise from the ashes,6,968,Phoenix,(There must be a contradiction here somewhere!)
Rise from the ashes,6,969,Lana,"Anyway, I committed this fabrication completely alone."
Rise from the ashes,6,970,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,971,Phoenix,"Ms. Skye, I understand how you feel. You committed that ""crime"" two years ago to protect your sister."
Rise from the ashes,6,972,Judge,You mean the forgery at the scene where Neil Marshall was murdered?
Rise from the ashes,6,973,Phoenix,"If that truth were to be exposed now, the past two years of your life will have been useless. Even so, I am compelled to bring to everyone's attention a significant contradiction within your testimony!"
Rise from the ashes,6,974,Lana,A contradiction... in my testimony?
Rise from the ashes,6,975,Phoenix,"You testified, and I quote, ""The pieces of the jar that shattered during the events threatened my plan."""
Rise from the ashes,6,976,Lana,That's right...
Rise from the ashes,6,977,Judge,Do you have a problem with that?
Rise from the ashes,6,978,Phoenix,"It's a simple oversight, really. You see, a message was written on this jar with the victim's blood."
Rise from the ashes,6,979,Lana,Yes. The prosecutor must have written it in his final moments.
Rise from the ashes,6,980,Phoenix,Exactly so. And this is where the contradiction lies.
Rise from the ashes,6,981,Lana,!
Rise from the ashes,6,982,Phoenix,"In order for the victim to be able to write his message on the jar, it must not yet have been broken before he died!"
Rise from the ashes,6,983,Lana,Ah...
Rise from the ashes,6,984,Phoenix,He couldn't have written Ema's name on a shattered jar!
Rise from the ashes,6,985,Judge,Order! Order!
Rise from the ashes,6,986,Edgeworth,"Your Honor. It would appear... more information is needed in regard to this jar, and its bloody message! We may be missing something critical here!"
Rise from the ashes,6,987,Phoenix,(Something critical...?)
Rise from the ashes,6,988,Edgeworth,Chief Prosecutor. It seems you're as in the dark as we are... about the truth towards which we're headed.
Rise from the ashes,6,989,Lana,What...?
Rise from the ashes,6,990,Edgeworth,Just tell us exactly what you saw. We'll piece together the information to arrive at the truth.
Rise from the ashes,6,991,Judge,Very well! The witness may now continue her testimony!
Rise from the ashes,6,992,Lana,...
Rise from the ashes,6,993,Judge,You mean you were the one who wiped away this message in blood!?
Rise from the ashes,6,994,Lana,I wasn't Chief Prosecutor at the time.
Rise from the ashes,6,995,Ema,"She didn't think Darke was the real murderer. That's why she tried to erase the ""real evidence."""
Rise from the ashes,6,996,Judge,Very well. The defense may now begin its cross-examination.
Rise from the ashes,6,997,Lana,"I immediately noticed the blood traces on the jar,"
Rise from the ashes,6,998,Phoenix,So the jar was already broken?
Rise from the ashes,6,999,Lana,It's a miracle that thing hadn't broken earlier.
Rise from the ashes,6,1000,Judge,It certainly looks as feeble as the defense's case...
Rise from the ashes,6,1001,Phoenix,(But not as feeble as the judge's judgment...)
Rise from the ashes,6,1002,Edgeworth,You were an ace detective who never missed a detail. Do you really expect us to believe you didn't investigate what was written on the jar pieces?
Rise from the ashes,6,1003,Lana,"Normally I would have,"
Rise from the ashes,6,1004,Lana,but it was dark in the room and I didn't have time to check it out.
Rise from the ashes,6,1005,Phoenix,So you didn't know your sister's name was written on the jar?
Rise from the ashes,6,1006,Lana,No. If I had known... I would have gathered all the pieces and ground them to dust.
Rise from the ashes,6,1007,Phoenix,"(Well, that helps my case...)"
Rise from the ashes,6,1008,Ema,Lana... you'd do that for me?
Rise from the ashes,6,1009,Phoenix,It seems you two might make up yet.
Rise from the ashes,6,1010,Lana,"Anyway, I just barely had enough time to move the body as it was."
Rise from the ashes,6,1011,Edgeworth,"If someone happened upon the scene, you'd lose your chance to erase the evidence. You must have been in a hurry."
Rise from the ashes,6,1012,Lana,I was. I knew I had to destroy the evidence before anyone came.
Rise from the ashes,6,1013,Judge,This is rather shocking...
Rise from the ashes,6,1014,Lana,"To be safe, I wiped away the blood."
Rise from the ashes,6,1015,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1016,Phoenix,I'm afraid this action of yours reveals what really happened.
Rise from the ashes,6,1017,Judge,What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,6,1018,Phoenix,"If you really thought Darke killed Prosecutor Marshall, you wouldn't have wiped away the blood."
Rise from the ashes,6,1019,Lana,... What else could I have done in that situation?
Rise from the ashes,6,1020,Ema,Lana...
Rise from the ashes,6,1021,Lana,I only had a few moments. There wasn't enough time for me to do anything else but gather up the pieces.
Rise from the ashes,6,1022,Lana,"The fragments were large, so I'm sure I got them all."
Rise from the ashes,6,1023,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1024,Phoenix,But how could you see with the power out? It should have been pitch black in that office.
Rise from the ashes,6,1025,Lana,"A detective is always prepared, Mr. Wright. Even now I always carry a pocket light and a camera with me."
Rise from the ashes,6,1026,Ema,Even I carry my a bottle of emergency Luminol wherever I go!
Rise from the ashes,6,1027,Lana,I never miss anything. I got every last piece.
Rise from the ashes,6,1028,Lana,All I could think about was wiping them clean before they were discovered.
Rise from the ashes,6,1029,Phoenix,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1030,Phoenix,So you illegally rearranged the crime scene?
Rise from the ashes,6,1031,Lana,Yes. I don't have any excuse for my actions.
Rise from the ashes,6,1032,Ema,"I'm so sorry, Lana. I didn't know... I've treated you so badly all this time..."
Rise from the ashes,6,1033,Phoenix,(It's not too late. There's still plenty of time to make up... After we've gotten to the bottom of this incident!)
Rise from the ashes,6,1034,Judge,No doubt this day will leave a permanent stain on the history of the Prosecutor's Office.
Rise from the ashes,6,1035,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1036,Phoenix,Ms. Skye. I believe this jar conceals a truth even you were unaware of.
Rise from the ashes,6,1037,Lana,What?
Rise from the ashes,6,1038,Phoenix,We found the final piece of this jar in Chief Gant's safe.
Rise from the ashes,6,1039,Lana,In the Chief's safe? But how...?
Rise from the ashes,6,1040,Phoenix,(I knew it! She really didn't know!) There's something even more disturbing about that final piece: There was still blood on it.
Rise from the ashes,6,1041,Judge,But the witness just testified... that she gathered every last piece and wiped the blood off of them!
Rise from the ashes,6,1042,Phoenix,"Yes, which leaves us with only one explanation. On the night Prosecutor Marshall was murdered... you were not the first one to show up on the scene! Chief Gant got there before you!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1043,Judge,But couldn't the defendant have simply missed a piece?
Rise from the ashes,6,1044,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1045,Phoenix,"I'm afraid that's unlikely. The pieces are too big for anyone to miss, let alone an ace detective!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1046,Judge,"That may well be, but everyone makes mistakes. Even I once wasted an entire day looking for my dentures. They were in my mouth all along! Ha! Can you believe that!?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1047,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1048,Edgeworth,"Have you forgotten, Your Honor? When this witness arrived at the scene, the jar was already broken."
Rise from the ashes,6,1049,Judge,"Oh, that..."
Rise from the ashes,6,1050,Edgeworth,There's no way a name could have been written on a shattered jar. Another person discovered the scene prior to the witness!
Rise from the ashes,6,1051,Judge,"I hope you're not implying this ""person"" was Chief Gant. At the time, he was looking for Darke downstairs. Besides, even if he was there first, why would he break the jar?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1052,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1053,Phoenix,"The question is, if he did arrive there first, why did he hide that fact for two years!?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1054,Judge,...
Rise from the ashes,6,1055,Phoenix,"Well, Your Honor? Can you answer us that!?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1056,Judge,Nnnnn... NNNNGHAAAAAAA! Noooooooooooo!
Rise from the ashes,6,1057,Judge,"Wait, I'm not the one on trial here!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1058,Edgeworth,"Damon Gant arrived at the crime scene prior to the witness. He proceeded to break the jar, and purposefully hid one of the broken pieces. Question: What is this action called?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1059,Phoenix,Fabrication...
Rise from the ashes,6,1060,Judge,B-but why would Chief Gant do that!?
Rise from the ashes,6,1061,Edgeworth,"In light of what happened afterwards, isn't it clear?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1062,Judge,What happened afterwards...?
Rise from the ashes,6,1063,Edgeworth,"Discovering the scene, Lana Skye believed her sister Ema killed the victim. Determined to help her sister, she sought Gant's aid. Lending her his ""aid,"" Gant helped her create evidence that incriminated Darke, sparing Ema. And here is the reason! The reason why Ms. Skye became the Chief's puppet!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1064,Lana,...!! N-no... I... I did it on my own...
Rise from the ashes,6,1065,Ema,"Please, Sis! Stop trying to protect the Chief! I... I can't watch you suffer any more for my sake..."
Rise from the ashes,6,1066,Lana,"No, you didn't! It wasn't you, Ema! You didn't kill anyone! Don't believe anything Mr. Wright says! Defense attorneys make up the he most foul lies to defend their clients!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1067,Phoenix,"""Foul lies""...? (Imagine that, coming from my own client!)"
Rise from the ashes,6,1068,Judge,Hmm... I guess you do seem the type who likes to twist the truth.
Rise from the ashes,6,1069,Phoenix,...! (Wait a minute... What if... we're still smack dab in the middle of Gant's trap!?)
Rise from the ashes,6,1070,Judge,"Is something wrong, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1071,Phoenix,Lana... may be right after all.
Rise from the ashes,6,1072,Edgeworth,"! What do you mean, Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1073,Ema,"So you do tell foul lies then, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1074,Phoenix,Ms. Skye! Please testify once more!
Rise from the ashes,6,1075,Lana,But...
Rise from the ashes,6,1076,Phoenix,"If evidence was ""fabricated"" behind your back... then Ema's accidental killing of Prosecutor Marshall... might also be a lie!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1077,Ema,"B-but, I do remember knocking over Mr. Marshall..."
Rise from the ashes,6,1078,Phoenix,Ms. Skye! If you will!
Rise from the ashes,6,1079,Lana,... I... I can't...
Rise from the ashes,6,1080,Edgeworth,There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.
Rise from the ashes,6,1081,Lana,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1082,Edgeworth,"This cross-examination may not change a thing. However, there is a possibility that it will, if you tell the truth!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1083,Lana,... Very well. I'll testify... about what I really saw.
Rise from the ashes,6,1084,Judge,"All right. The witness may testify once more, for the final time!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1085,Judge,Unbelievable! The body was impaled on the armor's sword?
Rise from the ashes,6,1086,Edgeworth,You were the only one who saw that. If only you had proof...
Rise from the ashes,6,1087,Lana,"... Actually, I do have proof."
Rise from the ashes,6,1088,Edgeworth,!
Rise from the ashes,6,1089,Lana,I gave it to Mr. Wright just this morning.
Rise from the ashes,6,1090,Phoenix,What? To me!?
Rise from the ashes,6,1091,Lana,It's a picture I took of the crime scene as I encountered it. I thought it might be needed.
Rise from the ashes,6,1092,Phoenix,But I don't remember receiving a picture like that...
Rise from the ashes,6,1093,Ema,Lana must have known... See. Mr. Wright? She really does have faith in you!
Rise from the ashes,6,1094,Judge,"Very well, Mr. Wright. Please present this ""picture""!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1095,Phoenix,(I don't remember receiving any pictures from Lana...)
Rise from the ashes,6,1096,Ema,"Lana said she gave it to you this morning, right?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1097,Phoenix,I seem to remember getting something from her then...
Rise from the ashes,6,1098,Ema,Let's check that evidence again! There must be a picture in there somewhere!
Rise from the ashes,6,1099,Phoenix,Hey... There's a picture here!
Rise from the ashes,6,1100,Ema,Oh... Oh my... This is... the actual crime scene...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1101,Lana,No other detective saw the crime scene like this. That's because I contacted Criminal Affairs only after I rearranged the scene.
Rise from the ashes,6,1102,Ema,*gasp* Mr. Wright! That piece cut out from his vest! Could that be...
Rise from the ashes,6,1103,Phoenix,(The cloth we found inside Chief Gant's safe!)
Rise from the ashes,6,1104,Phoenix,What's this?
Rise from the ashes,6,1105,Ema,It's... a handprint.
Rise from the ashes,6,1106,Ema,That cloth... It had fingerprints on it! Whosever fingerprints those are must be the real murderer!
Rise from the ashes,6,1107,Phoenix,"(What!? But those fingerprints... They're yours, Ema!)"
Rise from the ashes,6,1108,Ema,"Why are your lips turning all purple, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1109,Edgeworth,"Anyway, let's get on with the cross-examination. So long as you tell the truth, we should be able to flush out the real murderer."
Rise from the ashes,6,1110,Judge,Very well. The defense may now begin its cross-examination.
Rise from the ashes,6,1111,Lana,"When I arrived, I found Mr. Marshall's body impaled on that suit of armor's sword."
Rise from the ashes,6,1112,Gant,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1113,Gant,"Come now, Udgey. This is the poorest excuse for a trial I've ever seen!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1114,Judge,Chief Gant...
Rise from the ashes,6,1115,Gant,"What, now you want to make me out as the bad guy too? If so, I'd like to put in a word or two in my defense."
Rise from the ashes,6,1116,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1117,Edgeworth,I'm afraid it's too late for that.
Rise from the ashes,6,1118,Gant,What?
Rise from the ashes,6,1119,Edgeworth,You already declined testimony. That means you forfeited your right to make statements of any sort.
Rise from the ashes,6,1120,Gant,...
Rise from the ashes,6,1121,Phoenix,"(This must be the ""risk"" the judge was talking about...)"
Rise from the ashes,6,1122,Edgeworth,"Just sit back, relax... and enjoy the sound of the noose tightening around your own neck."
Rise from the ashes,6,1123,Gant,"GGGCCKCKCCKKKK...! ... Ah, so what? You think I'm worried?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1124,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1125,Gant,"Sorry to disappoint you, but I don't need to make any statements."
Rise from the ashes,6,1126,Edgeworth,What do you mean?
Rise from the ashes,6,1127,Gant,"The evidence will do all the talking for me. Even if I can't testify, I can still present evidence."
Rise from the ashes,6,1128,Judge,"Yes, that's true... Wait! You mean... you still have some conclusive evidence?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1129,Gant,"No, I don't. But someone does."
Rise from the ashes,6,1130,Judge,"""Someone""...?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1131,Gant,So then... what's your excuse Wrighto?
Rise from the ashes,6,1132,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1133,Gant,"Why have you been keeping quiet about it? You do have something to show us, right? Something that proves who knocked over Neil Marshall, causing his death. Conclusive evidence, that leaves no room for doubt!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1134,Judge,"I-is this true, Mr. Wright!?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1135,Phoenix,... (If I show that piece of evidence now... Ema's sure to be made out as the murderer!)
Rise from the ashes,6,1136,Judge,"Mr. Wright! If you have any more evidence, present it now! And if you try to conceal anything... you will be the one appearing before the Board of Inquiries!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1137,Phoenix,(What do I do now!? I'd better think this through carefully. I can't afford to make the wrong decision! Should I present that piece of evidence? The one that shows who really killed Prosecutor Marshall?)
Rise from the ashes,6,1138,Phoenix,"Your Honor, I don't have any evidence I can present at this point in time."
Rise from the ashes,6,1139,Gant,What!? You lie!
Rise from the ashes,6,1140,Judge,Chief Gant?
Rise from the ashes,6,1141,Gant,You... you opened my safe! I know you took what was inside! The conclusive evidence!
Rise from the ashes,6,1142,Phoenix,I don't know what you're talking about.
Rise from the ashes,6,1143,Ema,Mr. Wright! Why don't you show them? We found it together!
Rise from the ashes,6,1144,Gant,"Oh, I see. It's because you know the truth, don't you? You know whose fingerprints are on it. That's why you won't present it!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1145,Edgeworth,"What are you talking about, Chief Gant!?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1146,Gant,Can't you figure it out? Take a good look at this picture. See the victim's vest? Notice anything odd about the chest area?
Rise from the ashes,6,1147,Judge,It looks like part of it's been cut off for some reason.
Rise from the ashes,6,1148,Edgeworth,"You mean, you had this...? In your safe?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1149,Judge,What!? That means you... the Chief of Police... concealing evidence! This is going to be the biggest scandal in the history of the Police Department!!!
Rise from the ashes,6,1150,Gant,"... Impressive... To be honest, I didn't think you had the gall, Wrighto."
Rise from the ashes,6,1151,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1152,Gant,"Well, I can't just let you pin me up as the murderer. I'll tell you what really happened."
Rise from the ashes,6,1153,Judge,What!? You mean you admit to it!?
Rise from the ashes,6,1154,Gant,I was the first person to arrive at the crime scene that day. It then occurred to me that I could use the situation to control Lana.
Rise from the ashes,6,1155,Ema,So you really were manipulating her!
Rise from the ashes,6,1156,Gant,"I knew Lana. If I made it look like the blame lay with her sister... That when she saw the scene, she would ask me for my aid."
Rise from the ashes,6,1157,Edgeworth,"So you ""assisted"" Ms. Skye!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1158,Gant,"I told her to arrange all the evidence. I had her plant the knife tip in the victim's body, and move the body across the room."
Rise from the ashes,6,1159,Edgeworth,And I ended up using that evidence to get Joe Darke convicted!
Rise from the ashes,6,1160,Gant,"When we rearranged the crime scene, I hid two pieces of evidence. I did this before Lana arrived at the scene."
Rise from the ashes,6,1161,Phoenix,Two pieces of evidence... You mean those items in your safe!
Rise from the ashes,6,1162,Judge,But... why?
Rise from the ashes,6,1163,Gant,"For insurance, of course."
Rise from the ashes,6,1164,Phoenix,"""Insurance""...?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1165,Gant,"I was sure my plan would work, but it's always bet to be prepared for the worst. I wasn't about to let anyone blame me for a murder that girl committed."
Rise from the ashes,6,1166,Judge,You mean you were calculating that far ahead while forging the evidence!?
Rise from the ashes,6,1167,Gant,"Who do you take me for, a fool? I didn't make police chief by dumb luck. See this jar fragment? I hid the most legible part of Ema's name. I didn't expect Lana to go and wipe the blood off all the pieces."
Rise from the ashes,6,1168,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1169,Edgeworth,"But if you fabricated all the evidence... what's to say you didn't fabricate the message on this jar, too?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1170,Gant,"Ho ho ho... Some people just don't know when to quit, do they? That's why I kept one more item for ""insurance."""
Rise from the ashes,6,1171,Edgeworth,You mean that piece of cloth?
Rise from the ashes,6,1172,Gant,"Come on, Wrighto. Cough it up, already. I know you have it."
Rise from the ashes,6,1173,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,6,1174,Ema,"What are you waiting for, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1175,Phoenix,"So you admit to it then, Chief Gant? That you were hiding the cloth you cut off the victim's vest in your safe?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1176,Gant,"Yes, I admit it. I didn't want to have to do that, being Chief and all, but it's a lot better than being portrayed as a murderer!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1177,Judge,"Well, Mr. Wright? What do you have to say for yourself? Just a moment ago, you said you didn't have any evidence you could present."
Rise from the ashes,6,1178,Gant,"Foolish move, Wrighto. You should have shown it then before it was too late."
Rise from the ashes,6,1179,Phoenix,"(It's been a long battle... but the moment of truth has finally arrived! As long as I don't mess up here, victory is mine!)"
Rise from the ashes,6,1180,Phoenix,"Your Honor, I do have evidence to present now."
Rise from the ashes,6,1181,Judge,"All right then, let's see this ""conclusive"" evidence! The evidence that shows who actually murdered Prosecutor Marshall!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1182,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1183,Phoenix,"Let me verify this once more. On the day of the crime, you personally cut out this piece of the victim's vest?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1184,Gant,"Oh, yes! At last you've finally brought it out into the open."
Rise from the ashes,6,1185,Judge,There's a handprint on this piece of cloth!
Rise from the ashes,6,1186,Edgeworth,Your Honor! The prosecution requests that be immediately sent to the lab for analysis! This handprint on the leather... There must have been a strong impact for it to be left so clearly!
Rise from the ashes,6,1187,Judge,! You mean...
Rise from the ashes,6,1188,Edgeworth,"It could not have been forged. It must be authentic, conclusive evidence!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1189,Gant,"Ho ho ho... You're as slow on the uptake as ever, Worthy!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1190,Edgeworth,What?
Rise from the ashes,6,1191,Gant,Think about it. Wrighto had all this time to present this evidence... Yet he was reluctant to do so. Why would that be?
Rise from the ashes,6,1192,Edgeworth,...! You mean you already know? You know whose fingerprints are on that?
Rise from the ashes,6,1193,Ema,M-Mr. Wright... Do you really know?
Rise from the ashes,6,1194,Judge,Whoever the fingerprints belong to must be the real murderer! Whose fingerprints are they!?
Rise from the ashes,6,1195,Phoenix,Very well. I'll tell you. (It should be okay now. Everything's proceeding as predicted.) The person whom these fingerprints belong to are...
Rise from the ashes,6,1196,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1197,Judge,Ema? Ema Skye!?
Rise from the ashes,6,1198,Ema,What!? They're mine...!?
Rise from the ashes,6,1199,Phoenix,"I'm sorry, Ema..."
Rise from the ashes,6,1200,Ema,But why... Why didn't you tell me!?
Rise from the ashes,6,1201,Gant,"Oh ho ho ho! You're really something, Wrighto! You knew this girl did it all along, and you still tried to pin the murder on me!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1202,Judge,"So it's true. Tragic, but true. This girl really did shove Prosecutor Marshall to his death."
Rise from the ashes,6,1203,Lana,Holdit.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1204,Lana,How could you!? You... you monster!!!
Rise from the ashes,6,1205,Judge,Ms. Skye...
Rise from the ashes,6,1206,Lana,"You knew whose fingerprints those were all along, yet you... you acted like she really didn't..."
Rise from the ashes,6,1207,Phoenix,Ms. Skye. It's not over yet...
Rise from the ashes,6,1208,Lana,What!?
Rise from the ashes,6,1209,Phoenix,I said this trial isn't over yet.
Rise from the ashes,6,1210,Gant,"Ha! But I'm afraid it is over, boy! Not only this trial... but your career too!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1211,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,6,1212,Gant,"You purposely concealed this conclusive evidence. That, my friend, is a serious offense."
Rise from the ashes,6,1213,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,6,1214,Gant,"I'm looking forward to pressing charges after the defendant is convicted. I'll have your badge, boy!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1215,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,6,1216,Gant,"What's the matter, cat got your tongue? Aren't you going to tell us how it feels? How it feels to be the one who single-handedly turned a poor little girl into a murderer!?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1217,Phoenix,... Before I do that... there's just one little thing I have to clear up.
Rise from the ashes,6,1218,Gant,Oh? And what's that?
Rise from the ashes,6,1219,Phoenix,Who really killed Prosecutor Neil Marshall.
Rise from the ashes,6,1220,Judge,What!?
Rise from the ashes,6,1221,Phoenix,"Chief Gant, you are absolutely right. This piece of cloth proves who the real murderer is. Who killed Neil Marshall, you ask?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1222,Judge,"It was Ema Skye, wasn't it?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1223,Phoenix,"I'm afraid that's not possible. You see, this piece of cloth contains a critical contradiction!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1224,Gant,What!? A contradiction!? What is this fool babbling about!?
Rise from the ashes,6,1225,Phoenix,I'm talking about a contradiction. One that proves... who the real killer is!
Rise from the ashes,6,1226,Judge,M-Mr. Wright! This piece of cloth... What could it possibly contradict!?
Rise from the ashes,6,1227,Phoenix,"(Chief Gant, your tyrannical reign ends here!) Behold! The piece of evidence that contradicts this cloth!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1228,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1229,Gant,And what exactly is this supposed to be...?
Rise from the ashes,6,1230,Phoenix,This is the picture Ms. Skye took. Take a good look at it. See where the piece of his vest was cut out?
Rise from the ashes,6,1231,Judge,"Yes... His shirt is showing underneath. It's hard to make out with all the blood on his vest, though."
Rise from the ashes,6,1232,Phoenix,Exactly my point. His chest is soaked with blood. That's only natural. His lungs no doubt were punctured. Blood poured out of his mouth.
Rise from the ashes,6,1233,Judge,Oh! But that piece of cloth... Wait... There's no blood on it!
Rise from the ashes,6,1234,Gant,AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
Rise from the ashes,6,1235,Phoenix,"Since Ema Skye's fingerprints are on this cloth, there's no doubt that she shoved the prosecutor aside! However! Mr. Marshall was not impaled on the sword!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1236,Gant,No! Th-this is nonsense!
Rise from the ashes,6,1237,Phoenix,"Now then, Chief Gant. Let me ask you something. Prosecutor Marshall was not impaled when he was shoved aside."
Rise from the ashes,6,1238,Edgeworth,He most likely hit his head on the ground and was knocked out.
Rise from the ashes,6,1239,Phoenix,"If so, then tell me. Who could it have been? Who could have arrived at the scene before Ms. Skye, picked up the unconscious prosecutor, and impaled him on the armor's sword?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1240,Gant,Hnnngngghgghh...
Rise from the ashes,6,1241,Edgeworth,"Then, to make it look like Ema was responsible for the prosecutor's death, said person proceeded to write her name on the jar with the victim's blood. Then he broke the jar on purpose, to leave behind a clue, and make Lana believe her sister did it!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1242,Gant,...
Rise from the ashes,6,1243,Phoenix,"Remember what you admitted only moments ago? That you personally cut out this bloodless piece of the victim's vest? Ironic, isn't it? Through the very act of creating ""insurance,"" you proved that you were the actual murderer!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1244,Gant,NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Rise from the ashes,6,1245,Phoenix,(It's finished...)
Rise from the ashes,6,1246,Gant,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1247,Gant,"Heh... Heh heh heh! Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho! That was close, Wrighto! You almost had me!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1248,Phoenix,!
Rise from the ashes,6,1249,Gant,"Sorry, but you'll have to do better than that. I refute your allegations."
Rise from the ashes,6,1250,Judge,"What do you mean, you ""refute"" his allegations?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1251,Gant,"You see, that piece of cloth... is illegal evidence!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1252,Judge,Order! Order! What nonsense is this!?
Rise from the ashes,6,1253,Gant,"Illegal evidence cannot be used to convict a suspect! Remember, Udgey? Earlier, ol' Wrighto here concealed that piece of cloth!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1254,Gant,"So then... what's your excuse Wrighto? You do have some conclusive evidence, don't you?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1255,Phoenix,"... Your Honor, I don't have any evidence I can present at this point in time."
Rise from the ashes,6,1256,Judge,"Well, that's true... The defense did refuse to present evidence!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1257,Gant,"At that moment, that piece of cloth ceased to be ""legal evidence""!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1258,Ema,But that's not fair...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1259,Gant,"Hoo hoo hoo hooooo! Did you actually think you could best me in court? It looks like the last laugh's on you, son!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1260,Judge,"I'm afraid Mr. Gant's claim is legally correct. Well, Mr. Edgeworth?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1261,Edgeworth,"True... Illegal evidence cannot be used to convict a person... assuming, of course, that the evidence is indeed illegal."
Rise from the ashes,6,1262,Judge,"Hmm? Well, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1263,Phoenix,... (It seems... at last... The time for me to reveal my plan has finally arrived.)
Rise from the ashes,6,1264,Judge,Mr. Wright. Do you admit to it? That you purposefully and illegally concealed this piece of cloth?
Rise from the ashes,6,1265,Phoenix,"Certainly, I refused to present evidence at one point."
Rise from the ashes,6,1266,Gant,Aha! So the evidence is illegal!
Rise from the ashes,6,1267,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1268,Phoenix,"No it isn't, Mr. Gant."
Rise from the ashes,6,1269,Gant,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,6,1270,Phoenix,"It's not that I ""didn't"" present evidence then... it's that I ""couldn't."""
Rise from the ashes,6,1271,Judge,"What do you mean, you ""couldn't""?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1272,Phoenix,There are certain procedures involved when presenting evidence!
Rise from the ashes,6,1273,Gant,"No, Udgey! Don't listen to his lies! He's nothing but a coward! You can't let him?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1274,Edgeworth,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1275,Edgeworth,There is only one issue left to be resolved in this trial: Is this evidence legal or not?
Rise from the ashes,6,1276,Judge,"Very well. Let us settle this once and for all. Earlier you refused to present evidence. If you can prove your conduct was not in violation of the law, then do so now!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1277,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1278,Phoenix,"This is my proof, Your Honor: ""Evidence Law."""
Rise from the ashes,6,1279,Gant,What's this?
Rise from the ashes,6,1280,Phoenix,"I've done my homework too, Chief. Indeed, Ema Skye's fingerprints were on this piece of cloth. However! At that point in time, this was merely a piece of cloth, nothing more."
Rise from the ashes,6,1281,Gant,What?
Rise from the ashes,6,1282,Phoenix,"You see, it's written right here in this book: The second rule of evidence law!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1283,Gant,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1284,Edgeworth,Rule 1: no evidence shall be shown without the approval of the Police Department!
Rise from the ashes,6,1285,Phoenix,I found this piece of evidence myself... inside your safe. It goes without saying I did not approval from the Police Department.
Rise from the ashes,6,1286,Edgeworth,Rule 2: unregistered evidence presented must be relevant to the case in trial.
Rise from the ashes,6,1287,Phoenix,"And here is the crux of the matter. You see, at the time it was impossible for me to prove the relevance... between the cloth and the SL-9 Incident."
Rise from the ashes,6,1288,Gant,"What!? What kind of nonsense is this!? You want ""relevancy""? Just take one look at this picture and-"
Rise from the ashes,6,1289,Phoenix,Objection.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1290,Phoenix,"Sorry, but can you recall... when was that picture presented?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1291,Judge,That was shown only a few moments ago!
Rise from the ashes,6,1292,Gant,No...
Rise from the ashes,6,1293,Edgeworth,"He's right. At the beginning of today's trial, that piece of cloth was still meaningless."
Rise from the ashes,6,1294,Phoenix,"The person who gave it value as evidence... was you, Damon Gant."
Rise from the ashes,6,1295,Gant,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1296,Edgeworth,"You yourself confessed to a certain ""truth."""
Rise from the ashes,6,1297,Phoenix,"Let me verify this once more. On the day of the crime, you personally cut out this piece of the victim's vest?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1298,Gant,"Oh, yes!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1299,Gant,NNNNOOOOO!!!
Rise from the ashes,6,1300,Edgeworth,"It was then that you approved this cloth... as conclusive evidence. Yes! You, the Chief of Police, personally approved this cloth!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1301,Phoenix,"The only person who could have cut this from the victim's vest... is the one who stood before Prosecutor Marshall in his final moments. In other words, the real murderer! And there's only one person who that could be... Damon Gant, the killer was you!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1302,Gant,"N... N... Mmph... WA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO UH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW!!! I knew I should have gotten rid of him... That good-for-nothing scum! For two years he's been snooping around the department trying to get something on me! Crimes are being committed everyday, yet he insisted on hounding me!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1303,Edgeworth,"Well, your crime wasn't exactly petty."
Rise from the ashes,6,1304,Gant,"He wanted to reinvestigate the case. He recruited Angel Starr, then convinced Bruce Goodman..."
Rise from the ashes,6,1305,Phoenix,Detective Goodman?
Rise from the ashes,6,1306,Gant,"Yeah, that's right."
Rise from the ashes,6,1307,Marshall,"If the evidence is transferred I'll lose my only chance to find out the truth! Please, you've got to help me!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1308,Gant,"Goodman turned him down, as he ought to. Still, Jake Marshall didn't know when to quit."
Rise from the ashes,6,1309,Edgeworth,He stole Goodman's ID card and tried to take the evidence!
Rise from the ashes,6,1310,Gant,Goodman came to me that day. He wanted to file a lost item report. I went with him to the evidence room. Then all of a sudden he had to speak out!
Rise from the ashes,6,1311,Gant,"What are you talking about, Goodman?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1312,Goodman,"Can you please reopen the investigation, Chief? We can't transfer the evidence out. There are too many questions left unanswered!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1313,Gant,He... told me to open up the evidence room and take it out.
Rise from the ashes,6,1314,Goodman,It's not too late. I'll hand this to Marshall!
Rise from the ashes,6,1315,Gant,"Well, to be honest, I was a little panicked, too. I had a bad feeling about it, but never knew it would come to this. That's when I saw it... that accursed knife. I couldn't just pull it out."
Rise from the ashes,6,1316,Edgeworth,You would only increase the amount of blood and you couldn't finish what you started.
Rise from the ashes,6,1317,Gant,"Even so, the blood was just pouring out. I didn't know who might stumble in, so I was wiping it up. I was worrying so much about the floor, I didn't realize my mistake."
Rise from the ashes,6,1318,Phoenix,Detective Gumshoe's bloody hand print...
Rise from the ashes,6,1319,Gant,"I used to be known as the ""crime computer""... But everyone has to start somewhere, I guess. I was too nervous. I had no business doing any of it."
Rise from the ashes,6,1320,Edgeworth,Then you put the body in my car?
Rise from the ashes,6,1321,Gant,"I'm sorry! We couldn't think of any other way to move the body. We broke the trunk, but what's the big deal? You pull down a lot more than us detectives!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1322,Edgeworth,Grr...
Rise from the ashes,6,1323,Phoenix,W-what does this have to do with anything? You're horrible! How could you get Ms. Skye involved in all of this!?
Rise from the ashes,6,1324,Gant,"Well, she had as much to lose as I did if the truth came out."
Rise from the ashes,6,1325,Edgeworth,So you took the evidence from Detective Goodman's locker?
Rise from the ashes,6,1326,Gant,I feel bad for having to do it. I couldn't sit around and pick and choose what to take.
Rise from the ashes,6,1327,Phoenix,Well... you left the jar fragment and gloves.
Rise from the ashes,6,1328,Gant,"... Yeah... It looks like I was better off being an investigator of crimes than a committer. They all did their best to get in my way... I've got to hand it to them, they do their jobs well... much to my dismay."
Rise from the ashes,6,1329,Edgeworth,Fake evidence doesn't hold up very well upon close examination. You must have known that...
Rise from the ashes,6,1330,Gant,"Tell me, Worthy. What are you doing in court?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1331,Edgeworth,Me?
Rise from the ashes,6,1332,Gant,You despise criminals. I can feel it. You and me... we're the same.
Rise from the ashes,6,1333,Edgeworth,!
Rise from the ashes,6,1334,Gant,One day you'll understand. If you want to take them on alone... you'll figure out what's needed!
Rise from the ashes,6,1335,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,6,1336,Gant,"Well, looks like it's time to say goodbye. Oh, Udgey."
Rise from the ashes,6,1337,Judge,Wh-what?
Rise from the ashes,6,1338,Gant,Looks like we'll have to cancel that lunch date. Sorry old friend!
Rise from the ashes,6,1339,Judge,"... I'm sorry too, Damon Gant."
Rise from the ashes,6,1340,Gant,...
Rise from the ashes,6,1341,Judge,"I knew you as you used to be, long ago. You were once a fine investigator, and an example to others on the force. I'm sorry to learn that you are no longer that person."
Rise from the ashes,6,1342,Gant,"Those days are gone now, Udgey. Thanks for all the memories, though... Don't worry, you'll be fine! Now you have Wrighto here... and Worthy. With these two around, you can't go wrong... You see, if I listen carefully, I can hear it right now... The sound of a new beginning!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1343,Phoenix,There are two things I want you to understand.
Rise from the ashes,6,1344,Lana,Yes?
Rise from the ashes,6,1345,Phoenix,"First, your sister never hurt anyone. Second, Damon Gant betrayed you from the beginning. You see, Ms. Skye... you no longer have any reason to keep silent."
Rise from the ashes,6,1346,Lana,"You're right. When this trial is over, I'll tell everything. All that I've done these past two years... from the time I had Gant help me forge evidence, up until today."
Rise from the ashes,6,1347,Judge,So... it seems all the questions raised in this trial have been answered.
Rise from the ashes,6,1348,Phoenix,"I'm sorry, Ms. Skye... I couldn't get you out of all your trouble."
Rise from the ashes,6,1349,Lana,"... My, my. What high standards you have... for a rookie."
Rise from the ashes,6,1350,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1351,Lana,"I can see why Mia thought so highly of you. Who knows? A few years from now, you just might make it to the top. I owe you my thanks, Mr. Wright."
Rise from the ashes,6,1352,Phoenix,Ms. Skye...
Rise from the ashes,6,1353,Lana,"And to you too, Mr. Edgeworth."
Rise from the ashes,6,1354,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1355,Lana,"You've suffered every bit as much as I have over these past few days. Believe me, I know how much of an ordeal it's been for you."
Rise from the ashes,6,1356,Edgeworth,Hmph! It was nothing.
Rise from the ashes,6,1357,Phoenix,(Liar...)
Rise from the ashes,6,1358,Lana,"I was worried the pressure might break you. And yet... you rose above it all and guided Mr. Wright to victory. You've done well, Mr. Edgeworth."
Rise from the ashes,6,1359,Edgeworth,S-stop it! I only did my job!
Rise from the ashes,6,1360,Judge,In light of this case... It seems a good self-examining is in order for all of us. Ms. Skye.
Rise from the ashes,6,1361,Lana,"Yes, Your Honor?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1362,Judge,"You are innocent of murder. However... Although the Chief blackmailed you, the fact is you still acted as his accomplice. A trial will be scheduled for these crimes at a later date."
Rise from the ashes,6,1363,Lana,"Yes. I understand, Your Honor."
Rise from the ashes,6,1364,Judge,Is there something amusing about all of this? Why are you smiling?
Rise from the ashes,6,1365,Lana,"It's been a long time, Your Honor. A long time since I've felt free of these heavy chains..."
Rise from the ashes,6,1366,Judge,"Well, this trial has gone on far too long already. Regarding the charge of murder, this court finds the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye..."
Rise from the ashes,6,1367,Judge,Not Guilty
Rise from the ashes,6,1368,Judge,That is all. The court is adjourned!
Rise from the ashes,6,1369,Phoenix,(At long last... It's finally over...) E-Ema?
Rise from the ashes,6,1370,Ema,...
Rise from the ashes,6,1371,Phoenix,"Why the long face? I'm sorry your sister didn't get completely off the hook, but at least she wasn't convicted for a murder she didn't commit!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1372,Ema,"No, that's not it. Just now, after the trial ended..."
Rise from the ashes,6,1373,Lana,"I can see why Mia Fey thought so highly of you. I owe you my thanks, Mr. Wright. And to you too, Mr. Edgeworth."
Rise from the ashes,6,1374,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1375,Lana,You've suffered every bit as much as I have over these past few days. You've done well.
Rise from the ashes,6,1376,Ema,"You know, I did my best too. But... Lana didn't say a single word to me."
Rise from the ashes,6,1377,Gumshoe,Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Rise from the ashes,6,1378,Phoenix,...
Rise from the ashes,6,1379,Ema,...
Rise from the ashes,6,1380,Gumshoe,Oh... Guess I am. I'll come back later.
Rise from the ashes,6,1381,Phoenix,"Ah, Detective Gumshoe! What is it?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1382,Gumshoe,"You're doing this on purpose, aren't you? Making a detective run all around while on duty, and to top it off you call me here... I've seen happier people at funerals! Hey, lighten up, pals. I'm only kidding!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1383,Ema,Oh... Are you here because of my sister again?
Rise from the ashes,6,1384,Gumshoe,"Nope, not this time! I came today because of you, pal!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1385,Ema,Me...?
Rise from the ashes,6,1386,Gumshoe,That's right. I thought you'd like to see someone.
Rise from the ashes,6,1387,Ema,Lana!
Rise from the ashes,6,1388,Phoenix,"Should you be doing this? She's still under arrest, you know."
Rise from the ashes,6,1389,Gumshoe,"... Well, I won't tell if you won't."
Rise from the ashes,6,1390,Lana,Ema... I owe you an apology.
Rise from the ashes,6,1391,Ema,"It's okay, Sis. Don't worry about it."
Rise from the ashes,6,1392,Lana,"That day, two years ago,"
Rise from the ashes,6,1393,Ema,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1394,Lana,was the first time in my life I ever panicked. It was all I could do to keep myself from screaming. All I could think about was keeping you from getting wrapped up in that mess.
Rise from the ashes,6,1395,Ema,Sis...
Rise from the ashes,6,1396,Lana,"I asked Gant to help me cover up the ""truth."" I thought I was doing it for your sake... But now I realize I was wrong."
Rise from the ashes,6,1397,Ema,...
Rise from the ashes,6,1398,Lana,I changed after that day. I had to... It was the only way I could make it through the past two years. I knew how much I was hurting you by distancing myself... but I couldn't bring myself to tell you what I did. I... I was scared. Scared that you'd look at me with those eyes of yours. I was scared of how you'd react if you knew...
Rise from the ashes,6,1399,Ema,But Sis! You were only doing it for me...
Rise from the ashes,6,1400,Lana,No...
Rise from the ashes,6,1401,Ema,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,6,1402,Lana,"I turned my back on you that day. In hiding what I believed to be the truth, I was deceiving you!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1403,Ema,Sis...
Rise from the ashes,6,1404,Lana,I'm such a fool... It took me all this time to realize it. Ema... I'm so sorry.
Rise from the ashes,6,1405,Ema,But Sis! You don't have to apologize! I'm happy now!
Rise from the ashes,6,1406,Lana,You're... happy?
Rise from the ashes,6,1407,Ema,"Of course! You know, Sis, I always knew that one day you'd come back. And now you have!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1408,Lana,Oh Ema... Ema!
Rise from the ashes,6,1409,Phoenix,"No one can change the past. The only thing we can do is strive to make up for our mistakes. Why must we make up for our mistakes, you ask? Because in so doing... we can find the way back to our path. And once we've found our path, we can move on from our past mistakes toward a brighter future. At least, that's what I felt, looking at those two sisters make up."
Rise from the ashes,6,1410,Lana,Mr. Wright. Mr. Gumshoe.
Rise from the ashes,6,1411,Gumshoe,M-Me?
Rise from the ashes,6,1412,Lana,"Thank you both, for all that you've done. I'm sure we'll meet again someday. Isn't that right, Edgeworth?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1413,Phoenix,E-Edgeworth...?
Rise from the ashes,6,1414,Lana,Stop hiding and come over here.
Rise from the ashes,6,1415,Phoenix,(Where was he hiding!?)
Rise from the ashes,6,1416,Edgeworth,I just came to say... Congratulations.
Rise from the ashes,6,1417,Lana,Thank you.
Rise from the ashes,6,1418,Ema,"Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1419,Edgeworth,Right. Well... I'll be going now!
Rise from the ashes,6,1420,Lana,Mr. Edgeworth. I hope you don't blame yourself for what happened.
Rise from the ashes,6,1421,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1422,Lana,"We were the ones who acted corruptly, not you."
Rise from the ashes,6,1423,Edgeworth,... It's too late for me.
Rise from the ashes,6,1424,Phoenix,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1425,Edgeworth,"No matter what anyone may say, I realized today that I can't change my own mistakes!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1426,Ema,Mr. Edgeworth...
Rise from the ashes,6,1427,Edgeworth,"Not only that, but I don't even trust myself anymore. Chief Gant was right..."
Rise from the ashes,6,1428,Gant,You despise criminals. I can feel it. You and me... we're the same.
Rise from the ashes,6,1429,Edgeworth,!
Rise from the ashes,6,1430,Gant,One day you'll understand. If you want to take them on alone... you'll figure out what's needed!
Rise from the ashes,6,1431,Edgeworth,"I do despise criminals. I planned to dedicate my entire life to fighting them. But in order to fight crime alone, one needs a ""weapon."" It's scary, but I've been thinking the same thing for quite some time now."
Rise from the ashes,6,1432,Phoenix,But Edgeworth...
Rise from the ashes,6,1433,Edgeworth,"Who knows? Given enough time, I might have tried to pull something like Chief Gant did. That thought terrifies me. That's why I can't continue on as a prosecutor!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1434,Lana,"Edgeworth... Don't you understand? Damon Gant and your mentor, Manfred von Karma..."
Rise from the ashes,6,1435,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1436,Lana,were both the best of the best when it came to fighting crime. But they both made the same mistake.
Rise from the ashes,6,1437,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,6,1438,Lana,"You said, ""in order to fight crime alone, one needs a weapon."" That may be right, but think back to today's trial. You weren't alone."
Rise from the ashes,6,1439,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1440,Lana,"You were working together with Mr. Wright. And because of that partnership, you were able to present evidence that otherwise would have gone undiscovered. Isn't that right, Mr. Wright?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1441,Phoenix,"Huh? What? Oh, uh... yeah. (What is this, a pop quiz?)"
Rise from the ashes,6,1442,Ema,"Come on, Mr. Wright! Show him what Lana's talking about!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1443,Phoenix,(Evidence... that neither Edgeworth nor I would have been able to find on our own?)
Rise from the ashes,6,1444,Phoenix,Takethat.gif
Rise from the ashes,6,1445,Ema,That's the picture I drew!
Rise from the ashes,6,1446,Phoenix,"Our counterattack began with this. You had one half of the evidence list, and I had the other. Apart, we wouldn't have been able to completely restore Ema's picture."
Rise from the ashes,6,1447,Lana,"That didn't just happen by ""chance,"" Edgeworth."
Rise from the ashes,6,1448,Edgeworth,...!
Rise from the ashes,6,1449,Edgeworth,... It's time for me to go.
Rise from the ashes,6,1450,Ema,Mr. Edgeworth...
Rise from the ashes,6,1451,Edgeworth,"If you'll excuse me... there are still some loose ends that need wrapping up. Take care, Chief Prosecutor."
Rise from the ashes,6,1452,Phoenix,Edgeworth! What will you do now?
Rise from the ashes,6,1453,Edgeworth,...
Rise from the ashes,6,1454,Phoenix,"Well, whatever you do, just remember. What happened in this trial can either make or break you as a prosecutor. In the end, it's up to you."
Rise from the ashes,6,1455,Edgeworth,"I know... It seems I owe you my thanks too, Wright. But what I face now... is my problem."
Rise from the ashes,6,1456,Phoenix,Edgeworth... I'll be waiting for you in court.
Rise from the ashes,6,1457,Edgeworth,... Farewell.
Rise from the ashes,6,1458,Lana,I'd better be getting back too.
Rise from the ashes,6,1459,Ema,Okay. I'll come visit you!
Rise from the ashes,6,1460,Lana,"It seems we both still have a lot to learn. Here, this is a little something for you."
Rise from the ashes,6,1461,Ema,"""Scientific Investigation""..."
Rise from the ashes,6,1462,Lana,It's the first book I ever bought. Study it well.
Rise from the ashes,6,1463,Ema,"Thanks, Sis! I will!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1464,Phoenix,"And so, another case came to a close. As for the sisters... I have faith. Faith that their lives... have only just begun. And as for me... I think it's time I started on a new journey of my own. A journey to rediscover myself."
Rise from the ashes,6,1465,Gumshoe,"Well, don't go trekking off just yet, pal!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1466,Phoenix,"Huh? What is it, Detective?"
Rise from the ashes,6,1467,Gumshoe,"There's just a little matter to be resolved about the Chief Prosecutor. You see, she isn't supposed to be out of jail like this."
Rise from the ashes,6,1468,Ema,But...
Rise from the ashes,6,1469,Phoenix,I thought you said it was okay.
Rise from the ashes,6,1470,Gumshoe,"Yeah, well it may be ""okay"" with me, but the folks at the prison are a different story."
Rise from the ashes,6,1471,Phoenix,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,6,1472,Gumshoe,"Basically, I had to bribe a guard in order to sneak her out for 30 minutes. Believe me, it wasn't cheap either!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1473,Phoenix,Huh?
Rise from the ashes,6,1474,Ema,"Way to go, Detective! I didn't know you had a wild side!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1475,Gumshoe,"Yeah, well... ha ha! You see... Mr. Wright here's the one who'll be footin' the bill."
Rise from the ashes,6,1476,Phoenix,Huh? Huh?
Rise from the ashes,6,1477,Gumshoe,"What, you think I could afford that with my salary? You gotta be kiddin' me, pal!"
Rise from the ashes,6,1478,Phoenix,Huh? Huh? Huh?
Rise from the ashes,6,1479,Ema,"Thank you, Mr. Wright! You're the best!"
