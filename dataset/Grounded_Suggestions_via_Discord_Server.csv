4/1/2022,"i feel like there isnt really enough damage types while we already have fresh, spicy and salty i feel like it wouldnt make sense not to include a sour damage type. sour shards sour shards would be a consumable that can be turned into globs and used on weapons to give them the sour damage bonus source of sour shards sour shards are exclusively a buried item which means they cant be found anywhere else exept areas where digging spots spawn. these shards would come from the sour lemonhead an old mildly sour candy made early 1960 how to harvest unlike most other candys this tough lemonhead would require a tier 3 axe is eating this worth it? yes and no. the sour shards would restore 25% hunger but would also reduce thirst by 5%",732,Feature,47,TRUE

4/3/2022,"I would like to see an Ice box/cooler added to the game as it would open up new weapons, a new damage type, and new mobs. A hostile mob could be the alaskan darkling beetle or arctic bumblebees. The new damage type could freeze the enemy for a few seconds.

4/3/2022,"Ok this is a short suggestion, but i think it would help. How about being able to upgrade ovens / Spinning wheels? They could be upgraded with charcoal and Lubricant if it gets added. These would make then go faster. and would be helpful.",238,Feature,53,TRUE
4/4/2022,"heavily buff the assistant manager, its extremely underwhelming and doesnt take that much time to kill. i'd suggest increasing its healthpool, as well as its defense increasing by 25% per enviromental hazard it creates (up to 50% if the tesla coils and lasers are active simultaneously)",286,Tweak,11,FALSE

4/5/2022,"Ok so, I was thinking about something, what completely viable early game combat strategy could be made into an endgame one? The throwing pebblets build! Currently, this class only goes up to really early on in the middle of the game where healbasas are introduced and then that's it! So I thought of some new items that the throwing class could have. Silk armour: As you constantly run from stick to leaf, waving your hands in massive arks to launch your projectiles, you turn to the most while, lightweight armour you can, and that means spider rope! •low defence •gives you the quickness (because this build would need it, and because it's a throwback to the old spider armour) •light armour •set bonus (pale white pummeller) makes your thrown projectiles faster (Plant glue, insect glue and upper yard bug gloop glue) glue clump! Don't ask how this is thrown or held. •all 3 variants work the same, they explode on impact slowing everything in the radius, the only difference is how slow it makes them •plant glue is made from 5 web fibre and 2 sap, insect is made from 3 web fibre and 1 spider venom and advanced is made from 2 bug gloop •does not deal damage Advanced throwing pebblets! LVL 1, Barbed pebblet: just does a reasonable amount of extra damage and sticks to the target 2 pebblets 1 sap 3 thistles LVL 2, venomous pebblet: poisons target as well as lots more damage 3 pebblets 2 web fibre 1 venom LVL 3, mega pebblet: damage per hit equal to that of a charged insect axe attack, also has a chance to stun 5 quartzite 10 bug gloop 2 raw lint 5 splinters",1568,Item,19,FALSE
4/5/2022,"Make some type of bridge that can be constructed, rather than hand making one with roof or floor pieces. An idea I have is a rope bridge, where you build two anchor points, use lint or silk rope to connect them, and then you could place weed stems, planks, or some other materials at the anchor points to build the bridge. Would allow for some cool designs",356,Item,30,FALSE
4/5/2022,give the three elemental types the ability to apply debuffs to enemies spicy would have a chance to apply the sizzle effect on enemies salty would have a chance to increase crit chance on enemies fresh would slow down enemy attacks,231,Feature,28,FALSE
4/6/2022,"In reality the antlions we see in game are just larvae. To make their cycle of life a bit more realistic we can make a passive dragonfly. Also, Antlions IRL smack their prey on the ground. It would cause players Heavy damage and make player unable to run. This would make the antlion something you want to avoid like the wolf spider rather than people bow spamming it. Which comes to my second suggestion: Making pit antlions able to get out of their pits",455,Tweak,10,FALSE
4/6/2022,"New smoothie concept: Dazzling ayahuasca As you may have noticed, more and more attacks from newer creatures have been immune from perfect blocking, take the broodmother scream or the IWS attacks for instance What if there was a way to bypass this? What if there was a way to perfect block anything and everything (maybe even fall damage but probably not idk)? Introducing the dazzling ayahuasca! This smoothie would be a bright, visually pleasing orange and would be made from 2 koi scales and a sunken bone. And, being remarkably similar to our favorite (and only) pb based armour set, I'd function the same as well allowing you to pb any and every attack with whatever weapon you deem adequate, as well as mildly increasing the perfect block window. No more getting evaporated and then inhaled by the IWS, no more instantly collapsing because the broodmilf is a bit too loud. It still wouldn't make the backyard into paradise, but it'd make it just a little bit less like insect heck (can't say h-e-l-l because the bot would instantly delete my suggestion if I did that unfortunately) Summary: •smoothie would be neon orange •costs 2 koi scales and 1 sunken bone •makes the pb window a tiny bit larger •makes any attack perfect blockable, like the broodscream or the IWS bite •the drink is poggers",1300,Item,15,FALSE
4/6/2022,"A tier 2 for juicy, using the juice boxes in the sandbox, picnic table, maybe one in the trash heap and atop the tarpaul on the upper yard. Would do the same thing but just better. Pretty self explanatory.",205,Item,20,FALSE

4/6/2022,"perhaps a mode for grounded called ""Locked"", You could pick a certain area you'll have to spend the WHOLE playthrough in, some stuff will be impossible to get, some stuff will be easy to get, some places would be hard etc. You could pick: Sandbox, Hedge + Eastern Flooded Zone, Pond(+ Oak tree surroundings), Woodpile(+ Deck) etc. I just think it would make a nice challenge lol, I know you can TECHNICALLY do it in the normal game, but I'd like it to be like no chance to cheat, maybe people will come with insane strats for an area? or just find it impossible to live in? Who knows",583,Feature,17,FALSE
4/6/2022,"Carry Cart: (This has been suggested before but I have a way to do it that nobody else has suggested) It would carry ten Grass Planks/Weed Stems, you could either carry it normally or use ant pheromones to get ants to do it. When the cart falls, it breaks and you need to repair it, you can prevent this by adding bee wings to it. You could also upgrade it to have a seat, meaning you can ride in it, or you could upgrade it to have 5+ carrying space, once you have upgraded to the chair. Once you have added on the chair, you cannot add anymore storage, but you can add one more chair. After adding more storage, you cannot add chairs, but can add 5+ storage",659,Item,24,FALSE
4/6/2022,"i think the edition of more early game area bug will add a lot of incentive to keep playing for newer players, since most players just encounter red ants,weevils and aphids with the occasional larva. I think adding more early game bugs will make the game much more interesting. Maybe more hostile bugs. Maybe ticks, fleas and flys can be added in the early grassland area",371,Feature,17,FALSE
4/7/2022,"I speak in the name of riku and friends community. The game Grounded, I got as a gift from one of my twitch followers. I liked this game from the Beginning, You can experience close up, The Mother's Nature can give a coat. But the Fight that you have to earn a place. In the course of my streams and off Screen Runs. I am many things We noticed we spoke many hours about things. Values ​​Developer, Dear Grounded Community. 1st Idea Caterpillar (Caterpenous Skin and Rape Meat) Recipe Idea: Level 2 Armor Caterpillar Helmet / Vest / Shoes (Beetle and Larvae do not take you as a Danger until you attack them, Set Effect: You need less Water and Food) Later, The Caterpillars become Cocoons (Evolution Baby! xD) The give Silk and Crawler Meat to be too butterflies (You Lake Evolution What is breathtaking) Butterflies drop Butterfly Wing Which One can make to Butterfly Glider (Recipe). With which One can fly back on things and slide through the Air BUT! That costs Endurance, No Endurance = End of the Flight Time So it's worth a duration to boost. So as an alternative to the dandelion glider And you can fly small Obstacles or build simpler bases 2nd Idea If You could bend with the ants. Not Only at first where you wear a LV 1 Ants Armour. But so Later at Late Game I would like to fight with you against Beetle and Spiders. As allies They are almost everywhere, in the garden But i would like to have black ants as friend either and an ant pet  The ants were the first thing that I was very enthusiastic in Grounded Make the ants great again ! ^^ THANK YOU THAT YOU HAVE Read All this Through And a Huge Thank You If You Support IT.

4/8/2022,I think a Pupa leather couch that 2 people could sit on at a time would be a great lore friendly bit of furniture and would be something that’s a bit higher level to use,169,Feature,40,TRUE
4/8/2022,"I'm gonna keep this suggestion pretty vague, as there are many ways this can be done, but it's just the main idea I want to get across. Plugging the gas canister is proving to be a big part of the story of the game and can easily take the game in many directions. What I want to suggest is that the choice can lead to a split path in the endgame. What I suggest is a late game area that if chosen to plug the haze, is covered in fungus and infected creatures and fungi, but if choosing to keep the haze as it is, is completely different. This can add replayability to the game and really give the feel of the player making an impact on the backyard. In reality not many unique resources could be in either place, maybe a unique boss either way, but as I said I'm keeping this suggestion vague as this can really be taken any direction.",835,Feature,24,FALSE
4/8/2022,"We have orb weaver juniors but it would be interesting to see other bugs have smaller versions that can drop less parts and travel areas a lot less freely. It would be interesting to potentially see young travelling with their elders, potentially making the elders more aggressive and protective. Wolf spider juniors would be interesting to patrol very close to the oak tree, and they could potentially be neutral due to a lack of understanding of hostility. If you were to attack one it would be cool if it would cause a regular sized one would come out to investigate and check if it's ok? I'm not sure how that would work with other bugs but I'd love to see it in grounded",675,Feature,15,FALSE

4/8/2022,Hey! I have one suggestion that I think would be cool too see. I’d love to see a terrain shovel as when I am building my base the dirt on the floor sticks through and it looks kinda ugly and can get in the way. As at the moment I can’t put anything on one side of my base on the bottom floor.

4/8/2022,Hey new here but I think about grounded way to much in every day life. I'm a solo player and it's sucks.. But what would help would be a way to send resources to new locations down ziplines. Like a supply create you craft and fill and boom you can build a base faster without so much tracking over the map alone.... Also what about crafting a tool belt. Aka extra slots for just tools.. Hope these are good fresh ideas that grounded never knew it needed.,454,Feature,37,TRUE
4/9/2022,"considering how little uses the coal chunks have (just the oven, and coaltana/its repairs) i suggest that a new tier of shield, made with pupa leather, coal chunks, and antlion parts. it would be a shield that does a small amount of spicy damage to enemies on a perfect block. It would give players a reason to get this more costly shield instead of just using an easy to repair black ant one.",393,Item,25,FALSE
4/9/2022,"Making new types of beds and sleeping mechanics in the game can be a cool thing to put into the game. Like the only bed you have right now allows you to skip 8 hours of the night and the upgraded version of this can be a Crooked Weed plant bed that allows the player to skip 10 hours or 9. So on and so forth. Then the third tier bed allows you to skip the entire night always wake up at morning, and gives the player a buff that lasts for 3 minutes after waking up that gives the player hyper stamina and the quickness effect. Tier I bed (The one we have today) same stats. Tier II bed lowers the food and water depletion by 10% and gives the buffs for 1.5 minutes.

Praying Mantis Aggressive, Daytime Active (Potentially a miniboss or harder/equivalent enemy compared to wolf spiders) • T4 Weapon - Scythe that has a heavy attack that deals some AoE.

4/10/2022,i have an idea for a new resource type aswell as a new cutscene arrow and dagger type glass shards glass shards are a rare resource that can be harvested from chinese marbles these would require a black ox hammer how to get chinese marbles chinese marbles will appear in a jar near the house on the porche i think not sure what it is but they will be unavaliable to the player due to the fact that they are sealed in a jar how to make them harvestable the player will have to use 3 splatburst to knock the jar down therefor breaking it. shards for the jar itself wont be harvestable but instead will damage the player if you step on them uses you can make many types of weapons from glass shards including glass throwing knives glass daggers and glass arrows glass dagger the glass dagger will be a tier 3 dagger that can be used for chopping down grass throwing knives glass throwing knives are a throwable item that costs 1 glass shard they deal the damage of 1 hit from the glass dagger,989,Item,13,FALSE
4/10/2022,"New ""compatibility"" upgrades: Quick heads up, I am aware that new upgrades have been suggested before. All of which been new damage type suggestions (such as sweet and sour and seasoned) and I don't believe any of them have covered the idea that I have for how these could work. How it'd work: I won't go into too many details so the devs can implement it however they want but essentially, it would be a lower level, more early game version of the current ""candy enhancement forges"". We would be able to coat a weapon or tool in a substance that would allow it to function in a way that it previously couldn't on top of it's current use. How we'd do this this wether it be a new crafting station or a new tab in the upgrade station is entirely up to the devs. The Waterproof Gel/Marble: This would allow tools or weapons to function underwater at the cost of a large nerf in damage and speed, higher level upgrades would have it perform better underwater than it does on land, the higher upgrades would be exclusive to players who have gotten past the pond lab to keep players from skipping the intended pond weapons. The lesser upgrades are made with gel and the greater ones are made with marble. The gel: 5 wax, 3 eelgrass, 1 algae The marble: 3 waterproof gel, 2 sunken bone, 1 muscle sprout (so it can't be made before the lab is done) This is unfortunately only one example of what I'd like to suggest, sizzle/antlion gels that improve weapons when you enter the sandbox or grill. Berry/sap gels for the hedge and tree. Feather gels for increased attack range. Fuzz gels for increased attack speed are all things this suggestion originally contained but unfortunately do not fit within 1900 characters.",1709,Item,12,FALSE

4/11/2022,"water heater: As many of us know, there is a hot spring in the grill scorch zone which restores health (and, in my opinion, is the best feature in the entire game) which is pretty understandable considering it's one of the only sources of health in an environment where you are constantly taking damage. What I don't understand however, is why the devs went out of their way to make a new status effect, new particles and a new map landmark for this only to use it once and not have them all over the map or better yet, wherever the player decides. Introducing, the water heater: The build: The water heater would only be buildable in small shallow puddles (so not the pond or flooded zones). It'd be a relatively cheap item, it'd be made from approximately 4 clay, 1 boiling gland and maybe even some dry grass. It'd resemble a really small oven and would function like one too (by heating the water with fire) The fuel for the item, however would not be so cheap. It would require an item called kindling The item: Kindling would cost: 5 sap and 15 dry grass in a workbench for 1 kindling 8 splinters in a grinder for 5 kindling 1 charcoal in a grinder for 5 kindling How it'd work: The heater would only be buildable only in water. It'd require somewhere between 10-15 kindling per heater to keep it active for about 5 in game days (about 2•5 hours irl) and would make said puddle restore health making it perfect for the sandbox oasis.

And as we speak of cool, this could be the chance to indroduce the opposite to the Sizzling system, the Cold System (or something like that) that would go up if you are under the Porch without any Source of Light. this would also be a place for ""Creatures of the dark"" like Cockroaches and Silverfish",721,Feature,38,TRUE

Bee spear: Split spearhead at level 7, enabling an occasional extra hit with 25% damage, sharp spearhead with 3 stingers curling at the base at level 9, increasing defense penetration. Crow Crossbow: Double bow heads at level 7, increasing arrow velocity, feather shield/sight at the head at level 9, allowing sighted aim and damage reduction while aiming.

4/13/2022,"Bugs with mutations: Imagine if you could find bugs with mutations from raw science exposure? Unique mutations that can't be acquired anywhere or anyway else. What if you got to hunt down and fight those bugs to steal their mutation? That's basically the whole premise of this suggestion, enjoy. Electrified mutation: This mutation would be found on one of the black soldier ants (in the black ant hill), this soldier ant would be easily identifiable by the fact that it glows blue, has electricity arcing from it's mandibles and has bright blue eyes instead of red. It'd be a mutation with only one level and would increase your stun damage by 75% but also restore the health of robots so don't use it to fight ark.Rs or tayz.Ts. Glass cannon mutation: This mutation would be found an orb weaver (in the bottom of the hedge, near the hits of crashed lab), the orb weaver would be identifiable by being somewhat translucent and looks like glass, the mutation would give you an amazing 175% damage increase but remove 75% of your max health making it incredibly high risk, high reward. These are only a few examples of what I had in mind, I was thinking of an antlion with an ""armoured"" mutation or a diving bell spider that's has a ""scientist"" mutation that increases raw science gain (the diving bell would be glowing with raw science). Most of these ideas just didn't fit within 1900 characters though.

4/14/2022,A grappling hook would be a cool thing to get from a tier three burgl chip. The grappling hook would be made with silver fish parts and lint rope.

Your ammunition,343,Item,16,FALSE
4/14/2022,"Battering Ram (Tier III) Description: It looks like a shield with Black Ox Beetle Horns on the front of it. It would also be made of strong Pupa Leather for effectiveness and Ladybird Parts for even more strength.

I fire a gas arrow, then loot the remaining thistle arrow. Now, the ""new"" thistle arrow is 1, and gas arrows and feather arrows get ""bumped"" to hotkeys 2 and 3 (from 1 and 2), respectively. The converse of this example is also frustrating, when after I've ""learned"" the new hotkey numbers, I run out of thistle arrow at 1, then go to load in a gas arrow at its ""new"" hotkey 2 only to find that they no longer exist at 2 because everything has ""bumped"" back down in number.",1256,Feature,4,FALSE
