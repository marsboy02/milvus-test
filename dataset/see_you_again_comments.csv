"Here is lyrics


It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I see you again",eae574bd7f16fa65a62f254a04128c14,2023-12-05T08:37:44Z,3,0

"It’s been 10 years since the talented actor, philanthropist, father, son & friend to many, Paul Walker unexpectedly & sadly got his wings. 

It’s been 7 years since my amazing, talented, hardworking, loving & devoted husband, father, son & friend to many, sadly & unexpectedly got his wings. 

It may seem as though time has passed quickly, for most people, throughout the past 7-10 years, however, for those of us left behind, every minute seems like an eternity until we see them again 

This was the song I chose to play during the picture montage at my husband‘s funeral, because not only was he a huge fan of Paul Walker’s acting & movies, he also loved this song. For me, 3:57  the message was so on the nose. Although it’s very hard to listen to without falling to pieces, it does make me feel closer to him and reminds me of God’s promise that we will see him again. 🪽💔🙏",423d7147c1ec9e5139f677c0a286607d,2023-12-03T09:55:35Z,0,0

I’m 16 years old and listening to this song just made me cry thinking of him, I miss him so much he was such close family he lived with us he ate with us he laughed with us and everything. A staff infection took his life from us which spread a disease and paralyzed him. I’m just glad he’s not in pain anymore.

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I see you again",5ad4090400fd0cf3ae058b227229cbe6,2023-12-02T11:53:20Z,1,0

"~ Beloved nothing really lasts long..!
Be it a thing or a loved one.""
Whichever pair of shoes is the most loved is the pair of shoes that gets torn first..!
Whichever clothes suit me best, the color of the clothes burns first -
Whenever you wear a pair of earrings or a pair of jewelry, your hands, ears, and throat swell up, surprisingly, there will be no problem with that favorite jewelry or pair of earrings...!
~When I read my favorite watch, my hands become more beautiful, the battery of that watch is destroyed or the bell is torn..!
-Whoever needs the loved one the most may be the first to leave, or not at all.
~Indeed in all troubles centering on the beloved word, the things we care for the most, the things we need the most, come to us for a very short time..!
That thing is with us for a very short time like you were in my life oyster....! 😰🥀",fee662ff97475e8f17e575ad8fbac907,2023-12-02T10:09:02Z,1,0

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

"Hoje o ator Paul Walker (1973-2013) e seu amigo piloto Roger Rodas (1975-2013) sofria um acidente fatal que custou as suas vidas no Valencia, um bairro de Santa Clarita, Califórnia! Este foi o dia mais triste para nós fãs da franquia Velozes & Furiosos (Fast & Furious), fiquei muito abalado com a notícia da morte do Paul já que sou fã da franquia tem quase duas décadas que eu acompanho (não me lembro o que estava fazendo no momento que foi anunciado a sua morte e de seu amigo)! Estava gravando o filme Velozes & Furiosos 7 já que tinha gravado a metade do filme e para finalizar o que estava faltando os seus irmãos foram dublê de corpo e dois anos depois foi lançado o filme que iria se tornar mais lucrativo da franquia (não me lembro se fui ver na primeira semana) e fui ver seu último filme e já sabia que iria sair arrasado quando acabou, e quando começou a homenagem para ele comecei a chorar muito (nunca tinha chorado assim pelo um artista) e ele é o único que me aconteceu vendo seus melhores momentos da franquia mais amado por mim, finalmente acabei sair da sala do cinema e a minha mãe me viu chorando muito! Todos os filmes lançados posteriores foram homenageado para ele já que não tem como lembrar do Brian O'Conner e tem homenagear mesmo! Sempre revejo a franquia para matar a saudades que sinto por você e outros filmes que ainda não vi!",41617efabd7b8c67d5b46f4d2c2ee334,2023-11-30T16:50:46Z,1,0

"It’s been 10 years since Paul Walker’s unfortunate passing… but while he may be gone from the accidental and questionable car collision, he was a true racer who raced long enough for all of us to know and experience his legacy and greatness. You did amazing playing as Brian O’Conner Paul, and just know that the road you’ve been racing won’t be forever forgotten… rest easy along with Roger Rodas…",0bec44e574396bc52d54729156a88644,2023-11-30T10:21:50Z,43,0

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)

The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - Warr Is Only Won With Love” are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 💝,74d4bdae74f64e408fce5d80bb58e5cb,2023-11-29T13:46:10Z,7,2

"One of my coworker, she brought me up like her daughter and loved me so much. We worked in a restaurant that I work right after graduating from middle school. People says that I look alike to her because I was raised by her and i was so happy that. I worked sooo hard to complete my job like her. It was my first timeI did something soooo hard.  And then, i came to Canada to study but we kept in touch. She often said she is waiting for me!!!! She cannot wait!! But today, she told me that she won’t be there when i’ll come back. She will quit because of so much abuses from our manager. 
I just want to tell her that i love you too and thank you soooo much. It’s very sad that you are not there when i come back.  See you again.",64ea985446bca220b5eb63a7f6dcbdc5,2023-11-29T03:37:28Z,1,0

"Every time I listen to this song, I think about my now graduated friends that left me behind after 3 years of me knowing them.

Here's the story:

It all started when me and the friend I now have on discord met each other when I was a freshman in highschool, in the first year, me, him and another friend of his played Yu-Gi-Oh Nexus together. After that year, we had to same class again, but this time, he and more of his friends played SSBU (Super Smash Bros Ultimate for those who don't know) together, I was intrigued by their skill and I joined them, from what I distinctively remember, a few weeks later. That's when the friend I have on discord become my SSBU tag team partner, I played Simon, he played Richtor, I played Lucina, he played Marth, HECK, we've done double Ganondorf and so much more. That is when I truly felt a connection between us. In my junior and his senior year, which was last year, we still played SSBU, and I never thought I would build a new connection between me, him and his friends. When they had to leave 2 weeks before graduation during our yearly senior walkout, I was crying tears of emotion, knowing they were gonna be gone when they graduated 2 weeks from that day. 2 weeks later, I went to their graduation to help National Honors Society with passing out programs, not only that, I wanted to support my friends all the way through the program, best of all, they DID NOT know I was there. At the end, I never had a final encounter with those friends to say a final farewell..... but there was something coming from a friend I had never had before...... The friend on discord sent me this exact message, ""Thank you for everything! You're an amazing friend!"" That is where I CRIED tears of emotion, because I have never had a friend that was THAT supportive to me, EVER. That was the last I have heard from him or the others......That is how those 3 years (2020-2023) were some of the best years of my highschool life.😭

I still think about them to this day 🥺



UPDATE AFTER SUMMER 2023: I am doing well....but I am still depressed they are gone.....But they will always be in my heart.....forever 😭",fdcce31a73d9b93f2e5062a9a050ff6a,2023-11-28T17:19:21Z,1,0

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)",f18049203ecb1e9f50ee628de95f816f,2023-11-28T11:29:40Z,0,0

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I lost my big brother in 2008 when I m 19 years old. I have no idea how to survive in the world. Bcoz my brother always guide me. After I lost him. I saw a new world & also everything happened to me I got surprised and sometimes I m thinking how people change with your good time or bad time. In our Muslim culture as we all know inshaallah one day I meet again my brother & I m telling him what is happened to me after I lost u bro. That time I play this song & I think it's the perfect song to tell him how much pain I have get from the people that we think anything can happen in our life they always stand for us. How fool we are. That's why this song so special to me. Thank u guy's making such a great song.,5e00ff5277ff0a4273ff011b1f76a32d,2023-11-25T19:55:58Z,4,1

"I just recently lost my dog who was less than one year younger than me. She was 14 and I was 15 and the bond I had with her was so strong that when we put her down because of old age, I didn't cry as I watched her slip away. I wanted to so badly but I just held it in. I had asked my mom to play this song when she was given the last dose of what stops there heart and she said yes, but she didn't do it. But I don't think that matters because every time I cry when I hear this song, I know that it's because my dog and I, we knew that we would someday be together agian.",98ab2d397847199cbc88cc3f8f5ef95d,2023-11-25T15:22:59Z,1,0

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began

"It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different
See the bigger picture
Those were the days hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh, how could we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you be gon' with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I see you again)
We've come a long way from where we began (came a long way)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (let me tell you)
When I see you again
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turn to a friendship
A friendship turned into a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost (never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
When that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone (remember me when I'm gone)
How could we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?,
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you be gon' with me for the last ride
Let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, oh, oh, oh
It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Ah, ah, ah, ah, uh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, uh
When I see you again, see you again, yeah
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, yeah
When I see you again

"On the authority of Abu Al-Darda’, may God be pleased with him, on the authority of the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, he said: “Whoever follows a path seeking knowledge, God will make easy for him a path to Paradise. Indeed, the angels lower their wings for the seeker of knowledge, satisfied with what he does, and the world seeks forgiveness for him from whomever is in the heavens and whoever is on earth, even the whales.” In the water, and the superiority of the scholar over the worshiper is like the superiority of the moon over all the other stars, and that the scholars are the heirs of the prophets, and that the prophets did not leave behind a dinar or a dirham, but rather they inherited knowledge, so whoever takes it will have an abundant share.”

"Lyrics
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all ab
out it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I see you again

혹시 다른 수익이나 그런 목적은 아니고, 제가 혼자서 유튜브에 연습용으로 최근에 나온 spinning globe이라는 노래와 매쉬업 해보고 싶다는 생각이 들었습니다.

"This song always reminds me of my college friends when we left for our careers. We had so many good memories together, laughing, crying, partying, studying, and dreaming. We promised to keep in touch and see each other again someday. But life is unpredictable and sometimes we lose contact or drift apart. I miss them so much and I hope they are doing well. Whenever I hear this song, I feel a mix of nostalgia, sadness, and gratitude. I thank them for being a part of my life and I hope they know how much I love them. This song is a tribute to our friendship and I dedicate it to them. I hope we can see each other again and relive those moments. Until then, I will keep them in my heart and pray for their happiness. 🙏❤️ I really miss you my guys😢",33421dad1ac47c7254ceb8feec4a1d0c,2023-11-18T14:59:39Z,14,2

"This song always makes me cry, especially the ending scene when Vin Diesel and Paul Walker go their separate ways. It’s such a beautiful tribute to Paul, who died in a car accident before the movie was finished. The way they used CGI to make him look alive and smile at Vin was so realistic and heartbreaking. I can’t imagine how hard it must have been for the cast and crew to film that scene, knowing that Paul was gone. They were like a family, and they lost one of their own. This song captures the love and friendship they shared, and the hope that they will see each other again someday. Rest in peace, Paul. You are missed by millions of fans around the world. 🙏🏼❤️😢",33421dad1ac47c7254ceb8feec4a1d0c,2023-11-18T14:57:10Z,256,14

"This song marks for me the weird, sad, contradictory but for some odd reason still comforting time of my life. At May 2015, as I myself was turning 14, my dad passed away without any symptoms in advance, of coronary artery disease, just a day before turning 50. In hindsight he couldn’t have had better way to go. He died at last day of any sort of youth and hence stays forever ”young”, which I also find somewhat poetic. He obviously finished a bit early but definitely in the way he’d always wanted doing his work he loved, far away from the eyes of us who’d get traumatized for the rest of our lives. 

The odd part is, and it may be a false memory but I reckon hearing this song somewhere a couple of days before, and I saw the movie just three weeks before the day about to change the very structure of my life. This song brings me contradictory vibe of warmth of the following summer of 2015 but reminds also about cathartic irreplaceability of long-gone beloved family member. ❤",4c30f59e43f5d4a1a7292f05f1337da3,2023-11-17T12:55:27Z,4,0

"My childhood friend passed away yesterday. Unfortunately, his cancer had returned... I don't know how to describe it... Losing one of my childhood friends is very sad... When I got the news, I thought it was a prank, but I soon realized it wasn't... That's when my heart broke into pieces...

He'll always be like an older brother to me... Our memories will remain alive in my heart, memories of shared laughter, unforgettable adventures, and moments that shaped our friendship. It's hard to accept the reality of his absence, but I promise to honor his memory by remembering our good times together.

Every time I look back, I will remember his warm presence and impact on my life. The longing will be eternal, as will the gratitude for having had him as a friend.
 
That's why I listen to this song to keep our memories.

Rest In Peace, Diogo

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began

"Lại một ngày dài nữa mà tôi thiếu vắng cậu
Và biết bao điều tôi muốn nói với cậu khi ta gặp lại nhau
Chúng ta đã đi qua cả chặng đường dài kể từ lúc khởi đầu
Tôi sẽ cùng cậu ôn lại nó khi ta gặp lại nhau
Khi ta gặp lại nhau
[Rap]
Ai hiểu hết được những chuyến bay mà chúng ta cùng cất cánh
Những chía ngọt sẻ bùi
Và vì thế mà tôi đang đứng tại đây
Nói với cậu về những chuyến đi sau này
Tôi biết chúng ta đều yêu những cung đường rộn rã tiếng cười
Nhưng tôi đã linh cảm mọi chuyện đều không thể kéo dài mãi mãi
Cần phải chấp nhận sự thay đổi, nhìn về phía xa hơn
Nhìn về tương lai tươi đẹp đánh đổi từ những tháng năm gian khó
Nay tôi thấy bạn ở một nơi tốt đẹp hơn
Làm thế nào mà chúng ta không nói về gia đình khi gia đình là tất cả những điều chúng ta có.
Bạn đã sát cánh cùng tôi trải qua mọi chuyện
Và bây giờ bạn đồng hành với tôi trong chuyến đi cuối cùng này
Lại một ngày dài nữa mà tôi thiếu vắng cậu
Và biết bao điều tôi muốn nói với cậu khi ta gặp lại nhau
Chúng ta đã đi được một quãng đường dài kể từ điểm bắt đầu
Tôi sẽ cùng cậu ôn lại nó khi ta gặp lại nhau
Khi tôi gặp lại  cậu
Ohhh Ohhh Ohh ohh
[Rap] 
Thuở ban đầu mỗi chúng ta đều có con đường riêng mình
Rồi sự kết nối dần dần trở nên mạnh mẽ
Từ những người quen trở thành người bạn, và từ người bạn trở thành người tri kỷ
Sự tri kỷ ấy không ai có thể chia rẽ được, đó là thứ tình thân không thể mất đi
Và khi tình anh em vượt trên mọi ranh giới
Thì sẽ không có gì cản trở được chúng ta
Một khi chạm tới ngưỡng giới đó thì xin hãy nhớ tới tôi kể cả lúc tôi phải ra đi
Làm thế nào mà chúng ta không nói về gia đình khi gia đình là tất cả những điều chúng ta có.
Bạn đã sát cánh cùng tôi trải qua mọi chuyện
Và bây giờ bạn đồng hành với tôi trong chuyến đi cuối cùng này
Hãy để ánh đèn dẫn lối cho bạn

"Wiz Khalifa - See You Again ft. Charlie Puth [Official Video] Furious 7 Soundtrack

Lyrics:

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I see you again",0cec3bf2e96629358a202553ceb28cef,2023-11-14T03:51:54Z,0,0

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again

First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)

When I see you again",cdca934eec0be97733694fccc16c6b67,2023-11-13T08:07:11Z,23,1

I would make a slight change just cuz I like how the chords flow for the chorus in this way:

           Em   G       C          G  
It's been a long day without you my friend
         C          G                Am        G
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
              Em  G        C          G
We've come a long way from where we began
         C         G                 Am        G
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
        Am       G
When I see you again

-In the chorus, the last two times he sings : ""when i see you again"", I like to play ""Cadd9"" instead of C, adds that high pitch a little bit more in contrary to rest of the chorus.

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
Tem sido um longo dia sem você, meu amigo

And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
E eu te contarei tudo quando eu te vir de novo

We've come a long way from where we began
Fizemos um longo caminho desde onde começamos

Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
Oh, eu te contarei tudo quando eu te vir de novo

When I see you again
Quando eu te vir de novo


Damn, who knew?
Caramba, quem diria

All the planes we flew
Todos os aviões que voamos

Good things we've been through
As coisas boas que passamos

That I'd be standing right here talking to you
Que eu estaria bem aqui falando com você

'Bout another path
Sobre outro caminho

I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
Sei que adorávamos pegar a estrada e rir

But something told me that it wouldn't last
Mas algo me dizia que aquilo não iria durar

Had to switch up
Tive que mudar

Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Olhar as coisas de modo diferente, ver a coisa como um todo

Those were the days
Aqueles foram grandes dias

Hard work forever pays
O trabalho duro sempre compensa

Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Agora te vejo em um lugar melhor (te vejo em um lugar melhor)


Uh
Oh

How can we not talk about family
Como podemos não falar sobre família

When family's all that we got?
Quando a família é tudo que nós temos?

Everything I went through
Tudo o que passei

You were standing there by my side
Você estava lá, ao meu lado

And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
E agora você vai continuar comigo para o último passeio


It's been a long day without you, my friend
Tem sido um longo dia sem você, meu amigo

And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
E eu te contarei tudo quando eu te vir de novo

We've come a long way from where we began
Fizemos um longo caminho desde onde começamos

Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
Oh, eu te contarei tudo quando eu te vir de novo

When I see you again
Quando eu te vir de novo


Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh


First, you both go out your way
Primeiro, vocês dois fazem seus caminhos

And the vibe is feeling strong
E a vibração se fortalece

And what's small turn to a friendship
E o que é pequeno se transforma em uma amizade

A friendship turn to a bond
Uma amizade se transforma em um laço

And that bond will never be broken
E esse laço nunca será desatado

The love will never get lost
O amor nunca será perdido


And when brotherhood come first
E quando a irmandade vem primeiro

Then the line will never be crossed
A linha nunca será cruzada

Established it on our own
Nós a estabelecemos por conta própria

When that line had to be drawn
Quando essa linha teve que ser desenhada

And that line is what we reached
E essa linha foi o que alcançamos

So remember me when I'm gone
Então lembre-se de mim quando eu me for


How can we not talk about family
Como podemos não falar sobre família

When family's all that we got?
Quando a família é tudo o que nós temos?

Everything I went through
Tudo o que passei

You were standing there by my side
Você estava lá, ao meu lado

And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
E agora você vai continuar comigo para o último passeio


So let the light guide your way, yeah
Então deixe a luz guiar seu caminho, sim

Hold every memory as you go
Guarde todas as lembranças enquanto você vai

And every road you take
E qualquer estrada que você pegar

Will always lead you home
Sempre o levará para casa

Home
Casa


It's been a long day without you, my friend
Tem sido um longo dia sem você, meu amigo

And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
E eu te contarei tudo quando eu te vir de novo

We've come a long way from where we began
Fizemos um longo caminho desde onde começamos

Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
Oh, eu te contarei tudo quando eu te vir de novo

When I see you again
Quando eu te vir de novo


Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

When I see you again
Quando eu te vir de novo

See you again
Te vir de novo

When I see you again
Quando eu te vir de novo",8617c9d75b262c550c1565eb0dbe24f2,2023-11-12T03:51:30Z,25,0

"I dont know why or how, i only started watching fast and furios like a week ago, ive seen the past 4 parts, and im already obsessed, on television, now they show every week, and i cant wait to watch every one, but paul, was definitely my favorite, i got dissapointed when he didnt show up in the 3-rd part, and when my mom told me he died, i didnt take it that seriously, but a bit later, i started to think- why him? Why was he the one to go? Then i didnt even know this song is about him, when i leaned, i dont know why i got so sad, i wanted to tear up, amd now i listend to it, barly holding back tears.

"I had heard the movies ""Fast & Furious"", but I have not watch any of them; don't know why.
Same thing about Paul Walker's tragedy.
Recently, I watched all of them (of course, except that Part 2) in a few weeks. I love them so much: particularly Dominic's dinner grace, it means somethings to everyone.

I lost my dear friend Hong, one week ago.
Suddenly, this video shows up in my YouTube mix, don't know why, again.
Thanks YouTube.
Thanks Wiz Khalifa & Charlie Puth

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place, uh

How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah

First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
When I see you again

Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
When I see you again",3eed13ddc771d6bb3fd35aec7c9f579b,2023-11-09T13:17:14Z,0,0

Paul Walker, you were very family oriented and played the main character in ""Wild Speed"" beautifully. You made an impact on the people you co-starred with. They long to see you again. I too have longed to meet you, but that wish was not granted and you have passed away.
I am truly sorry for your loss.




ポール・ウォーカー、あなたはとても家族思いで、『ワイルド・スピード』の主人公を見事に演じていた。あなたは共演した人々にインパクトを与えた。彼らはあなたにまた会いたいと願っている。私もあなたにお会いしたいと切望していましたが、その願いはかなわず、あなたはこの世を去ってしまいました。

"YOU CAN SEE THEM AGAIN! Eternal Life is a free gift and it's the most awesome gift from God, all you have to do is receive it by faith.
Romans 3:23-For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.
Romans 5:8-But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
John 3:16-For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
Romans 10:9-13-If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, YOU WILL BE SAVED. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and ARE SAVED. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.” For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord WILL BE SAVED.”
John 5:24-Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, HATH everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
1 John 5:1-Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ IS BORN OF GOD: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.
1 John 5:10-He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
Romans 8:16-The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:
Romans 6:11-Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Ephesians 2:10-For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we SHOULD walk in them.
1. Admit to God you have sinned against Him.
2. Believe and trust in the Gospel.
Gospel--->1 Corinthians 15:3-4-For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
Ephesians 1:13-14- In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were SEALED with that holy Spirit of PROMISE, Which is the EARNEST of our inheritance UNTIL THE REDEMPTION OF THE PURCHASED POSESSION, unto the praise of his glory.
3. Submit yourselves a living sacrifice just as he's done for you, not out of a slave-mentality but out of the same love and compassion he's shown you! God Bless!",327741dba6a8f879104c4c8ab8dd76d8,2023-11-08T02:45:03Z,2,0

"Lyrics
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I see you again

And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?

And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place, uh

How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah

First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
When I see you again

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)

"The friend who showed me this song died 28 years old. Never for a moment thought I’d be here in this moment. I’m a mechanic, he helped me convert an automatic to a manual, I taught him how to work on his own cars. He was amazed when I took something apart in a place where my hands could fit, but the eyes couldn’t see. He had a keen eye for detail and a mind quick as a whip. He’s with his mom and dad now, I hope he never feels alone again…. See you on the flip side Zap.",6c1554a26b623064554c1eca893ae5b3,2023-11-01T22:01:32Z,1,0

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)

"See You Again (feat. Charlie Puth) 
 Wiz Khalifa 

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)

Uh
How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turn to a friendship
A friendship turn to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost

And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home
Home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
When I see you again
See you again
When I see you again",55f9237e81369cbd97c5ae2be5fbb5d0,2023-10-28T19:56:31Z,2,0

"Ez volt az én temetésem valószínüleg...  Gorillaz - Clint Eastwood (Official Video) 
Régen hallottam ezt a számot mostmár tudom miről beszél ,akkor még zéró angolt értettem . És tudom ilyen alkalomra írodott . Most már világos! 1998 ban 11 éves voltam amikor alakult ez a zenekar . 2001 ben amikor ez a szám ment hivatalosan a rádióban 14 éves voltam. 2000 ben volt a teljes napfogyatkozás. És probálom összerakni a szöveget hogy boldog vagyok egy szemetes zsákban... 11 éves koromban mármint én. Mert elméletileg nekem írják a dalokat ha jól értem beleértve a filmzenéket is! Valószínüleg meghaltam és felkerültem a ""felhőbe"" és ott ugyanugy folytatodott tovább az életem , tehát nem éreztem semmit belőle hogy már nem élek. Szerintem ez lehet a magyarázat erre a videóklippre.

Viszont én nem szeretnék bosszút állni és világvégét csak egyszerűen le élni az életem normálisan békességben a családommal .",b92a35adfc2aeef7536df2c90fc121d8,2023-10-27T21:32:59Z,1,0

'See You Again' serves as a timeless reminder that the memories we hold dear continue to shape our lives long after our loved ones have departed. Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth have created a masterpiece that echoes the profound beauty of cherished connections and the enduring legacy of those who remain in our hearts forever.

"CSAK EGY KÉRDÉS? Például . Ha valakit a születése

pillanatában kiválasztanak az égből egy megtisztelelő pozicióra

,feladatra ami annak a személynek a halála napjáig érvényes ,

tehát nem tudja megfosztani őt senki ettől a poziciótól amíg csak

él. És az ő élete intervallumjában biztosan nem semmisülhet meg

a föld nevű bolygó amíg ő él. Akkor miért akarja valaki

mindenáron azt a személyt megölni és átvenni az ő pozicióját,

mikor oda fentről az égből nem véletlenül esett rá a választás, mert

rajta kivűl az egész univerzumban senki nem tudja betölteni ezt a

pozicíót helyette! Nagy kérdések ezek... Egyébként , őszinte részvétem!  Kedveltem ezt a filmet.",b92a35adfc2aeef7536df2c90fc121d8,2023-10-27T16:16:31Z,1,0

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I see you again",bc978f84fa7ae66a26b34b4415f138d3,2023-10-26T02:24:54Z,28,1

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I see you again",7e04931dd84adecb57746a58e2aa7789,2023-10-24T18:06:08Z,38,0

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)

Uh
How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turn to a friendship
A friendship turn to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost

And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home
Home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
When I see you again
See you again
When I see you again",bd97fa8c4e0cf2140ff16e0f54e8f67f,2023-10-23T13:52:57Z,1,0

"I still can't believe he passed. I was in the last year of highschool when I saw the news on the internet. I didn't want to believe it at first, I was sure it was stupid clickbait - the internet was absolutely full of them at the time. Yet, something drove me to click the news site. And it was true. 

I was shocked. I always loved him the most from the series, looked up to him and to hear he died was a major shock.
Rest in peace, Paul, we'll miss you. And thank you for all the great memories you gave.",24d95432fcd1ff2cb3658133c0c93d63,2023-10-22T21:00:55Z,3,1

We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh

And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

"Der Film ist so eine ergreifende, echte Dokumentation. ❤🔥🙏🏻

Ich war schon mehrere Male in dem Film. Man müsste Ihn immer wieder schauen. Um alles aufnehmen und die gesamte Geschichte nachvollziehen zu können.

Brillante Arbeit‼️👌🏻🔥

Der Abschluss, müsste mit dem Lied für Philipp und dem dazugehörigen Videoclip beendet werden. Das fehlt, als der perfekte End/ Zusammenfassung als Schluss. 

Ein Traum an Erbe für die Menschheit. 

So ein kurzes Leben und so ne riesen Erbe. ❤‼️🙏🏻😊


Dankend Euch allen ❤🙏🏻‼️🔥

"See You Again (Lyrics)

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again

First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)

When I see you again

"SANTA CATARINA E SÃO CIPRIANO, que (nome do amado) nesse momento esteja pensando em mim, (seu nome), e querendo a todo custo estar ao meu lado, querendo me ver, me abraçar e me beijar

.Que sua boca sinta muita vontade de me beijar e que sua mente só tenha a minha presença. Que (nome do amado) me procure ainda hoje, AGORA, me chamando para ficar ao seu lado e dizendo que me ama e que tomou a decisão certa e definitiva. Assim seja! ~

MINHA SANTA CATARINA E SÃO CIPRIANO, peço assim: vá onde (nome do amado) estiver e faça com que ele não descanse enquanto não falar comigo, (seu nome), pelos poderes da terra, pela presença do fogo, pela inspiração do ar, pelas virtudes das águas, invoco as 13 almas Benditas

.Pela força dos corações sagrados e das lágrimas derramadas por amor, para que se dirija onde (nome do amado) estiver e me dê muito amor, carinho e queira ficar COMIGO PRA SEMPRE.

Que (nome do amado) jamais deseje outra pessoa QUE NÃO SEJA EU, (seu nome), e que (nome do amado) tenha olhos só para mim, (seu nom e).Salve SANTA CATARINA E SÃO CIPRIANO, te peço assim: 

SOPRE O MEU NOME, (seu nome), NO OUVIDO DE (nome do amado). INTERCEDAM ao meu favor, INTERCEDAM ao meu favor e traga (nome do amado) pra mim. E pedindo assim: Ar move, fogo transforma, água forma, terra cura, e vai INTERCEDENDO, e INTERCEDENDO, vai trazer para mim (nome do amado) de volta o mais rápido possível, louco e muito apaixonado.
Que dessa vez ele volte definitivamente pros meus braços. Que (nome do amado) ame somente a mim e me faça
muito feliz.
Que seja carinhoso comigo, que não consiga olhar para nenhuma outra mulher que não seja eu, (seu nome). Que se sinta bem somente ao meu lado, que sinta minha falta e venha ao meu encontro, e me peça para que eu nunca o abandone.
Que (nome do amado) queira ficar comigo PRA SEMPRE. Assim seja, assim será, assim está feito. Salve
SANTA CATARINA E SÃO CIPRIANO, conheço as suas forças e os seus poderes, lhes peço que atendam o meu
pedido.
Que (nome do amado) não durma e não descanse se não tiver a certeza que estamos juntos, que o corpo de (nome do amado) queime de desejo por mim, (seu nome).

Que (nome do amado) fique cego para outras mulheres, que ele não consiga ver ninguém como mulher, que outras mulheres nunca consigam chamar atenção dele, somente eu terei esse poder.
Que (nome do amado) não consiga nunca ter desejo e nem fazer com NENHUMA outra mulher QUE NÃO
SEJA EU, (seu nome).
Que (nome do amado) me assuma de vez em seu coração. Façam SANTA CATARINA E SÃO CIPRIANO com que (nome do amado) sinta-se bem somente em ouvir minha voz E QUE ELE ME DESEJE PRA SEMPRE.
Que (nome do amado) sinta por mim, (seu nome), um desejo fora do normal, como nunca sentiu por ninguém e nunca sentirá por nenhuma outra mulher que não seja eu, (seu nome).
Pelos ANJOS que acompanham seus passos, rogo e suplico que amarrem (nome do amado) nos MEUS
BRAÇOS, somente para mim, (seu nome).
Agradeço por estar trabalhando ao meu favor e vou divulgar seu nome em troca desse pedido, minha gloriosa SANTA CATARINA E SÃO CIPRIANO.
Tragam (nome do amado) para mim hoje, agora e sempre, fazendo com que ele se torne meu definitivamente. Ainda que (nome do amado) resista, que com seus poderes SANTA CATARINA E SÃO CIPRIANO, soprem o meu
nome, (seu nome), no ouvido dele para que ele me procure hoje.
Que (nome do amado) não consiga parar de pensar em mim, (seu nome), não consiga ficar longe de mim, (seu nome), pois terá medo de me perder.
Que venha feito uma cobra rastejante, humilde e e manso, que venha dizendo que me quer sempre ao seu lado, e assim possamos ter um bom convívio.
Assim seja e assim será! Eu profetizo em nome do Pai, do Filho e do Espírito Santo, que (nome do amado) vai vir correndo atrás de mim, (seu nome), AGORA, louco e apaixonado, o mais rápido possível, pedindo para ficar
comigo PRA SEMPRE, pois somente minha boca terás vontade e prazer de beijar.
(Nome do amado), você vai me assumir de vez em seu coração. Confio no poder de SANTA CATARINA E SÃO CIPRIANO!!!
Cada vez que for lida essa oração, mais forte ela se fará. Estarei publicando esta oração como oferenda,
pedindo que me conceda o pedido de fazer com que (nome do amado) fique para sempre comigo.
Sei que os ANJOS já estão soprando o meu nome, (seu nome), no ouvido de (nome do amado), e ele não conseguirá fazer MAIS nada ENQUANTO não VIER falar comigo.
Confio nos poderes de SANTA CATARINA E SÃO CIPRIANO E DOS ANJOS e vou continuar divulgando
essa oração poderosa por sete dias. Que assim seja, assim será e assim está feito. EM NOME DE SANTA CATARINA E SÃO CIPRIANO EU
SUPLICO… está feito",ce3140ecb6ee4041be1a7222a67d82dc,2023-10-19T02:02:43Z,0,0

And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)

When I see you again",d4f5297d2794a9a0328edf9fdb0e7ddd,2023-10-18T23:42:01Z,0,0

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I see you again",6449e7fb52f1b880e87225d575a82e5d,2023-10-15T04:56:32Z,92,4

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I see you again",ee91d04b142445f8c32588bb24331dd2,2023-10-14T04:07:27Z,58,3

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began

"Prayers for the people of Israel, 👃.  Lord, I'm so sorry for what the country of Israel has gone through, 😢.  The terrible deeds done by pure evil and torture.  Lord, please be with the family members as they go through a terrible situation.  I can't even imagine how they are feeling and I'm truly sorry for what has happened to them because they never deserved it.  Give them peace, Lord, as they try to get through the hard and terrible times that they're facing at the moment.  It's not fair for what they have gone through.  Romans 12:21 ""Do not be  overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good"".  Amen!",afadd970b77f6aca3cfddc5e22aae39e,2023-10-12T21:59:33Z,1,0

Now the war between Israel and Hamas is going on and already many people were killed. I'm praying that this music video creates lots of vibration of love and compassion. This video will protect all the people in the war area of Isreal and Hamas. Whoever saw this video will have to be protected. Whoever saw this video will love and respect each other. ,eab6d15842f6ffa232a55e505e6878bc,2023-10-12T07:26:59Z,2,0

I lost my brother this August and I keep listening to this song because it describes us so much. We weren't blood but it could be said water sometimes is thicker than blood. We may not have shared blood but he was my brother. Happy birthday bro and rest in power just have a drink waiting for me,a5fba042e18b9cbc560704156e5f9094,2023-10-11T01:23:57Z,25,8

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)
Uh

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Charlie Puth & Wiz Khalifa:]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (Yeah, we came a long way) from where we began
(You know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again

[Charlie Puth:]
Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah

[Wiz Khalifa:]
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Charlie Puth:]
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Charlie Puth & Wiz Khalifa:]
Aah oh, aah oh (Uh)
Yeah (Yeah)
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yo)
When I see you again (Yo, uh)
See you again (Yo, yo)
Oh-oh (Uh-huh)
(Yup) When I see you again",15ade1a145c66f25356956396b3b65a9,2023-10-11T01:09:27Z,15,0

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here
Talking to you 'bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way) from where we began
(You know what we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
Aah oh, aah oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Yeah)
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turn to a friendship, a friendship turn to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost (the love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reach
So remember me when I'm gone (remember me when I'm gone)
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Aah oh, aah oh (uh)
(Yeah)
Ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (yeah)
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah)

"It's been a long day, without you my friend.
And I'll tell you all about it.
When I see you again.
We've come a long way from where we began.
Oh, I'll tell you all about it.
When I see you again.
When I see you again.

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew.
Good things we've been through.
That I'll be standing right here talking to you.
About another path.
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh.

But something told me that it wouldn't last.
Had to switch up.
Look at things different see the bigger picture.
Those were the days.
Hard work forever pays.
Now I see you in a better place.

Oh.
How could we not talk about family?
When family's all that we got.
Everything I went through.
You were standing there by my side.
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride.

It's been a long day, without you my friend.
And I'll tell you all about it.
When I see you again, I see you again.
We've come a long way, yeah we came a long way.
From where we began, you know we started.
Oh, I'll tell you all about it.
When I see you again, let me tell you.
When I see you again.

First you both go out your way.
And the vibe is feeling strong.
And what's small turn to a friendship.
A friendship turn to a bond.
And that bond will never be broken.
And the love will never get lost.
And the love will never get lost.

And when brotherhood come first.
Then the line will never be crossed.
Established it on our own.
When that line had to be drawn.
And that line is what we reach.
So remember me when I'm gone.
Remember me when I'm gone.

How could we not talk about family?
When family's all that we got.
Everything I went through.
You were standing there by my side.
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride.

So let the light guide your way, yeah.
Hold every memory as you go.
And every road you take.
Will always lead you home, home.

It's been a long day, without you my friend.
And I'll tell you all about it.
When I see you again.
We've come a long way from where we began.
Oh, I'll tell you all about it.
When I see you again.
When I see you again.

When I see you again.
See you again.

"I understand why people say they miss Paul.. and I do too... But this song is for everyone that has lost someone inside their heart.. I know this song breaks me as a 45 year old man missing a 80 year old man that was a father to me with no relation!  Best friends/father!!!

"Lyrics
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I see you again",b5e72de39f9e819d22db2d83241390c0,2023-10-06T07:36:20Z,28,0

"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I see you again",6553bcfd42ad8b338f632ffe6b26d88b,2023-10-05T20:29:04Z,4,0
